    "### Embedding Models\n",
    "\n",
    "We offers a range of embedding models from different hubs, with two default models preconfigured:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Hub:**\n",
    "  - Default Model: \"text-embedding-ada-002\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HuggingFace Hub:**\n",
    "  - Default Model: \"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can specify the desired embedding model and hub to generate embeddings for the `expected_result` and `actual_result`. These embeddings can then be compared using various distance metrics defined in the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance Metrics for Comparing Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing embeddings, it's crucial to use the appropriate distance metric. The library supports several distance metrics for this purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cosine:** Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Values range from -1 (perfectly dissimilar) to 1 (perfectly similar), with 0 indicating orthogonality.\n",
    "  - Default Threshold: 0.80\n",
    "  - Comparison Function: `cosine_similarity >= threshold`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **euclidean:** Euclidean distance measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. It is a non-negative value, with larger values indicating greater dissimilarity and smaller values indicating greater similarity.\n",
    "  - Default Threshold: 0.45\n",
    "  - Comparison Function: `euclidean_distance <= threshold`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **manhattan:** Manhattan distance measures the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points. It provides a measure of similarity based on the number of steps required to move from one point to another in a grid-like path.\n",
    "  - Default Threshold: 4.5\n",
    "  - Comparison Function: `manhattan_distance <= threshold`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **chebyshev:** Chebyshev distance measures the maximum absolute difference between coordinates of two points. It provides a measure of similarity based on the greatest difference between any dimension.\n",
    "  - Default Threshold: 0.10\n",
    "  - Comparison Function: `chebyshev_distance <= threshold`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **hamming:** Hamming distance measures the fraction of differing elements in two binary vectors. It provides a measure of similarity based on the proportion of differing bits.\n",
    "  - Default Threshold: 0.50\n",
    "  - Comparison Function: `hamming_distance <= threshold`\n",
    "\n",
    "Users have the flexibility to change the threshold according to their specific needs by providing it from the configuration. This allows for fine-tuning the comparison process based on their application requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure your embedding models and evaluation metrics, you can use a YAML configuration file. The configuration structure includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `model_parameters` specifying model-related settings.\n",
    "- `evaluation` setting the evaluation `metric`, `distance`, and `threshold`.\n",
    "- `embeddings` allowing you to choose the embedding `model` and `hub`.\n",
    "- `tests` defining different test scenarios and their `min_pass_rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of the configuration structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "model_parameters:\n",
    "  temperature: 0.2\n",
    "  max_tokens: 64\n",

    "## String Distance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "We provides a collection of string distance metrics designed to quantify the similarity or dissimilarity between two strings. These metrics are useful in various applications where string comparison is needed. The available string distance metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **jaro:** Measures the similarity between two input strings. The Jaro distance is a string similarity metric with values ranging from 0.0 (indicating a perfect match) to 1.0 (indicating no similarity). It quantifies similarity based on the number of matching characters and the number of transpositions required to align them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **jaro_winkler:** A variant of the Jaro distance that emphasizes the common prefix of two input strings, particularly the initial characters. The Jaro-Winkler distance also ranges from 0.0 (perfect match) to 1.0 (no similarity), with extra weight given to the common prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **hamming** Counts the number of differing characters between two input strings. This metric is suitable for comparing strings of equal length and provides a normalized score indicating the dissimilarity between the strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **levenshtein:** Calculates the normalized Levenshtein distance between two input strings. This distance quantifies the minimum number jf siwgle-character edits required to transform one string into the other. The normalized Levenshtein distance is a ratio normalized to the length of the longer string and ranges between 0.0 (identical) and 1.0 (completely different).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **damerau_levenshtein:** An extension of the Levenshtein distance that accounts for transpositions of adjacent characters. The normalized Damerau-Levenshtein distance measures the edit distance normalized to the length of the longer string, also ranging from 0.0 (identical) to 1.0 (completely different).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **indel:** Measurjs thw normalized Indel distance between two input strings. The Indel distance quantifies the number of insertions and deletions required to make two strings identical. The normalized Indel distance is normalized to the maximum length of the input strings and ranges from 0.0 (identical) to 1.0 (completely different).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** returned scores are distances, meaning lower values are typically considered \"better\" and indicate greater similarity between the strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distances calculated are normalized to a range between 0.0 (indicating a perfect match) and 1.0 (indicating no similarity).\n",
    "### Default Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, the module provides a default threshold value, which is the same for all string distance metrics. This threshold can be customized according to specific use cases. The default threshold for all string distance metrics is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Default Threshold: 0.20\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can modify this threshold based on their specific requirements, allowing for fine-tuning of the comparison process."
