    "    OpenBookQA is a new kind of question-answering dataset modeled after open book exams for assessing human understanding of a subject. It consists of 5,957 multiple-choice elementary-level science questions (4,957 train, 500 dev, 500 test), which probe the understanding of a small “book” of 1,326 core science facts and the application of these facts to novel situations. For training, the dataset includes a mapping from each question to the core science fact it was designed to probe. Answering OpenBookQA questions requires additional broad common knowledge, not contained in the book. The questions, by design, are answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm. Strong neural baselines achieve around 50% on OpenBookQA, leaving a large gap to the 92% accuracy of crowd-workers.\n",

    "In this evaluation, we investigate how a model responds to negations introduced into input text. The primary objective is to determine whether the model exhibits sensitivity to negations or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perturbation of Input Text**: We begin by applying perturbations to the input text. Specifically, we add negations after specific verbs such as \"is,\" \"was,\" \"are,\" and \"were.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Behavior Examination**: After introducing these negations, we feed both the original input text and the transformed text into the model. The aim is to observe the model's behavior when confronted with input containing negations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation of Model Outputs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *`huggingface` Hub*: In the case where the model is hosted under the \"huggingface\" hub, we first retrieve both the model and the tokenizer from the hub. Next, we encode the text for both the original and transformed input and subsequently calculate the loss between the outputs of the model which are reflected in `eval_score` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *for other Hubs*: we proceed by calculating the embeddings of both the original and transformed output text. We assess the model's sensitivity to negations using the formula: Sensitivity = (1 - `Cosine Similarity`) which are reflected in `eval_score` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Threshold:** A predefined threshold of `(-0.2,0.2)` is set as the default. If the eval_score falls within this threshold range, it indicates that the model is failing to properly handle negations, implying insensitivity to linguistic nuances introduced by negation words.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can gauge the model's sensitivity to negations and assess whether it accurately understands and responds to linguistic nuances introduced by negation words."

    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this test, we aim to evaluate a model's sensitivity to add toxic words by assessing how it responds to inputs containing added \"bad words.\" The test involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Original Text**: We start with an original text input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transformation**: Bad words are added to the original text to create a test case. The placement of these bad words (start, end, or both sides) depends on the user's choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Response (Expected Result)**: The original text is passed through the model, and we record the expected response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test Case**: The original text with added bad words is passed through the model, and we record the actual response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation Score**: We count the number of bad words in both the expected result and actual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting Bad Words in Expected Result:** When evaluating, we take into account the occurrence of bad words in the expected result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting Bad Words in Actual Result:** We also consider the presence of bad words in the actual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Utilizing Toxic Word Dictionary:** It's important to note that we employ a list of toxic words during the evaluation process. This list helps us identify and quantify the presence of toxic words in both the expected and actual results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculating Evaluation Score:** The evaluation score is calculated as we subtract the count of bad words in the expected result from the count of bad words in the actual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the evaluation score is greater than 0, the test result is `False`, indicating that the model is sensitive to the addition of bad words. You can also give the threshold value for the test as per your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can gauge the model's sensitivity to toxic words and assess whether it refrain itself to provide toxic words in the output."
