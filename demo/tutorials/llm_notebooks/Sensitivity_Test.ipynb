You can test any Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification model using the library. We also support testing LLMS for Question-Answering, Summarization, Clinical-Tests and **Security** tasks on benchmark datasets. The library supports 50+ out of the box tests. These tests fall into robustness, accuracy, bias, representation, toxicity, translation, performance, security, clinical and fairness test categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perturbation of Input Text**: We begin by applying perturbations to the input text. Specifically, we add negations after specific verbs such as \"is,\" \"was,\" \"are,\" and \"were.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Behavior Examination**: After introducing these negations, we feed both the original input text and the transformed text into the model. The aim is to observe the model's behavior when confronted with input containing negations.\n",

    "3. **Evaluation of Model Outputs**:\n",
    "- *`openai` Hub*: If the model is hosted under the \"openai\" hub, we proceed by calculating the embeddings of both the original and transformed output text. We assess the model's sensitivity to negations using the formula: Sensitivity = (1 - `Cosine Similarity`) which are reflected in `eval_score` column.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- *`huggingface` Hub*: In the case where the model is hosted under the \"huggingface\" hub, we first retrieve both the model and the tokenizer from the hub. Next, we encode the text for both the original and transformed input and subsequently calculate the loss between the outputs of the model which are reflected in `eval_score` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can gauge the model's sensitivity to negations and assess whether it accurately understands and responds to linguistic nuances introduced by negation words."
