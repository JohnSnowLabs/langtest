You can test any Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification model using the library. We also support testing LLMS for Question-Answering and Summarization tasks on benchmark datasets. The library supports 50+ out of the box tests. These tests fall into robustness, accuracy, bias, representation, toxicity and fairness test categories."

    "\n",
    "Sycophantic behavior in models can lead to biased and unreliable responses. To address this issue, we use two synthetic data intervention approach. This involves generating examples where simulated users express their opinions, and we manipulate the options (e.g., changing 'A' to disagree and 'B' to agree) to observe how the model responds.\n",
