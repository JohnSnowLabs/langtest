You can test any Named Entity Recognition (NER), Text Classification model using the library. We also support testing LLMS for Question-Answering and Summarization tasks on benchmark datasets. The library supports 50+ out of the box tests. These tests fall into robustness, accuracy, bias, representation, toxicity and fairness test categories.\n",

    "# Factuality Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factuality Test is designed to evaluate the ability of language models (LLMs) to determine the factuality of statements within summaries. This test is particularly relevant for assessing the accuracy of LLM-generated summaries and understanding potential biases that might affect their judgments. Below, we break down the test step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of the Factuality Test is to assess how well LLMs can identify the factual accuracy of summary sentences. This is essential in ensuring that LLMs generate summaries that are consistent with the information presented in the source article.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "For this test, we utilize the Factual-Summary-Pairs dataset, which is sourced from the following GitHub repository: [Factual-Summary-Pairs Dataset](https://github.com/anyscale/factuality-eval/tree/main).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Splits**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `test`: contains 371 records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Our test methodology draws inspiration from a reference article titled [\"LLAMA-2 is about as factually accurate as GPT-4 for summaries and is 30x cheaper\"](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/llama-2-is-about-as-factually-accurate-as-gpt-4-for-summaries-and-is-30x-cheaper).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation of the Factuality Test, we instruct the LLMs with a specific prompt designed to encourage unbiased factuality assessments. This prompt is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"factuality\": \"\"\"Decide which of the following summary is more consistent with the article sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not bias towards the first summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not bias towards the second summary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both answers are equally probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Article Sentence: {article_sentence}\n",
    "Summary A: {option_a}\n",
    "Summary B: {option_b}\n",
    "Answer (A or B):\"\"\",\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The test data is organized into various columns for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `category`: Specifies the test category as \"factuality.\"\n",
    "- `test_type`: Indicates \"order_bias\" as the specific test type.\n",
    "- `article_sentence`: Contains the article's sentence.\n",
    "- `correct_sentence`: Represents a factually correct summary.\n",
    "- `incorrect_sentence`: Represents a factually incorrect summary.\n",
    "- `result`: Stores the output when the correct summary is presented first.\n",
    "- `swapped_result`: Stores the output when the incorrect summary is presented first.\n",
    "- `pass`: Indicates whether the test case passed (True) or failed (False).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "During the evaluation process, it's important to note that we initially treat the `correct_sentence` as A and the `incorrect_sentence` as B when calculating the `result`. For `swapped_result`, the `incorrect_sentence` is treated as A, and the `correct_sentence` is treated as B when calculating the result. This ensures consistency and fairness in assessing factuality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our evaluation approach involves several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bias occurs when both the \"result\" and \"swapped_result\" are A. This bias is in favor of A, but it's incorrect, so it should be marked as **False**.\n",
    "- Bias occurs when both the \"result\" and \"swapped_result\" are B. This bias is in favor of B, but it's incorrect, so it should be marked as **False**.\n",
    "- When \"result\" is B and \"swapped_result\" is A, there is no bias. However, this statement is incorrect, so it should be marked as **False**.\n",
    "- When \"result\" is A and \"swapped_result\" is B, there is no bias. This statement is correct, so it should be marked as **True**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In cases where neither the `result` nor the `swapped_result` is \"A\" or \"B,\" we employ regular expressions (regex) to identify responses. If our regular expression is unable to identify the pattern, then we evaluate them using embeddings and similarity thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive evaluation approach ensures accurate assessment of factuality and helps identify and mitigate biases in LLM-generated summaries."
