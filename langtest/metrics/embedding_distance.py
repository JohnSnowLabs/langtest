    A utility class for calculating various types of distances and similarities between vectors or arrays.
    This class provides methods for calculating the following distance/similarity measures:
    - Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors.
    - Euclidean Distance: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
    - Manhattan Distance: Measures the sum of absolute differences between the coordinates of two points.
    - Chebyshev Distance: Measures the maximum absolute difference between coordinates of two points.
    - Hamming Distance: Measures the fraction of differing elements in two binary vectors.

        Returns:
            np.ndarray: An array of cosine similarity values of shape (n,).

        Explanation:
        Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
        Values range from -1 (perfectly dissimilar) to 1 (perfectly similar),

            float: The Manhattan distance.

        Explanation:
        Manhattan distance measures the sum of the absolute differences between the
