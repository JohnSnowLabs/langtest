{"document": "On March 8th, 2014, several citizens of Montgomery, Alabama, who had been imprisoned for failing to pay traffic fines, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, under 42 U.S.C. §1983, against the City of Montgomery, Alabama. The plaintiffs, represented by Equal Justice Under Law and private counsel, asked the court for a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs' rights were violated, compensation for the damages caused by the city's conduct, and attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs alleged they did not have the ability to pay for the traffic tickets and that the City should not have imprisoned them for failing to pay the traffic tickets when they did not attempt to determine whether the plaintiffs had an ability to pay.\n\nOn May 1, 2014, the district court (Judge Mark E. Fuller) granted a motion for a preliminary injunction. The injunction enjoined the city from attempting to collect monies owed to the city associated with traffic tickets by the plaintiffs. The city was also required to submit a comprehensive plan on how they will determine an individual's ability to pay for traffic fines. On August 20, 2014, the case was reassigned to Judge Myron H. Thompson, and on August 21, 2014, Judge Thompson extended the injunction until the court ordered a change.\n\nOn October 31, 2014, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the case because they entered into a settlement agreement about the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court granted this dismissal on November 17, 2014, and the court agreed to the plaintiffs’ request to maintain jurisdiction over the settlement in case of any breaches by the defendant. \n\nWithin the settlement, the Municipal Court of the City of Montgomery agreed to numerous changes in its operations, including using a microphone in its courtroom proceedings, notifying this plaintiff's counsel within 12 hours of a defendant being jailed for nonpayment of a fine, and training public defenders and prosecutors on compliance with Bearden v. Georgia and Turner v. Rodgers. The terms of the settlement agreement lasted up to three years.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Thompson formally closed the case, though the court retained jurisdiction over the settlement and allowed the parties to resolve the issue of attorneys' fees, which was subsequently resolved on January 16, 2015. \n\nOn April 2, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice with the court that the defendants willfully violated the settlement agreement. The matter seemed to be resolved quickly because on April 7, 2015, Judge Thompson ordered that no further action would be taken on the notice because defendants had taken corrective action. \n\nThe case is now closed.", "summary": "The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit on March 8, 2014, alleging that the City of Montgomery, Alabama, improperly imprisoned them for failing to pay traffic fines. They alleged that they did not have an ability to pay the fines due to their financial circumstances and that the city did not consider their ability to pay. On May 1, 2014, the District Court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the city from collecting more money from traffic tickets of plaintiffs'.

{"document": "On August 28, 2013, an indigent detainee in the Montgomery Municipal Jail filed this lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama. The plaintiff sued the City of Montgomery and the Honorable Milton J. Westry under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The petitioner, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, requested the court quash the Municipal Court order requiring the petitioner to serve an imprisonment term of 54 days. Petitioner claimed that the Municipal Court order violated  Sixth Amendment, due process, and equal protection clause. The plaintiff was an indigent woman who accumulated $2,714.00 in fines and fees on traffic tickets that she received in 2008 and 2009. On August 20, 2013, the plaintiff was arrested and brought to the Montgomery Municipal Jail. The next day, the plaintiff appeared before Defendant Judge Westry, who told the plaintiff that she must pay $1,554.00 immediately or serve 31 days in jail. When the plaintiff informed Judge Westry that she would not be able to pay after only recently securing a part-time job, Judge Westry ordered the that her outstanding fines be converted into a term of imprisonment in the Montgomery Municipal Jail. Petitioner was not appointed a lawyer during the previously described court proceeding. \n\nAfter filing an emergency petition for writ of certiorari, the case was removed from state court to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama on October 4, 2013. On the same day, the petitioner filed an amended complaint, seeking declaratory relief.  Another indigent detainee filed a similar suit after he was taken into custody to serve a 54 day sentence for his inability to pay his traffic fees. Cleveland v. City of Montgomery, 2014 WL 6461900, at *1 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). On October 28, 2013,  the petitioner filed a motion to consolidate both cases. On November 12, 2013, petitioners amended their complaint and additionally sought injunctive relief.  Judge Mark E. Fuller granted the motion to consolidate both cases on November 14, 2013. \n \nDiscovery began on December 23, 2013. During discovery, a similar case raising comparable claims,  Mitchell v. City of Montgomery, was filed. 2014 WL 6461900, at *1 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). The court in Mitchell v. City of Montgomery entered a preliminary injunction that ordered the City of Montgomery to submit a comprehensive set of judicial procedures to implement for the collection of future fines. On May 14, 2014, petitioners motioned to have limited participation in the Mitchell v. City of Montgomery hearing regarding the proposed judicial procedures. 2014 WL 6461900, at *2 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). On May 27, 2014, Judge Fuller granted the petitioners’ motion in part and denied it in part. Judge Fuller determined that the petitioners were only permitted to participate in the Mitchell hearings orally and through ancillary briefings to provide perspective on the legal sufficiency of the City’s proposed plan. Cleveland v. City of Montgomery, 300 F.R.D. 578, 581 (M.D. Ala.

Nov 17, 2014). On August 28, 2014, both parties submitted a joint motion to approve the proposed settlement agreement. In the initial agreement, both parties submitted an agreement to pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys fees and provide a list of basic premises and procedures that the Montgomery Municipal Court would abide by with regards to indigent defendants unable to pay any court-ordered monies, including fines, court costs, or restitution. The parties filed an amended joint motion for entry of agreed settlement order on September 12, 2014. The amended motion included a joint brief in support and requested that the court issue three declarations: <blockquote> (1) Under the current status of the law,  the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983), regarding incarceration for non-payment, and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S.Ct. 2507, 180 L.Ed.2d 452 (2011), regarding notice, apply in municipal-court proceedings, and that, to the extent applicable in a particular case, the judges of the Montgomery Municipal Court are legally required to follow them.\n(2) that the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the constitutional principles set out in Bearden, regarding incarceration for non-payment, and Turner, regarding notice. In Bearden, the Supreme Court held that, under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause, a trial court cannot “automatically revok[e] probation because [a] petitioner could not pay his fine, without determining that petitioner had not made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay or that adequate alternative forms of punishment did not exist.” 461 U.S. at 662.\n(3) the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the requirements of the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, §§ 13, 64, and 225 of the Alabama Constitution, and Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. </blockquote>2014 WL 6461900, at *3-5 (M.D. Ala.

In the amended complaint, petitioners alleged that the imprisonment orders violated their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. Petitioners sought remedy through injunctive and declaratory relief. In 2014, the parties reached a settlement that provided new judicial procedures for the Municipal Court to follow regarding indigent defendants and nonpayment. It also included three declarations, most importantly, it declared that the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S.

{"document": "On May 1, 2006, an inmate awaiting execution at the Supermax Unit of the Arkansas Department of Correction filed this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Represented by the Federal Public Defender, the inmate claimed that the procedures used to carry out lethal injections in Arkansas—specifically the use of potassium chloride in the lethal cocktail of drugs—risked unnecessary conscious suffering in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief against the execution practices employed by the Arkansas Department of Corrections (ADC). He did not challenge his sentence or challenge the use of lethal injection. \n\nOn May 4, 2006, a second death row inmate in Arkansas moved to intervene. A few days later, his execution was scheduled for July 5 of that year. On May 26, the district court (Judge Susan Webber Wright) allowed him to intervene as a plaintiff. \n\nOn June 16, following his addition to the case, the second plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from carrying out executions in accordance with the lethal injection protocol. At the hearing on the motion, a medical expert testified that the state's lethal injection procedure created medically unacceptable risks of inflicting pain and suffering. Judge Wright granted the motion on June 26, noting that the plaintiff had not delayed in filing to intervene because he had had to wait to exhaust all of his appeals. The order granting the preliminary injunction stayed the State of Arkansas from implementing the order for execution of the second plaintiff. And four days later, the defendants appealed.\n\nIn the midst of ruling on the preliminary injunction appeal, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint, arguing that the plaintiff could not state a claim. First, they argued that the plaintiff had not exhausted all of the remedies available to him under the Department of Correction’s grievance policy. Second, the claim fell outside the statute of limitations for § 1983 actions. Judge Wright disagreed and denied the motion to dismiss on June 19, 2006. \n\nOn November 22, 2006, a third death row inmate sought to intervene. On December 1, 2006, Judge Wright granted the motion. \n\nOn July 7, 2007 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the preliminary injunction granted by the district court and vacated the stay of execution issued to the second plaintiff. The Court of Appeals found that the district court abused its discretion in granting the stay of execution and the preliminary injunction. Because the inmate could have brought his § 1983 claim before it was necessary to grant a stay, the district court exceeded the scope of its power to grant the preliminary injunction. 491 F.3d 804.\n\nOn July 17, 2007 the defendants filed for summary judgment. They argued that Arkansas's lethal injection protocol was substantially identical to the protocol used by the state of Missouri, which was upheld against constitutional challenge by the Eighth Circuit in <i>Taylor v. Crawford</i>, 487 F.3d 1072 (8th Cir. 2007). In their reply to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs argued that they had not been provided with the opportunity to engage in discovery, and that a significant number of genuine issues of material fact remained even without discovery. \n\nOn August 5, 2008 the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dissolved the stay of execution. The district court relied on the Eighth Circuit's approval of Missouri's lethal injection protocol, which the court found was sufficiently similar to Arkansas' protocol. The district court found that the plaintiffs had failed to come forward with evidence that Arkansas' protocol for execution by lethal injection \"subject[ed] them to constitutionally significant risk of pain.\"\n\nOn August 29, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an appeal. On February 8, 2010 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's summary judgment for the defendants. The Court found that Arkansas' protocol was substantially similar to Missouri's protocol upheld by the Court of Appeals and to Kentucky's protocol upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, the United States Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari. At the time of this writing, the original plaintiff had not been executed. The second plaintiff was granted a stay in 2017. The third plaintiff was executed on April 24, 2017. The case is now closed.

The plaintiffs sued Maricopa County and Treatment Assessment Screening Center, Incorporated, a private company, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Civil Rights Corps and private counsel, sought injunctive and monetary relief, claiming violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs alleged that the Maricopa County Attorney's Office and Treatment Assessment Screening Center jointly operated a marijuana possession diversion program that discriminated against the poor in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and led to unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, the defendants were, under threat of felony prosecution, subject to longer terms of imprisonment, repeated drug tests and increased fee payments due to their inability to pay fees associated with the program. One class member individually sought injunctive relief to prevent Maricopa County from keeping her in the diversion program if she could not pay the fees associated with completing the program. The case was assigned to Judge James A. Teilborg but immediately reassigned to Judge Steven P. Logan.\n\nOn October 12, 2018, the case was reassigned to Judge James A. Soto.

Magistrate Judge Eric J. Markovich denied all these motions in a June 18, 2019 order (2019 WL 2515950). He stated that the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded the elements of a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim and that, because the violations of rights were ongoing, there is no statute of limitations concerns. As for the Treatment Assessment Screening Center, he stated that the group was not subject to qualified immunity because it was being sued as an organization, not in individual capacity. He also wrote that the County Attorney was eligible for suit because he oversaw what the plaintiffs allege is a discriminatory practice. He added that as a municipality, the County Attorney was not subject to sovereign immunity.  \n\nOn September 23, 2019, the plaintiffs submitted a second amended complaint adding another representative to the class.

{"document": "On March 8, 2006, the Pacific News Service filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the California Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants had violated the constitutional rights of the press and the public to attend, meaningfully observe, and gather and report on important information at executions being carried out by the defendants at the California State Prison at San Quentin. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants' use of pancuronium bromide, a paralytic agent, acted as a chemical curtain over the lethal injection process. The plaintiffs alleged that this chemical made it impossible for witnesses to determine whether the executed inmates were being subjected to substantial and unnecessary pain before dying. As a result, the plaintiffs claimed that the witnesses were denied the information necessary for the public to decide whether and how executions should be conducted.\n\nOn the same day the plaintiffs filed the lawsuit, they asked the court to consolidate their case with Morales v. Woodford (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9823\">CJ-CA-0004</a> in this Clearinghouse). On March 28, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Judge Jeremy Fogel) denied without prejudice the request to consolidate the cases.  \n\nOn October 10, 2010, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim in response to the plaintiffs' second amended complaint. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs did not have a First Amendment right to dictate the method that the state uses to perform a lethal injection execution. Furthermore, the defendants argued that there were legitimate and constitutional reasons for using pancuronium bromide. \n\nOn November 3, 2011, the court entered a scheduling order that included a discovery cut-off date, but the plaintiffs moved to vacate the order and to direct the parties to submit a new proposed schedule \"when viable lethal injection regulations are in place.\" On April 5, 2012 court denied the motion to vacate the scheduling order, reasoning that the ongoing state case, <i>Sims v. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation </i> (CDCR), could affect this case when concluded and therefore the motion was premature. In <i>Sims v. CDCR</i>, the Marin County Superior Court had issued a judgment on February 21, 2012 and held that CDCR failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. The state court had issued an injunction prohibiting CDCR from executing anyone until new lethal injection regulations complied with the APA.\n\nIn July 2012, the parties stipulated that the court should vacate the current scheduling order.

{"document": "On April 20, 2012, a state prisoner filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. The plaintiff sued the California Department of Corrections under §1983 and California state administrative law. Represented by UnCommon Law, he asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that officials of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and its Board of Parole Hearings, acted unfairly by refusing to authentically consider the appropriateness of parole for prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment. \n\nOn October 18, 2012, Magistrate Judge Gregory G. Hollows granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, but allowed the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 28 days. 2012 WL 5187779. On November 15, 2012, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging with more detail that officials of the State of California--including the Governor, the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), and various officials of the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH)--implemented a system to fabricate evidence to support their decisions to deny parole, particularly for inmates serving a life sentence (\"Lifers\"), and that this discriminatory scheme was used to protect their decisions from judicial scrutiny so that they could maintain the low rate of granting parole to Lifers. \n\nOn March 31, 2014, U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification of a class consisting \"of California state prisoners who are serving life sentences and are eligible.\" Judge Mueller also granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs' equal protection and state law claims, but denied the defendants' summary judgment motion as to the plaintiffs' due process claims. 2014 WL 1309289. The defendants appealed this decision but their petition for permission to appeal was denied on June 12, 2014. \n\nOn September 26, 2014, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Magistrate Judge Claire recommended be denied in part and granted in part. Though the defendants objected to the magistrate's findings and recommendations, they were adopted by the District Court in a May 14, 2015 order. 2015 WL 2358583. As a result, the defendants got judgment on counts four (alleging \"that their Due Process rights ha[d] been violated by the denial of 'notice of the evidence being used to consider their suitability for parole.'\"), five (alleging \"that the refusal to provide access to the data underlying the FAD reports also deprive[d] them of their Due Process right to be heard at their parole hearings\"), nine (alleging \"that they ha[d] a 'limited' Due Process right to 'confront and cross examine [the] putative experts' whose FAD reports [were] used to deny plaintiffs parole\"), and twelve (alleging \"that they ha[d] a Due Process right to call witnesses, including adverse witnesses, at their parole hearings\") of the plaintiff's complaint. The Court allowed the plaintiffs to, within 30 days, file an amended complaint as to the remaining counts. The plaintiff decided against amending a complaint. \n\nIn a joint status report filed on July 17, 2015, the parties indicated that they had entered into negotiations and were working toward a settlement. On October 2, 2015, the parties entered into a finalized stipulation and settlement agreement, which required reforms in the psychological risk assessment process used by the parole board, including an opportunity for Lifers to challenge factual errors in risk assessments through counsel. The defendants also agreed to consult experts on the use of risk assessments in the correctional setting and make information presented by the Board of Parole Hearing's Psychologist available to the plaintiffs and be posted online. Furthermore, the Court was to retain jurisdiction over this case until January 1, 2017. If within 30 days after January 1, 2017, the plaintiffs believed that the defendants had not abided by the terms of the settlement, the plaintiffs could seek an extension of the Court's jurisdiction over this matter for no more than 12 months. \n\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, once the Agreement was approved, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed all but one of the defendants--the Executive Officer of the Board of Parole Hearings. The plaintiffs' motion to do so was granted in an order by Magistrate Judge Claire on June 24, 2016.\n\nThe issue of attorneys fees was raised in a separate motion on October 16, 2015, which was referred to Magistrate Judge Claire. On November 10, 2015, she granted the plaintiff's motion for attorneys fees, and the defendants had 30 days to pay $119,796.05 to the plaintiff. The defendants challenged this order, filing a motion for Reconsideration of Timing of Fee and Cost Payment. On December 1, 2015, Magistrate Judge Claire granted the defendant's request for reconsideration and edited the last sentence of the court's order to read: \"Defendants shall remit payment to Plaintiffs' counsel in the amount of $119,796.05, within thirty (30) days after the Court grants final approval of the parties Amended Stipulated Settlement, subject to interest thereafter as provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1961.\"\n\nOn October 6, 2017, the court extended its jurisdiction for another year, finding that the defendants had not complied fully with the Settlement.

As Doraville’s City Council heavily relied on these revenues to balance the city’s budget, its municipal court personnel, who serve at the pleasure of the City Council, had a financial incentive to convict defendants. In addition, the city’s law enforcement personnel, who also ultimately serve at the pleasure of its City Council, had an incentive to ticket and prosecute to raise revenue. \n\nOn May 23, 2018, four individuals who had been ticketed or threatened to be ticketed by the City of Doraville filed this lawsuit in U.S. District Court Northern District of Georgia. The case was assigned to Judge Richard W. Story. Represented by Strickland Brockington Lewis, LLP, and the Institute for Justice, the plaintiffs sued the City of Doraville under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and the Declaratory Judgments Act. The plaintiffs alleged that the City’s policy and practice of using its law enforcement and municipal court system for revenue generation violated the plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, the complaint claimed that the “financial incentive to ticket and prosecute injects an unconstitutional financial bias or an appearance of such bias into law enforcement and prosecutorial discretion.” The plaintiffs sought declarative and injunctive relief from Doraville’s policy and practice of budgeting to receive revenues from fines and fees. \n\nThe defendant sought to dismiss the complaint on July 2, 2018, claiming that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and the complaint failed to state a claim as a matter of law. On April 1, 2019, the court (Judge Richard Story) denied in part the motion to dismiss. The court found that the plaintiffs successfully alleged standing, as the complaint is replete with allegations showing that plaintiffs were personally harmed, and are likely to be harmed in the future, from the city’s allegedly unlawful actions. Regarding the complaint’s failure to state a claim as a matter of law, the court found itself “unable to adequately assess whether Plaintiffs’ claims are legally cognizable...as a result of the paucity of relevant case law.” As such, the court ordered a hearing to address the proper standard of review and its application in this case. 2019 WL 3557893. This hearing was held on June 4, 2019. \n\nAfter reconsidering the motion to dismiss, the court denied the motion on July 9, 2019.

{"document": "On May 22, 2012, several national and local news agencies filed a § 1983 lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, Southern Division, against the state of Idaho. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the policy of the Idaho Department of Correction to prohibit public viewing of the preparatory phase of the execution process, during which the inmate is restrained and the IV is inserted, violates the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.\n\nAlong with their complaint, plaintiffs filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to have the procedures in question enjoined before the execution of Richard Leavitt on June 12. The District Court (Judge Edward J. Lodge) granted the motion to expedite on May 24, but on June 5 the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Lodge found that while the plaintiffs have a strong case on the merits and the public has an interest in viewing an execution in its entirety, the motion was not filed in a timely manner, and to allow it would disrupt a scheduled execution that the public has an even greater interest in seeing carried out.\n\nPlaintiffs immediately filed an interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit. On June 8, 2012, the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court. A three-judge panel (Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, Judge Stephen R. Reinhardt, and Judge Marsha S. Berzon) stated in an opinion by Judge Reinhardt that its ruling in California First Amendment Coalition v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 868 (9th Cir. 2002), had clearly indicated that Idaho's policy was unconstitutional for the reasons noted by the plaintiffs, that Idaho had had a decade to correct this policy, and thus that any problems of timing were the fault of the state and not of the plaintiffs. It further found that the District Court had abused its discretion in balancing the four elements the plaintiff must prove for a preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the appeals panel reversed the District Court and remanded for entry of an injunction prior to the execution of Richard Leavitt.\n\nThe District Court (Judge Lodge) entered an injunction on June 11 and directed the parties to submit a joint litigation plan by June 22. \n\nOn July 10, 2012, Judge Lodge entered a permanent injunction ordering the Idaho Department of Corrections, and responsible parties associated therewith, to modify their procedures to allow the witnesses to the execution of a condemned inmate to observe the entire execution from the moment the inmate enters the execution chamber through, to and including, the time the inmate is declared dead. \n\nThe case is now closed.\n\n\n", "summary": "On May 22, 2012, several national and local news agencies filed a § 1983 lawsuit against the state of Idaho, alleging that the policy of the Idaho Department of Correction to prohibit public viewing of the preparatory phase of the execution process, during which the inmate is restrained and the IV is inserted, violates the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.

{"document": "On December 12, 2016, seven prisoners in the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs sued the State of Illinois and its attorney general under 42 U.S.C. §1983.  Represented by private counsel, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Illinois, by its policies regarding individuals convicted of sex-related offenses, had violated their rights under the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments.  The case was assigned to Judge Virginia M. Kendall.\n\nIndividuals convicted of certain sex-related offenses under Illinois law are subject to overlapping statutory and regulatory schemes that make it difficult for prisoners to satisfy conditions required for their release from prison. The Illinois Unified Code of Corrections provides that for all felony convictions, the sentencing court must provide within the sentencing order a term of parole or mandatory supervised release (MSR). Individuals convicted after July 1, 2005 of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual criminal assault, or criminal sexual assault, and individuals convicted after January 1, 2009 of aggravated child pornography or manufacturing or dissemination of child pornography were subject to a mandatory indeterminate term of MSR. The indeterminate duration of MSR could range from three years to life: an individual could only apply for termination of his indeterminate MSR sentence after completing three years of MSR outside of prison. A prisoner could not receive credit for MSR time served while in custody.\n\nThe Prison Review Board (PRB) required that before inmates could be released from IDOC custody, they had to have an approved “host site” to reside at while serving their MSR term.  IDOC only approved host sites that met all housing restrictions imposed by statute, by IDOC, and by the Prison Review Board.  Illinois did not provide housing resources for inmates, and halfway homes and homeless shelters automatically rejected individuals with sex-related convictions. Each plaintiff had either submitted multiple host sites and been denied by the IDOC, or was indigent and had no housing options to select for their host site. The plaintiffs alleged that the multiple restrictions created an unmeetable condition that forced them to spend the duration of their MSR term incarcerated. For the plaintiffs that were given an indeterminate MSR sentence, the unmeetable conditions resulted in life imprisonment. \n\t\nOn February 17, 2017, IDOC moved to dismiss the complaint on three grounds:<ol><li>Two of the plaintiffs’ claims lacked standing because they had not yet completed their incarceration sentences; <li>The plaintiffs’ claim against the duration of their confinement should have been raised as a habeas action, not under 42 U.S.C. §1983; and <li>The plaintiffs’ claims failed to allege sufficient facts for their constitutional claims.</ol>On August 18, 2017, the court granted in part IDOC’s motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs did not need to file a habeas action in order to receive the requested relief, and that all constitutional claims were appropriate except for the due process claim.  The court granted, however, IDOC’s motion to dismiss with respect to two plaintiffs because their claims were based on post-release conditions and the plaintiffs had not yet been released. She further granted the motion with respect to the plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim because of vagueness.\n\nOn December 6, 2017,  the plaintiffs moved for class certification and appointment of class counsel. They sought to certify a class of inmates who had completed their sentenced term and were currently detained in the IDOC and denied release because of their inability to find an approved host site.  The court approved the unopposed motion on April 6, 2018, defining the class as all individuals sentenced to serve “three-years-to-life” on MSR, currently detained in IDOC, who have been approved for release on MSR but have been denied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an approved host site. Once discovery ended, both parties sought summary judgment. On March 31, 2019, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment in part and denied IDOC’s cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\nThe court held that the state’s host site requirement resulted in the continued deprivation of the plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights. The court also addressed whether the proper vehicle to bring the plaintiffs’ claims was 42 U.S.C. §1983 or a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and determined that the plaintiffs properly brought their claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983 because they were not seeking release from custody, but rather the proper application of law to their situation. The court found that there was a genuine issue material fact as to whether IDOC offered a procedure for determining the validity of a decision to deny a host site, and denied summary judgment on that claim.\n\nBoth parties met on May 1, 2019, for a settlement conference and held further status hearings on June 18, 2019, October 1, 2019, December 3, 2019, January 2, 2020.\n\nOn January 15, 2020, the court granted a permanent injunction. According to the order, IDOC was required to present a plan, as well as quarterly reports outlining steps that would be taken to ensure that by January 2, 2021, no class member would remain in IDOC custody due to an inability to locate a host site. \n\nOn January 29, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a bill of costs, and on February 18, 2020, the court awarded costs to the plaintiffs in the amount of $3,015.41.\n\nOn February 27, 2020, IDOC presented a compliance plan to the court, pursuant to the injunction.  The plan outlined the steps that IDOC had already taken to assist class members, such as host site policy changes and a review of host site denials.  It also outlined additional steps that IDOC was then undertaking to release class members, such as finalizing a Request for Proposal for licensed transitional housing locations for sex offenders, and cooperation with the Illinois Department of Human Services to identify appropriate placements and/or services for class members who would likely qualify for that department’s services upon their release.\n\nOn June 15, 2020, IDOC presented a quarterly report further outlining the steps that it was then taking to release class members. \n\nAs of July 2020, the court’s supervision of the settlement is ongoing.\n", "summary": "In 2016, prisoners that had completed their sentences but remained incarcerated by the Illinois Department of Corrections filed this class action against the state in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

The plaintiff sued Dodge City and Ford County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff alleged that the Dodge City's wealth-based post-arrest detention scheme violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and a declaratory judgment that the City's wealth-based detention practices were unlawful.  \n\nThe plaintiff, a Native American citizen of Dodge City, was arrested and held at the Ford County Jail because he could not pay $250 to the City of Dodge City. In Dodge City, arrestees faced two different outcomes depending on their wealth status: Wealthy arrestees paid an amount set by the bail schedule and were not held in jail, while poor arrestees were put in jail for 48 hours because they could not afford to pay the City's pre-determined bail for their offense. Bail amounts ranged from $250-$2500. Under the City's scheme, the sole criterion for determining whether a pretrial arrestee walked free or sat in jail was the amount of money that he had. The plaintiff alleged that this policy and practice of using a fixed \"bail schedule\" to determine the amount of money necessary to secure post-arrest release and the practice of requiring cash up-front to avoid post-arrest detention violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.\n\nThe plaintiff sought to certify a class on behalf of himself and all other arrestees unable to pay for their release pursuant to Dodge City's fixed bail schedule who were, are, or who will become in the custody of Dodge City.

James) granted motions to stay all proceedings to allow the parties to explore a non-litigation resolution.\n\nOn April 22, 2016, the parties submitted a joint motion for entry of final declaratory and injunctive relief and joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice. On April 26, 2016, the court (Judge Daniel D.

{"document": "On November 30, 2015, a resident of Clark County, Kentucky, who was arrested and admitted to jail filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky against the Clark County Detention Center (Jail). The complaint alleged that the Jail wrongly deprived the plaintiffs of property without due process of law and charged costs of their incarceration absent court order, including for plaintiffs who were subsequently acquitted. The complaint alleged that this violated Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) §441.265, and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel. \n\nThe individual plaintiff who filed the suit had been arrested and admitted to the Jail on October 26, 2013; he remained incarcerated until his release on December 15, 2014. Plaintiff maintained that the criminal charges for which he was incarcerated were dismissed midway on April 2, 2015, because the plaintiff proved he was entirely innocent of such offenses. After release, plaintiff received a written demand from the Jail to pay in excess of $4,000 in fees relating to his incarceration. As of November 30, 2015, the plaintiff paid $20 and refused to pay the remaining balance on the grounds that KRS §441.265 allowed a jail to charge detainees the costs of their confinement only with a court order and consideration of the detainee's financial obligations. Moreover, the plaintiff alleged, the jail could not charge innocent detainees and was required to accounting for the funds collected. The plaintiff further maintained that if KRS §441.265 is interpreted otherwise, then it violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the Kentucky Constitution. \n\nThe plaintiff sought both compensatory and punitive damages arising from the conduct of the defendants, and declaratory judgment and permanent injunction of the practice. \n\nOn January 14, 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's claims.

Judge Hood found, moreover, that the facts pleaded did not rise to the level of a substantive due process violation and that the state had a legitimate interest in recouping costs from inmates.

{"document": "On August 7, 2017, two residents of East Baton Rouge Parish filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued East Baton Rouge Parish and Rehabilitation Home Incarceration (RHI) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), and state law. The case was assigned to Judge Shelly D. Dick. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center, sought monetary relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had violated federal and state anti-racketeering law, Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. \n\nAccording to the plaintiffs, RHI purported to provide pretrial supervision services and profited from individuals in East Baton Rouge Parish by requiring them to pay hundreds of dollars to RHI to be released from jail, effectively holding them for ransom. People awaiting trial before a criminal court were coerced into paying hundreds of dollars to companies before and after they were released from jail, even after paying bail. The complaint alleged that RHI turned pre-trial release into a for-profit concern that fueled wealth-based incarceration, harming low-income people who had not been convicted of a crime. \n\n The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding the Sheriff of East Baton Rouge as a defendant on August 8, 2017. A few days later the plaintiffs filed a notice voluntarily dismissing East Baton Rouge Parish as a defendant. On September 27, 2017, the court approved the dismissal.\n\nOn October 27, 2017, the Sheriff of East Baton Rouge Parish filed a motion to dismiss all claims against him for failure to state a claim, arguing that even if the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights were violated, the alleged policy of the sheriff was not the “moving force” behind the alleged violations. In February 2018, RHI and its executive director also filed a motion to dismiss with similar arguments.\n\nOn June 5, 2018, Judge Dick granted the Sheriff’s motion to dismiss, finding that there was no plausible basis to support the conclusory allegations that the Sheriff was “in agreement” or part of a “scheme” with RHI. 2018 WL 2708752. Judge Dick also dismissed RHI's motion to dismiss on September 12, 2018, claiming, among other things, that Defendants utterly failed to brief the elements of both the federal and state RICO claims and failed to argue how the Complaint fails to state a claim, and the facts asserted in the complaint plausibly plead that RHI was the moving force behind the alleged constitutional violation. 2018 WL 4355199\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on June 12, 2019. This complaint replaced an individual plaintiff with another individual plaintiff and removed the Sheriff of East Baton Rouge Parish as a defendant. \n\nOn July 2, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, claiming, among other things, that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \n\nThe parties reached a settlement agreement-in-principle and notified the court on Dec 5, 2019 that they are currently finalizing the final written settlement agreement to conclude this matter.

{"document": "On September 17, 2015, indigent former criminal defendants filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued the City of New Orleans, the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (OPCDC), the court’s judges, judicial administrators, and the city’s sheriff department, all under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Civil Rights Corps and private counsel, sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, claiming violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had a practice of imprisoning individuals who had failed to pay court debts without meaningfully determining whether the individuals had the ability to pay the debt. Moreover, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants issued unlawful warrants for their arrest and illegally kept them imprisoned. \n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the sheriff from the lawsuit on October 3, 2015, and later on November, 2, 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss several of individual defendants from the lawsuit. The defendants argued three points: first, that there was a lack of jurisdiction to retain the defendants in this lawsuit, second, that the plaintiff did not join indispensable parties to the lawsuit, and third, that the judicial defendants enjoyed qualified immunity. On April 21, 2016, Judge Sarah Vance denied the defendants request to dismiss the defendants on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and failure to join indispensable parties. 186 F.Supp.3d 536.\n\nOn May 3, 2016, Judge Vance granted in part and denied in part the defendants' request to dismiss the judicial defendants on the grounds that they enjoyed absolute and qualified immunity. On May 11, 2016, the court dismissed the judicial administrator along with several other defendants from the lawsuit. However, the court still allowed the plaintiffs to seek declaratory relief. 184 F.Supp.3d 349. The parties began settlement negotiations.\n\nOn December 13, 2017, Judge Vance granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The Court found that (1) judges had a policy/practice of failing to conduct any inquiry into plaintiffs’ ability to pay court debts before plaintiffs are imprisoned for non-payment; (2) this failure to inquire violated due process; (3) judges’ control over both fines and fees revenue and ability-to-pay determinations violated due process; and (4) judges faced a substantial conflict of interest when they were determining the ability to pay fines and fees.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, the plaintiffs and the Orleans Parish Sheriff reached a compromise about two related civil actions, and so the court ordered partial dismissal without costs and without prejudice to the right to reopen those actions, retaining jurisdiction to enforce that settlement if it was not consummated within 60 days. \n\nOn August 2, 2018, Judge Vance granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification as all persons who owe or will incur court debts arising from cases adjudicated in OPCDC, with the subclass of all members whose debts are at least partly owed to the OPCDC Judicial Expense Fund. On August 3, 2018, the court filed a declaratory judgment, holding that the Judges’ policy or practice of not inquiring into the ability of the persons falling within the certified class to pay before they are imprisoned for non-payment of court debts was unconstitutional, and that the Judges’ failure to provide a neutral forum for determination of such persons’ ability to pay was also unconstitutional. The court invoked the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits a state actor from arresting or detaining a criminal defendant solely for failure to pay a court-imposed debt absent a determination of ability to pay, and which also requires a state court to provide a neutral forum in which to adjudicate ability to pay. 2018 WL 3657447.\n\nOn August 21, 2018, the defendants appealed to Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court on August 23, 2019. 937 F.3d 446.

The defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court on December 20, 2019. Cert was denied on March 3, 2020. \n\nMeanwhile, back in the district court, the plaintiffs moved the court for supplemental relief on February 25, 2019. The plaintiffs argued that a more specific declaratory judgment was appropriate and asked the court to decree it unconstitutional for any Orleans Parish Criminal District Court debtor to be imprisoned for willful nonpayment absent (1) a meaningful inquiry into the debtor’s ability to pay, preceded by notice of the importance of that issue and including an opportunity for the debtor to be heard on it, and (2) a finding that the debtor is able to pay. The defendants filed an opposition motion on March 19.

{"document": "On November 11, 2019, a pretrial detainee filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana alleging that twelve judges of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (\"OPCDC\") unlawfully imposed secured financial conditions of release in an amount that individuals cannot afford, without any inquiry into or findings concerning their ability to pay or alternatives to incarceration. The lawsuit was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201– 02 alleging violations of the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and seeking declaratory relief. The Plaintiff, represented by the MacArthur Justice Center and Civil Rights Corps, sued on behalf of a putative class consisting of all individuals with pending state misdemeanor or felony cases who would, after acceptance of their charges by the District Attorney, appear before the Defendant Judges for proceedings concerning pretrial release. \n\nThe complaint alleged that the Defendant judges’ imposition of bail without inquiring whether the arrestee could pay it constituted de facto orders of pretrial detention for those unable to pay. This constitutional violation was allegedly incentivized by the Defendants’ institutional financial conflict of interest. If (and only if) an arrestee uses a commercial surety to secure pretrial release, the OPCDC judges receive 0.8% of the amount of that bond that goes into a general fund used to pay a variety of expenses related to the judiciary. The Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on December 20 which added one more Plaintiff to represent the class.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Greg Gerard Guidry, but after he recused himself it was reassigned to Judge Carl Barbier.

The Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs’ claim was not redressible because the court cannot eliminate the Judges’ roles as both adjudicators of criminal matters and administrators of the general fund.

The defendants filed a second motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on March 31.\n\nA hearing was held on May 27, 2020 regarding Plaintiffs’ motion to certify the class and both of Defendants’ motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

On August 21, Judge Fallon denied the Plaintiffs' motion to certify, finding that there was not sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Defendant-judges acted in a uniform manner. Judge Fallon noted that the Plaintiffs could seek certification again after engaging in discovery. In the same order, Judge Fallon also denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss as the Court declined to determine whether the Plaintiffs had standing before deciding the class certification question. 2020 WL 4923626.

{"document": "COVID Summary: This is a class action suit regarding the legality of detention orders that are holding detainees at East Baton Rouge Parish Prison for up to years and detrimental to life during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on December 14, 2020, but withdrew the request for a temporary restraining order in January 2021. A settlement conference is scheduled for March 11, and a joint status report is due on March 21. This case is ongoing. <hr>\n\nOn December 14, 2020, four individuals who were being held at East Baton Rouge Parish Prison (EBRPP) filed this class action lawsuit against 5 officials of the 19th Judicial District Courthouse, the sheriff, and the warden of EBRPP in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued for violations of their Fourteenth and Sixth Amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by the MacArthur Justice Center, Advancement Project, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, release of class members, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick and Magistrate Judge Scott D. Johnson.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that hundreds of individuals, most of whom were poor and black, were confined at EBRPP for up to years as a result of the defendant judicial officials' actions. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants ignored the detainees' likelihood to appear at trial, risk of danger to the community, and ability to pay monetary conditions of release, which violated the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants ignored procedural protections, including failing to provide the detainees notice of hearing, opportunity to present evidence, and assistance to counsel prior to issuing pretrial detention orders, which violated due process. Additionally, they alleged that the defendants denied plaintiffs' counsel to make substantive arguments prior to issuing detention orders in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Lastly, the plaintiffs noted that EBRPP 's dilapidated conditions and history of poor medical care placed the detainees at an increased risk of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn December 14, 2020, the plaintiffs moved to proceed anonymously and for certification of the proposed class of \"all individuals who are in the custody of the East baton Rouge Sheriff's office after their arrest and who have been or will be subjected to the bail practices of the Judges and Commissioners of the 19th Judicial District Court.\" The following day, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the defendant sheriff and warden. The plaintiffs requested release of the named plaintiffs and for the court to enjoin the defendant sheriff and warden from detaining individuals whose bail conditions were determined at hearings that violated due process and equal protection. The plaintiffs filed declarations from *** pretrial detainees, some of whom have illnesses that make them vulnerable to COVID-19, have had arraignments delayed due to COVID-19, or cite inappropriate social distancing or hygiene practices.\n\nOn December 17, the plaintiffs moved for expedited discovery and on January 12, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an emergency second motion for expedited discovery and request for status conference. The court granted the motion in part and scheduled a status conference to discuss the plaintiffs' discovery request. At the January 14 conference, the court denied the plaintiff's first motion for expedited discovery as moot and granted in part the emergency second motion. The parties agreed to the scope of expedited discovery and set a discovery deadline of January 20, 2021. \n\nOn January 17, the plaintiffs moved to withdraw the request for temporary restraining order, which was granted on January 19. The plaintiffs then filed a joint motion to continue hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction, which was granted on January 21 and set a deadline of March 21 for the parties to file a joint status report. \n\nThe case remains ongoing with a settlement conference was scheduled for March 11, and with the defendants' responsive pleading to the complaint due on March 22, 2021.

{"document": "On January 19, 2006, a death-sentenced inmate of the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center in Baltimore, Maryland filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Maryland Department of Correction in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  The plaintiff, whose execution was scheduled to take place during the week of February 6, 2006, sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from carrying out his execution using their current practices and procedures for lethal injection.  The plaintiff's specific objection was to the three-drug cocktail (sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in Maryland's lethal injections.  He alleged that particular skill was required to properly administer sodium pentothal, which was intended to induce general anesthesia, and that improper administration of the drug would lead to excruciating, torturous pain during the administration of the other two drugs.  Due to this, the plaintiff argued that the defendants' lethal injection procedures arbitrarily and unnecessarily created a grave risk that he would suffer extreme pain during his execution, thus violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n\nThe next day, the plaintiff filed a similar complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, naming as co-plaintiffs the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Maryland (ACLU), and the Maryland Citizens Against State Executions (MCASE).  In this complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had failed to follow Maryland law (Md. Code Ann., State Gov't §3-905) in adopting their execution protocol because it had not been formally adopted under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA), thereby depriving the state's citizens of the opportunity to ensure that executions were carried out in a proper and humane manner and increasing the risk that the executed prisoners would suffer unnecessarily during their executions.  They asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and to enjoin the defendants from performing any executions until they had come into compliance with the law.  \n\nOn February 1, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Judge Benson Everett Legg) denied both the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order and his motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that Maryland's three-drug protocol did not endanger the plaintiff's constitutional rights.  The court reasoned that thirty-five of the thirty-seven states who used lethal injection as a means of execution used the same protocol as Maryland, and that the Fourth Circuit had already ruled that this protocol did not run afoul of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.  \n\nThe plaintiff appealed the following day, asking the District Court to stay the execution pending the outcome of the appeal.  On the same day, the District Court (Judge Legg) denied the request to stay the execution.  On February 3, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Judge James Harvie Wilkinson III) denied without opinion the plaintiff's motion for an injunction pending appeal.  \n\nOn February 13, the plaintiff asked the Fourth Circuit to dismiss the appeal, and on February 15, 2006, the Fourth Circuit (Judge Wilkinson) granted that motion.  \n\nFrom September 19-22, 2006, the U.S. District Court held an evidentiary hearing, and both sides filed motions for summary judgment.  On December 1, 2006, the District Court ordered the defendants to explore the potential availability of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and certified registered nurse anesthetists to assist in the execution.  On December 7, 2006, the Court ordered the defendants to submit a written plan describing the parameters of a proposed search.  \n\nMeanwhile, on December 19, 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals invalidated the Maryland execution protocols until such time as they were properly adopted under the MAPA or exempted from that requirement by an act of the Maryland General Assembly.  The court enjoined the defendants from utilizing its current lethal injection protocol and checklist until one of these two events occurred.  Evans v. Saar, 396 Md. 256 (Md. Ct. App. 2006).\n\nOn January 29, 2007, Senate Bill 239 was introduced in the Maryland General Assembly and assigned to committee.  If adopted that bill would exempt the death penalty protocols from the requirements of the MAPA.  On the same day, House Bill 225 was introduced in the Maryland General Assembly and assigned to committee.  If adopted, that bill would repeal the death penalty in Maryland.  In light of these rapid changes, the parties issued a joint motion asking the District Court to stay the proceedings in this case until the passage of one of the two proposed bills in the legislature.  On February 21, 2007, the District Court agreed to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the legislation and ordered the parties to file a status report every 90 days.\n\nOn March 14, 2011, the parties filed a joint status report pursuant to the Court's order of February 22, 2007. The status report stated that all executions in Maryland had been stayed until the administrative regulations governing the death penalty process are properly adopted. On August 16, 2012 the Court ordered that the case be administratively closed.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a case challenging the legality of the Small Business Administration's decision to exclude small business owners from parts of the CARES Act, passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 21, the court granted a preliminary injunction extending the deadline to apply for a loan for the named plaintiffs. <hr>\nIn response to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act, which created, among other things, the “Paycheck Protection Program.”  Under this program, small business owners could apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration; if they later certified that all of the loan funds had been used for qualifying expenses, the loan would be forgiven.  The Act authorized the SBA to use a streamlined rulemaking process, in order to distribute the $669 billion fund as quickly as possible.  The SBA’s Interim Final Rules rendered many small business owners with criminal records ineligible; the Interim Final Rules were changed several times between April and June 2020.\n\nOn June 16, 2020, three organizations and two individual plaintiffs filed this lawsuit challenging the legality of the SBA’s decision to exclude small business owners based on their criminal histories.  Represented by the ACLU, the Public Interest Law Center, the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and private counsel, they sued the Small Business Administration in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  Their complaint alleged that the SBA had no statutory authority under the CARES Act to add the criminal record exclusions; that the exclusions were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; that the exclusions had a disparate impact on communities of color; and that the multiple changes to the Interim Final Rules had made it impossible for some qualifying small business owners to apply before the June 30 application deadline.  The case was assigned to Judge Catherine C. Blake.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring unlawful and setting aside the SBA’s rulemaking action.  They also sought an injunction that would:<ol><li> bar the SBA from denying Paycheck Protection Program funds to applicants because of their criminal records,<li>compel the SBA to extend the application deadline three weeks (to July 21, 2020) in all of the states where the plaintiffs operated (Maryland, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, and Washington), and <li>reserve sufficient funds ($31,500) to fill the plaintiffs’ loan requests.</ol>They also sought attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nThe SBA issued a new set of rules on June 24, which made all of the plaintiffs eligible to apply for loans.  However, in a June 29, 2020 ruling, the court declined to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims as moot.  The SBA had not demonstrated that the plaintiffs would not again be excluded from loan consideration; additionally, the SBA had not granted the requested deadline extension.  In that decision, the court found that the June 24 Interim Final Rule was a permissible interpretation of SBA’s statutory authority under the CARES Act.  The plaintiffs were thus unlikely to prevail on their claims that the June 24 Interim Final Rule was arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law.  The court found, however, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their arbitrary-and-capricious claims regarding the earlier incarnations of the Interim Final Rule; for that reason, the court granted a preliminary injunction ordering the deadline extended to July 21 for the named plaintiffs, but declined to issue any other requested relief.\n\nOn July 4, 2020, President Trump signed follow-up legislation that gave all business owners eligible under the June 24 Interim Final Rule until August 8, 2020 to apply.\n\nAs of July 29, 2020, further developments in the litigation are pending.", "summary": "In response to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act, which created, among other things, the “Paycheck Protection Program.”  Under this program, small business owners could apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration; if they later certified that all of the loan funds had been used for qualifying expenses, the loan would be forgiven.  \r\n\r\nThe SBA’s rules disqualified many small business owners with criminal records.

{"document": "On February 8, 2015, persons jailed for failing to pay fines imposed by the City of Ferguson that they could not afford filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. They made a number of allegations against Ferguson, including: (1) that the City failed to conduct an inquiry into whether plaintiffs were able to pay their fines before jailing them, in violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) that the City failed to provide plaintiffs with legal counsel during the proceedings leading to their incarceration, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments; (3) that the City jailed plaintiffs indefinitely and without an adequate legal process through which they could challenge their detention, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (4) that the squalid and unhealthy conditions of Ferguson's jail constituted Cruel and Unusual Punishment, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; (5) that the City used jail time and the threat of jail time to deny plaintiffs the substantive and procedural protections that Missouri debtors would have against private creditors, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (6) that the City issued arrest warrants against impoverished persons for failure to pay traffic fines without any finding of probable cause, in violation the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; and (7) that the City detained plaintiffs arrested without a valid warrant for an extended period without a legitimate government interest, in violation the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n \nRepresented by ArchCity Defenders, the Civil Rights Corps, Equal Justice Under Law, lawyers from St. Louis University School of Law, and private counsel including White & Case LLP, the plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201. They sought class action certification, declaratory relief, injunctive relief requiring Ferguson to change its practices and policies to stop violating the U.S. Constitution, damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Audrey G. Fleissig.\n\nOn May 26, 2015, the court granted defendant's motion to dismiss in part, dismissing plaintiffs’ claims (5) and (6). 2015 WL 3417420. However, on July 13, 2015, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, reversing the May 26 order. 2015 WL 4232917.\n\nOn January 29, 2016, the parties were told to select neutral parties to act as mediators and to schedule mediation to see if they could come to a settlement agreement. On May 10, 2016, the neutral parties reported that though they had mediated in good faith, they were unable to reach a settlement. \n\nOn April 13, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint. The defendant subsequently filed a partial motion to dismiss two weeks later in response. The plaintiffs in July filed a motion with the court to compel production of emails from the defendant in support of its claim that the City of Ferguson engaged in a \"widespread scheme\" of jailing individuals who could not afford small debts. While the motion to dismiss the amended complaint was denied in November, the court subsequently granted the defendant's claim of privilege on the documents and held a hearing on that issue. The motion to compel documents was eventually granted in part and denied in part to the extent that plaintiffs sufficiently narrowed search terms for the electronic documents. The case proceeded through discovery in 2017.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class certification again in June 2017 and simultaneously moved to disqualify defendant's counsel due to a conflict of interest. In August, the court granted the motion to disqualify counsel and extended a stay on the issue of class certification. According to <a href=https://www.propublica.org/article/a-lawsuit-over-ferguson-debtors-prison-drags-on>ProPublica</a>, the firm was disqualified because it had hired a lawyer who had previously represented one of the plaintiffs while working for ArchCity Defenders. The court denied class certification on January 29, 2018 without prejudice to refiling.\n\nOnce the defendant obtained replacement counsel in September, it moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on Counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 due to sovereign immunity. This further stayed proceedings until resolution on the issue on February 13, 2018, when the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. 2018 WL 10245936. On February 15, the defendant filed an interlocutory appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals of the decision against sovereign immunity.\n\nSubsequently, the defendant moved to stay proceedings pending appeal. The plaintiffs had opposed the motion to stay, claiming that there was no ruling for the defendant to appeal. The original trial date in April was vacated. On March 12, 2018, the court granted the stay. The case was administratively closed until resolution of the interlocutory appeal. On January 10, 2019, the Eighth Circuit (Judges Steven Colloton, Raymond Gruender, and L. Steven Grasz) dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court explained that the City was not itself entitled to sovereign immunity and could not invoke the state's sovereign immunity to justify dismissing the suit. 913 F.3d 757. The district court lifted the stay and litigation resumed. \n\nThe defendant filed a motion to dismiss counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 on March 5, 2020. After briefing, the court denied this motion in full on August 6, 2019. The court found that, contrary to the defendant's arguments, the state municipal court was not a required party whose absence (here due to sovereign immunity) required dismissal. 2019 WL 3577529. Later that month, on August 28, the defendant appealed this order to the Eighth Circuit. The defendant filed a motion to stay proceedings pending appeal the following day. The district court denied this motion on September 19, 2019, and discovery continued.

{"document": "On May 27, 2015, this lawsuit was brought in the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri by a person arrested by the City of St. Ann (the City), Missouri, who was jailed for a prolonged period after he was unable to pay the fee demanded for his release under the city’s “secured bail” policy. Under that policy, persons arrested for ordinance violations were required to post a bail from $150-350 or spend upwards of 3 days in jail, without any consideration of the person’s ability to pay. The plaintiff argued that the City’s policy violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Represented by public interest organizations ArchCity Defenders and Equal Justice Under Law, the plaintiff brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff asked the court for class certification to represent other similarly situated individuals, for a declaration that the City had violated the constitutional rights of arrestees who were unable to pay the City’s secured bail, for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the City to stop jailing arrestees for their inability to pay the City’s secured bail, for damages to the named plaintiff to compensate for his period of confinement, and for legal costs and attorneys’ fees. \n\nThat same day, plaintiffs moved for class certification for the proposed class: \"all arrestees unable to pay for their release pursuant to St. Ann's fixed bail schedule who are or will become in the custody of St. Ann.\"\n\nThe next day, the parties asked the judge assigned to the case, Judge Rodney W. Sippel, to grant them a stay in proceedings so that they could conduct settlement negotiations. To that end, plaintiffs dropped their request for preliminary injunctive relief pending the outcome of the negotiations. The day after that, on May 29, 2015, Judge Sippel granted a stay, and asked the parties to report the outcome of the negotiations to him by August 3, 2015. \n\nOn September 2, 2015, Judge Sippel asked the parties, who had failed to meet his August 3 deadline, to show cause for why he shouldn’t dismissed the case with prejudice or issue sanctions. That same day, the parties issued a joint motion showing the judge their provisional settlement agreement, and explaining that they wanted to see how the changes that the agreement required in the City’s policies worked over the coming year. The next day, Judge Sippel agreed to give the parties twelve months to test the effects of the policy changes, and ordered the defendants to comply with the provisional settlement agreement during that period.\n\nUnder the provisional settlement agreement, the plaintiffs agreed to drop most of their non-equitable claims (the claims for monetary damages). The defendants agreed to meet most of plaintiff’s demands for injunctive relief, and to give the named plaintiff a $10,000 fee for acting as a class representative. Namely, the defedants agreed to stop requiring arrestees to post a secured bail for release. Instead, they agreed to release arrestees if they agreed to provide an unsecured bond (a bond which requires persons to pay the court only if they fail to adhere to the conditions of their bail) or a recognizance (an alternative set of conditions for preventing persons from violating the terms of their bail to the payment of a monetary fee), except for cases in which the arrestee was a threat and detention was required to protect the community. The defendants also agreed to improve their procedures for notifying arrestees of their court dates, and to release persons arrested for failure to attend court dates on unsecured bonds. \n\nThe parties agreed that the plaintiff and their counsel would notify defendants of any perceived breach in the agreement, and that the plaintiff and their counsel reserved the right to pursue judgment against defendants if they failed to remedy the breach. The parties also reserved the right to seek modification of the agreement, and if they fail to reach an agreement on modification, to terminate the agreement and resume litigation. \n\nOn June 5, 2017, Judge Sippel ordered the parties to show cause for why their respective cases should not be dismissed. He noted that both parties had failed to file official settlement documents by the required date he had set. Both parties responded, and a status conference was set. \n\nA consent judgment was filed by the defendant and signed on May 4, 2018 by Judge Sippel. In the consent judgement, the defendant specifically agreed to (1) not utilize secured money bail for persons in the custody of the Defendant on arrest; (2) offer any arrested person release from the custody of the Defendant on recognizance or on an unsecured bond as soon as practicable after booking (with the only exception are persons charged with assault, or if release would pose a danger to the community); (3) notify all arrestees in writing upon release from custody when and where they are required to appear in court; (4) specific procedures in relation to traffic stops; (5) mail a notice of a motion for bond forfeiture, should the released person fail to appear in court; and (6) to take appropriate and lawful steps to convert any unsecured bond into a money judgment at any time after non-appearance. \n\nThe court retained jurisdiction over the consent judgement for two years starting on May 4, 2018. Subsequent to the dissolution of the consent judgment, the defendant agreed to continue to (1) ensure that indigent persons arrested were afforded the necessary protections under the law; and (2) comply with applicable state and federal laws pertaining to the setting of conditions upon pre-trail release from custody. \n\nAs of May 20, 2020, there has been no further action in the docket and the case is presumed to be closed.

Specifically, they claimed that the municipalities imprisoned people for a failure to pay debts owed for minor offenses without inquiring as to their ability to pay in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; failed to provide adequate legal counsel at hearings in which indigent people were imprisoned in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments; incarcerated people indefinitely and without adequate procedural protections in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; sought, issued, and served warrants without probable cause in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; and imposed unduly restrictive methods of debt collection, through incarceration and the threat of incarceration, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 30, 2016. On December 2, 2016, in response to the amended complaint, the court (Judge Rodney W. Sippel) denied the motion to dismiss filed by the defendants.\n\nThe defendants again moved to dismiss on December 14, 2016. On April 24, 2017, Judge Sippel dismissed the claims against all defendant municipalities except the City of St. Ann, finding that the amended complaint failed to state a claim for conspiracy. Judge Sippel ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint against the City of St. Ann and to limit their claims to actions taken by St. Ann. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the conspiracy claim and the dismissal of all other defendants aside from St. Ann, which Judge Sippel denied on July 5, 2017.\n\nOn July 21, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint limited to the actions and policies of the City of St. Ann. On September 8, 2017, the City filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's § 1983 claims for lack of jurisdiction, claiming that the real defendant in interest in the matter was the St. Ann municipal division of the Missouri State Circuit Court, an arm-of-the-state entitled to sovereign immunity. The same day, the City filed a motion to dismiss the remaining count alleging Fourteenth Amendment violations for failure to state a claim. The court denied the defendants' motion on September 14, 2018. \n\nThe court issued an order on October 4, 2018 severing the plaintiff's count relating to conditions of the City of St. Ann's jail. It was then placed on the court's docket as a separate action, and discovery proceeded for the remaining claims. \n\nOn March 16, 2019, defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings for failure to join an indispensable party. Before oral argument on that motion, however, Judge Sippel referred the case to mediation. The parties filed a joint motion to vacate the mediation order on June 19, 2019, but Judge Sippel denied this motion the following day. In a memorandum and order issued on September 3, 2019, the court denied the defendants' motion. 2019 WL 4169215. \n\nAs of April 18, 2020, the mediation deadlines have been extended several times and are currently set to terminate on June 30, 2020.

{"document": "On June 14, 2017, a man awaiting criminal trial and Lexington National Insurance Corporation, a bail bond company, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The case was assigned to Judge Jerome Simandle. The plaintiffs sued the state of New Jersey under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that a New Jersey state law, the Criminal Justice Reform Act (CJRA), violated the bail provision of the Eighth Amendment, due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The CJRA required that pretrial release by monetary bail occur only if a criminal court court found that non-monetary conditions were inadequate. The plaintiffs sought damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief.\n\nOn the same day that the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would enjoin the provisions of the CJRA that they deemed unconstitutional.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, the state filed a brief in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction and moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. The same day, the American Civil Liberties Union, American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, Drug Policy Alliance, Latino Action Network, and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People – New Jersey State Conference jointly moved to participate as amici curiae in support of the defendant. All of these civil rights organizations would be represented by one ACLU lawyer. These prospective amici also filed a brief in opposition to the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn September 21, 2017, the court denied the the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court held that the plaintiffs’ case was unlikely to succeed on the merits and that the plaintiffs were unlikely to suffer irreparable harm without an injunction. Judge Simandle also stated that the accused plaintiff was a bad class representative for a potential class action because the crime that he was on pretrial release for was particularly violent. 277 F. Supp. 3d 707. (Though the plaintiffs had not yet moved for class certification, their complaint indicated that they intended to seek it.)\n\nFour days later, on September 25, 2017, the plaintiffs appealed the court’s decision regarding the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. (Docket Number: 17-03104). In the meantime, the plaintiffs sought to pause litigation in the District Court pending a decision in the Appellate Court. The defendant protested; the Appellate Court’s decision would not affect the District Court’s decision on the merits of the case, so the state wanted to move forward. Still, the District Court granted the stay, holding that the litigation would not continue in the District Court until the Third Circuit had decided the appeal. The District Court therefore terminated the defendant’s motion to dismiss, holding it in abeyance until after the Court of Appeals rendered its decision.\n\nThe Third Circuit heard oral arguments on this case on February 21, 2018. The panel was made up of Judge Thomas L. Ambro, Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo, and Judge Julio M. Fuentes. In an opinion issued on July 9, 2018, they affirmed the district court's denial of preliminary injunction. The opinion held that there is no \"federal constitutional right to deposit money or obtain a corporate surety bond to ensure a criminal defendant's future appearance in court as an equal alternative to non-monetary conditions of pretrial release.\" 895 F.3d 272. \n\nThe plaintiff petitioned for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court on October 1, 2018. His petition was denied on October 29. 139 S.Ct. 440. The plaintiff subsequently dismissed the suit voluntarily, and the case was terminated on October 31, 2018.

{"document": "On May 11, 2011, three individuals given extra-judicial sentences of post-release supervision filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The named defendants were the New York State Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) and the New York State Division of Parole (DOP). They claimed that the defendants administratively assigned sentences of post-release supervision (PRS) and that only a judge could impose an additional sentence under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, class certification, and compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 20, 2011, which added two named plaintiffs to the action, bringing the total to three.\n\nOn November 15, 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on the ground of qualified immunity. On February 10, 2012, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin denied the motion. <i>Bentley v. Dennison</i>, 852 F. Supp. 2d 379 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). The court found that the plaintiffs had made plausible factual allegations that the defendants were responsible for the deprivation of their constitutional rights and that the plaintiffs' rights were clearly established under <i>Earley v. Murray</i>, 451 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2006). The defendants appealed from the denial of their motion to dismiss, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's holding on July 8, 2014. The appeals court held that, under <i>Earley</i>, the administrative imposition PRS terms not imposed by the court was unconstitutional, thus precluding a finding of qualified immunity in this case.  \n\nOn July 16, 2014, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge James C. Francis for settlement purposes. \n\nOn January 28, 2015, Judge Scheindlin granted the plaintiffs' Motion to Certify Class. The court found that the plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of class certification. The class consisted of “all persons who were sentenced to prison in New York State for a fixed term that did not include a term of PRS, but who were nevertheless subjected to PRS after the maximum expiration dates of their determinate sentences and after June 9, 2006.”\n\nOn May 8, 2015, the defendants requested summary judgment. They argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity and that the plaintiffs had failed to establish the personal involvement of certain defendants. The defendants also moved to modify the class to exclude certain class members’ claims that they alleged were barred by statute of limitations, and to exclude class members whose claims they alleged were precluded. Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the question of personal liability for three officers. \n\nOn August 6, 2015, Judge Scheindlin granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion for summary judgment and granted the plaintiffs' partial motion for summary judgment. The court found that since the defendants had failed to make reasonable efforts to comply with precedent that the imposition of post-release supervisory sentences was unconstitutional, they were not entitled to qualified immunity. The court further found that the three individual defendants cited in the plaintiffs' motion could be held personally liable as a matter of law, while the court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the remaining DOP defendants. Regarding the defendants' remaining claims, the court held that the action was not barred by the statute of limitations or collateral estoppel. \n\nThe defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on qualified immunity grounds. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for an order certifying defendants' interlocutory appeal as frivolous. On October 14, 2015, the District Court found that dual jurisdiction was warranted between the District Court and the Court of Appeals because the defendants' renewed qualified immunity claims were frivolous. Thus, the District Court determined that it retained jurisdiction despite the interlocutory appeal.\n\nHowever, on December 16, 2015, the Court of Appeals ordered a stay of proceedings in the District Court pending resolution of the defendants' interlocutory appeal. On September 16, 2016, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of qualified immunity to the defendants. <i>Betances v. Fisher</i>, 837 F.3d 162 (2d Cir. 2016). During this period of time, the case was reassigned to District Judge Deborah A. Batts. \n\nOn May, 30 2018, the parties consented for the rest of the case to be heard by a magistrate judge. The case was then assigned to United States Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger.\n\nFollowing several years of additional discovery and intermittent attempts at settlement discussions, in August 2018 the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and to modify or decertify the class. Specifically, the defendants sought to: (1) dismiss class members whose claims were untimely; (2) dismiss class members who had claims for compensatory damages and award them nominal damages; (3) if the court deemed any class members' damages could be more than nominal, dismiss claims for damages not caused by the defendants; (4) modify the class to exclude plaintiffs if they were referred for resentencings, or limit their damages; (5) decertify the class for purposes of damages; and (6) preclude claims for false imprisonment. \n\nJudge Lehrburger decided the defendants' motions for summary judgment and class certification on February 21, 2019. He denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, except to the extent that it applied to plaintiffs who had sentences of PRS imposed to fix clerical errors by their sentencing courts. Judge Lehrburger barred these plaintiffs from receiving more than nominal damages. He also completely denied the class decertification motion. \n\nAfter the defendants' motions were denied, the case slowly crept towards trial, which was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 1, 2021, Judge Lehrburger set a trial date of June 16, 2021.\n\nAs of April 12, 2021, the case remains pending.", "summary": "Persons in the custody of the New York State Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) brought this class action against DOCS and the New York State Division of Parole (DOP) for the extra-judicial imposition of sentences requiring post-release supervision.

The defendants' motion for summary judgment was granted with respect to several defendants, but denied on the issue of qualified immunity; and plaintiffs' cross motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability for three officers was granted. The defendants appealed the qualified immunity decision, but the Second Circuit affirmed. On remand, the defendants moved for summary judgment again, but that motion was denied. The case is currently scheduled for trial in Summer 2021."}
{"document": "Individuals incarcerated in the Tulsa jail sued Tulsa County, the Tulsa County Sheriff, fifteen Special Judges and a district court judge in challenging the constitutionality of the county's wealth-based pretrial detention system. On June 6, 2018, the four plaintiffs, represented by Civil Rights Corps, filed this class-action lawsuit in the Northern District of Oklahoma. The case was assigned to Judge Claire Eagan. The plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Declaratory Judgement Act, alleging that defendants violated their Equal Protection, Due Process, and Sixth Amendment rights by depriving them of their fundamental right to pretrial liberty and failing to provide counsel at bail hearings. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief preventing the defendants from assigning bail without inquiring as to whether criminal defendants can pay it. The plaintiffs also asked the court to permanently enjoin the defendants from denying the putative class-members the right to a speedy, individualized hearing with counsel. \n\nThe plaintiffs were each arrested and informed that they had to pay bail ranging from $500 to $50,000 in order to be released from jail before their hearing. They were not asked whether they could afford the bond; because none of them had the financial resources to post bail, they were held for up to 11 days before their hearing without access to legal counsel. The plaintiffs alleged that this \"wealth-based detention scheme\" jailed presumptively innocent people for at least a week before they are able to challenge their detention. Such a system, the plaintiffs contend, violates the the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n\nThe same day that the complaint was filed, the plaintiffs asked for the court to certify their class. The plaintiffs proposed class consisted of \"all people who are or will be detained in the Tulsa County Jail because they are unable to pay a secured financial condition of release.\"\n\nThe Tulsa County Sheriff answered the complaint on August 3, 2018, and the defendant-judges moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The defendant-judges argued that the plaintiffs failed to use available state court remedies, such as criminal appellate or habeas processes, that could provide relief. Additionally, the defendant-judges also argued that the plaintiffs failed to allege specific misconduct beyond the judges' lack of addressing bail at arraignments.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 22, 2018. However, on November 19, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' amended complaint, the plaintiffs' motion for class-certification, and the defendant-judges' motion to dismiss as moot. 2018 WL 6048016. The court found that the plaintiffs paid their bonds and were released from jail in the days following the original complaint and therefore no longer suffered an actual injury. The court also determined that the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" exception did not apply because these four plaintiffs were expected to comply with the law and therefore this injury was not expected to repeat with regards to these plaintiffs. Additionally, the Court found that the claims were not \"inherently transitory.\"\n\nOn December 11, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider the court's judgment. The plaintiffs objected to the court's characterization of their claims. The plaintiffs argued that they did not challenge their pretrial detention per se, but rather challenged their pretrial detention without counsel and a hearing. The plaintiffs argued that this characterization fit the \"inherently transitory\" exception to mootness because the Court could not reasonably consider a class certification motion before any named plaintiffs’ individual claims became moot.\n\nJudge Eagan agreed with the plaintiffs and, on March 15, 2019, granted their motion for reconsideration. 2019 WL 1231675. The court reinstated the plaintiff's amended complaint and motion for class certification, and also reinstated the defendant-judges' motion to dismiss.\n\nWith the case active again, the defendant-judges filed their answer on March 25, 2019, and responded in opposition the plaintiffs' motion for class certification on April 15. The defendants also moved to stay the proceedings until the Oklahoma Senate considered a bill that would require individualized considerations of the ability to pay bail. On May 9, Judge Eagan granted the motion until the end of the legislative session or until the bill was signed into law. On June 14, the stay was lifted as the legislative session had ended.\n\nThe defendant-judges again moved to dismiss the claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on December 10. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing, since their pre-trial detention had ended and therefore they were no longer suffering an injury.\n\nAfter engaging in settlement talks but failing to reach an agreement, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They contended that the COVID-19 pandemic altered the conditions of detention such that injunctive relief was required in order to prevent irreparable harm to people detained solely based on their inability to pay bail. Judge Eagan denied the plaintiffs' motion on May 11, finding that the preliminary relief was inappropriate given the lack of COVID cases in Tulsa County jails at that time and because a preliminary injunction would not solve the bail issue raised before the pandemic began. 2020 WL 2393855. \n\nAs of January 13, 2021, the case remains ongoing.

{"document": "This federal civil rights case successfully challenged a Davidson county Tennessee rule requiring garnishment of bail bonds, as applied to a non-profit bail bond service. \n\nDavidson County, TN, has a local rule that allows the County Criminal Court to garnish bond deposits made by criminal defendants to pay prior judgment fees--including fines, court costs, and restitution. If incarcerated people do not agree to potential garnishment, they are not allowed to post bond. In practice, the Nashville Community Bail Fund (NCBF), a non-profit that provides bail bonds to indigent arrestees, was exempted from this rule for years. But in September 2019, the County Criminal Court judges revoked the exemption. \n\nOn February 5, 2020, the NCBF filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee (in Nashville). The plaintiff sued the Davidson County Criminal Court Clerk under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by the ACLU, Civil Rights Corps, and a Nashville-based non-profit law firm Choosing Justice Initiative, the plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief. NCBF claimed that the revocation of its longstanding exemption violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on excessive bail as well as the Fourteenth Amendment doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to due process. \n\nOn March 17, 2020 District Judge Aleta Trauger granted NCBF’s motion for a preliminary injunction. This injunction prohibited the County Criminal Court Clerk from requiring NCBF to agree to the garnishment rule for bonds that it sought to post. 446 F. Supp. 3d 282.

{"document": "On May 3, 2016, two indigent citizens who were jailed for not paying traffic and misdemeanor fines, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued the City of El Paso under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Texas Constitution. Represented by lawyers from the Texas Civil Rights Project, the plaintiffs alleged that the City violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as their rights under the Texas Constitution. The plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to enjoin the defendants from enforcing their current debt collection program.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the City adopted a 25-percent plan in 2006 that required those assessed fines, including fines from Class C Misdemeanors and traffic tickets, to either pay 25 percent of their fines or go to jail. The plan did not account for people unable to pay 25 percent of their fines. The repayment plan, alleged the plaintiffs, was adopted as a method of revenue generation for the city. The plaintiffs asserted in their complaint that the City made $19 million from such fines in 2015 and that the policy was pursued purposely, by training municipal court clerks to tell debtors that their only options were the 25-percent payment or jail. The plaintiffs were never informed of their right to assert indigence, and they alleged that the City became aware of issues with its debt collection process but failed to reform the system.\n\nOn January 12, 2017, Judge David Guaderrama issued an order denying in part and granting in part the City's motion to dismiss, which was filed on June 6, 2016. Judge Guaderrama only looked at the due process claims because the City failed to address the equal protection claims. The plaintiffs' main due process claim was that the City's clerks failed to inform indigent debtors of their right to assert indigence. The court dismissed this claim. Judge Guaderrama held that the city had no constitutional duty to inform the plaintiffs of their right to assert their indigence. Judge Guaderrama only addressed the § 1983 action concerning the violation of the plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. He allowed the equal protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment and Texas Constitution to stand because the City had failed to address them in their motion to dismiss. \n\nOn January 20, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and on February 3, 2017, the City responded with a new motion to dismiss, which the Court denied on April 25, 2017. One month later, the Court scheduled a jury trial to take place in March of 2018. After some months of discovery disputes and negotiation between the parties, the defendants again moved to dismiss the case, but the Court rejected the motion as untimely on December 11, 2017. \n\nThe parties continued negotiating and ultimately did reach a settlement agreement, which led the parties to file for a stipulated dismissal on May 23, 2018. That same week, on May 29, 2018, the Court reviewed the stipulated dismissal and entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice. This case is now closed, but the parties may litigate noncompliance with the contractual terms of the settlement agreement. \n\nThe settlement agreement included the following: a full release of any and all claims by both sides; an agreement that each side would bear its own costs; and an agreement that the City would, for three years following the settlement, continue certain administrative practices. These administrative practices related to: (a) notices to defendants of policies and procedures; (b) forms and procedures associated with payment plans, including a policy that payment plans required no money down, and that defendants could request an extension at any time; (c) notices to defendants regarding court hearings and court schedules; (d) policies and procedures related to indigency hearings and the issuance of warrants; and (e) a promise by defendants not to create any notice, form, procedure or policy that is inconsistent with the notices, forms, policies, and procedures that were attached to the settlement agreement. \n", "summary": "In May of 2016 two indigent people brought a suit against the City of El Paso in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for jailing them for failure to pay fines, despite their inability to do so. The plaintiffs brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983, and allege that the Defendants violated their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief. They want to enjoin the Defendants from enforcing their current debt collection program, which jails people who can't pay a certain portion of their fines for traffic and misdemeanor offenses. The Plaintiffs allege that Defendants adopted their debt collection program to generate revenue for they city, and the individual plaintiffs were not informed that they could assert their indigence. Rather, the Plaintiffs were simply told they had to pay or go to jail. On January 12th, 2017 Judge David Guaderrama granted the Defendant's motion to dismiss in part. Judge Guaderrama dismissed the Due Process claims, but did not reach the Equal Protection claims.\r\n\r\nThe Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in January 2017, and after the Court denied two motions to dismiss filed by defendants over the course of 2017, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the action pursuant to a settlement agreement. In the settlement agreement, defendants agreed to maintain certain administrative practices for three years. Among other things, these practices related to notice to defendants, policies and procedures for: payment plans; notice to defendants of court hearings and schedules; and indigency hearings and warrants issued for non-payment.

{"document": "On January 14, 2016, two indigent women that previously served imprisonment terms at the Randall County Jail filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiff sued the city of Amarillo under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought compensatory damages, claiming the City of Amarillo violated their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection Rights. The plaintiffs claimed that the City of Amarillo installed its own debtor’s prison through its municipal code that required residents that owed fees and fines to “Pay or lay.” Although the city provided an installment plan in order to make payments, once an individual missed a payment, a warrant for his or her arrest would be immediately issued. Hearings to determine a person’s indigency or alternate methods of enforcement are not required by the municipal code. The plaintiffs were both single mothers with part-time jobs as their only source of income. Both struggled to secure consistent employment. One plaintiff had an income of $40.00 a month and the court ordered a payment plan that required her to pay $232.00 in biweekly payments until her debt was paid. When the plaintiff informed the court she would be unable to meet this plan and request modification, she was immediately denied modification and sent to jail for eighteen days. The other plaintiff was unaware that she could assert indigency or request a payment plan, she believed her only option was to “pay or lay.” The plaintiff did not have the money to pay all of her fines and served eighteen days in jail.  The plaintiffs sought class certification on behalf of all indigent persons adjudicated by the City of Amarillo Municipal Court that owed fines or court costs and ordered to serve imprisonment terms for failure to pay the adjudicated fines and costs. \n\nThe defendant responded to the complaint with a motion to dismiss on February 11, 2016. The defense argued that a city could not be liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for an alleged policy of wrongfully jailing persons because the decisions are solely made by the municipal judges who are acting in their judicial capacity and the city of Amarillo have no control or influence. The defendant further argued that the complaint failed to allege an official policy promoted by a municipal policymaker that was the moving force behind the constitutional violation claims. The Court did not immediately address the defendant’s motion, instead, it permitted the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on March 2, 2016. In the amended complaint the plaintiffs addressed the concerns provided by the defendant in its earlier motion to dismiss and expanded its Fourteenth Amendment violation claim to include court administrators and the police department. The plaintiffs alleged that the police department had a policy and practice of jailing indigent people without inquiring as to their reasons for nonpayment, determining whether they were indigent, or considering adequate alternatives to incarceration.\n\nOn March 16, 2016, the City of Amarillo filed another motion to dismiss on similar grounds of its previous motion to dismiss and that the plaintiffs’ new claims were conclusive and not supported by any factual underpinnings. Once again, the Court did not immediately address the defendant’s motion to dismiss and permitted the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. \n\nThe discovery period began and plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on April 4, 2016. The new complaint addressed the defendant’s previous issues and added four new plaintiffs that also served imprisonment terms as punishment for their inability to pay ticket fines and court fees.  On April 13, 2016,  the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify class on behalf of all indigent persons adjudicated by the City of Amarillo Municipal Court that owed fines or court costs and ordered to serve imprisonment terms for failure to pay the adjudicated fines and costs. The defendant filed several briefs in response to the plaintiffs motion and discovery continued.\n\nOn August 8, 2016, Senior Judge Mary Lou Robinson entered an opinion and order granting the defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as to all of the plaintiffs’ 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims. The Court also denied the plaintiffs’ motion to certify class as moot due to the previous order to dismiss the case. Judge Robinson entered her final judgment in favor of the defendant and declared that the defendant was entitled to reasonable and necessary costs as a result of the action. \n\nThe plaintiffs objected to the defendant’s bill of costs on August 30, 2016. On October 12, 2016, Judge Robinson partially sustained the plaintiffs’ objections and ordered for the plaintiffs’ to pay $3,660.00 to the defendant in costs. \n\nThere are no further entries on this docket, inferring that this case is closed. \n", "summary": "In January 2016, two indigent women that served imprisonment terms at the Randall County Jail filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.

{"document": "The advocacy organization Children's Rights, Inc. filed this lawsuit in June 2002 against the state of Georgia and the Departments of Family and Children Services (DFCS) in Fulton and DeKalb Counties, on behalf of children in foster care in Fulton and DeKalb counties. Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Georgia State Constitution, the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Medicaid Act, and the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994. The complaint alleged that children did not receive necessary treatment and services while spending months in emergency shelters, experienced abuse and neglect as a result of an insufficient number of caseworkers, and received inadequate health care and emotional services while in foster care. Plaintiffs originally brought suit in Georgia state courts, but the stated removed the case to federal court because the cause of action included federal laws.\n\nJudge Marvin Shoob of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification in August 2003, and at the same time granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in part regarding certain claims about the operation of emergency shelters, because the shelters had been closed. The Court denied a later motion for summary judgment filed by the counties and found that children in foster care in Georgia have a state statutory and constitutional right to effective counsel in child abuse and neglect proceedings. Kenny A. v. Perdue, 356 F. Supp. 2d 1353 (N.D. Ga. 2005).\n\nIn July 2005, Georgia agreed to a settlement that limited the caseload of case workers and required the state to meet benchmarks in numerous areas of service to children, including medical, dental, and mental health screenings and treatment. The court assigned two independent monitors to report on Georgia's progress towards meeting the benchmarks. \n\nThe county defendants entered into a consent decree with plaintiffs in May 2006; it approved the right-to-counsel settlements and established independent monitors for each county until the counties remain in substantial compliance for a continuous eighteen month period. The consent decrees established staffing requirements and caseloads for child advocate attorneys, and other bureaucratic changes to how Fulton County manages its County Child Advocate Attorneys office. DeKalb County and Fulton County were released from federal oversight in October 2008 and April 2011, respectively, because they had improved the quality of representation provided to foster children.\n\nIn August 2008, the plaintiffs filed a contempt motion against the state, citing its failure to meet court-ordered requirements to place hundreds of children in permanent homes. The state and plaintiffs jointly filed an agreement to consult national welfare experts in order to review the cases of all children in the backlog and to place them in permanent homes. The court Monitor has made six-month reports on the Georgia's progress towards meeting benchmarks.\n\nOn November 2, 2015, the parties agreed to a joint stipulation and order to modify the consent decree.  The original consent decree required two independent accountability agents, but the parties agree to reduce that to one agent. \n\nOn February 16, 2016, the independent monitor team submitted a report finding the State was still not compliant with the court-ordered benchmarks.  On February 24, 2016, the case was transferred from Judge Shoob, who had had it since its inception in 2002, to Judge Thomas W. Thrash, Jr. \n\nOn December 5, 2016, the court granted a joint motion to modify the consent decree, adding additional clarifications and stipulations regarding placements, visitation, outcome measures, process and infrastructure requirements, terms upon which State Defendants may move for the termination of the consent decree, and dispute resolution provisions. The modified consent decree also provided for biannual reports from the Monitoring and Technical Assistance Team on the ongoing and attained outcomes. \n\nThe civil case was closed on August 17, 2017, but biannual monitoring reports continue to be filed. As of June 2018, the monitoring report noted that the Dekalb and Fulton County directors were prioritizing increasing the staff size and quality of training while emphasizing keeping families together and reducing the foster population. However, the report also found that there were inconsistencies in the data relating to caseload, vacancies, new hires and turnover. \n\nAs of April 2020, the biannual monitoring reports continue to be filed. The January 2020 report shows that the counties have continued to increase their efforts to initially search for and place children with relatives, visitation has improved in all areas, and the state met the threshold for timelines to adoption and guardianship after parental rights have been terminated or released. However, the region continues to struggle with children and teenagers re-entering care and with meeting educational and mental health needs of children in care. \n\n<i>Attorneys fees</i>\n\nIn addition to the litigation regarding enforcement of the consent decree, this case also included extensive litigation regarding the award of attorney's fees to the plaintiffs.  The consent decree with the State did not resolve the issue of attorney's fees and the parties had left that to the court to decide. The plaintiffs submitted a request for more than $14 million in attorney's fees. Half of that amount was based on their calculation of the lodestar (the number of hours spent working on the case multiplied by the attorneys' hourly rate). The other half was a fee enhancement for superior work and results.  The defendants  objected to the fee request, contending that some of the proposed hourly rates were too high, that the hours claimed were excessive, and that the enhancement would duplicate factors that were reflected in the lodestar amount.\n\nOn October 3, 2006, the district court awarded fees of approximately $10.5 million. 454 F.Supp.2d 1260 (N.D.Ga.2006). The court determined that the lodestar was $6 million and then enhanced that amount by 75% to account for superior performance and results.   The defendants appealed this determination to the Eleventh Circuit. \n\nAfter oral argument, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's award because it was not an abuse of discretion to award that amount of attorney's fees on July 3, 2008.  532 F.3d 1209 (2008).  The eleventh circuit judges were divided over the district court's enhancement. The Eleventh Circuit denied the defendants' request for a rehearing en banc but was also divided over this ruling. The defendants petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari seeking review solely as to the $4.5 million enhancement, which the Supreme Court granted.  The Supreme Court heard oral argument on October 14, 2009.\n\nThen, on April 21, 2010, the Supreme Court reversed the award of attorney's fees and remanded the case for further proceedings.  The Supreme Court reaffirmed the rule that enhancements are permitted in extraordinary circumstances, but held that the district court had not provided proper justification for the enhancement it awarded in this case. The Supreme Court outlined standards for enhancements: 1) there is a strong presumption that the lodestar is sufficient; 2) factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot be used as a ground for increasing an award above the lodestar; and 3) a party seeking fees has the burden of identifying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take into account and proving with specificity that an enhanced fee is justified. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded because the District Court had not applied these standards.  559 U.S. 542 (2010).\n\nAccordingly, on September 2, 2010, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's order and judgment entered on October 3, 2006, awarding the plaintiffs attorney's fees, costs, and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court's decision and opinion. 616 F.3d 1230 (2010).  \n\nThe parties submitted new briefs and the district court heard oral argument on the issue. On July 19, 2011, the district court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to an enhancement under the new guidelines established by the Supreme Court.

{"document": "On August 4, 1999, a group of children in the legal and/or physical custody of the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) filed this lawsuit against the State of New Jersey and DYFS in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Represented in part by Children's Rights, Inc., the plaintiffs alleged that DYFS failed to protect them from abuse, failed to provide them with services such as medical care, and failed to provide DYFS caseworkers with adequate resources and training. The plaintiffs claimed these actions violated federal common law and federal statutes. They named, in particular, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. §§ 620-27, 670-679; Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, as amended by the Interethnic Adoption Provisions of 1996; Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act; Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Program, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq; the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131; and the Rehabilitation Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 794. Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that New Jersey and DYFS’s actions violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights to association, privacy and family integrity under the First and Ninth Amendments. With the complaint, the plaintiffs also moved for class certification.\n\nOn October 12, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. On January 27, 2000, U.S. District Judge Garrett E. Brown granted the motion with respect to the plaintiffs’ substantive due process cause of action. The court dismissed the substantive due process claim to the extent it was alleged on behalf of children who were voluntarily in state custody. The court held there was no substantive due process right to “not remain in state custody unnecessarily” or “to be housed in the least restrictive, most appropriate and family-like placement while in state custody.” The court also dismissed the plaintiffs’ cause of action under the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 because the plaintiffs failed to allege that they were denied the opportunity to become an adoptive or foster parent on the basis of race, color, or national origin.. The court denied the motion for all the other asserted causes of action, and noted that \"[t]here [was] no term other than tragic to summarize the facts\" alleged in this case. <i>Charlie H. v. Whitman</i>, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476 (D.N.J. 2000).\n\nAfter some procedural wrangling, in October 2000, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint as well as a modified motion to certify class action. By March 2001, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from conducting an audit of DYFS case records. The court then ordered the defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be entered. On June 28, 2001, the court again denied the plaintiffs' motion to certify class action, concluding that the plaintiffs’ class definition was overly broad. On July 30, 2001, the plaintiffs again filed a third motion for class certification, which the court granted on March 7, 2002. During this time, on September 28, 2001, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction after determining that the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm and that injunctive relief was warranted. The parties proceeded towards trial and commenced discovery.\n\nMeanwhile, on January 27, 2003, the New York Times and other newspapers moved to intervene in the case in order to modify the confidentiality orders. The court granted the motions in part for purposes of reporting to the public about the state of the child welfare system. <i>Charlie H. v. Whitman</i>, 213 F.R.D. 240 (D.N.J. 2003). The New York Times published a series of articles focused on the New Jersey child welfare system, including several pieces about the death of Faheem Williams, a seven-year-old boy whose case had been closed by DYFS even though there were outstanding issues of abuse.\n\nOnce discovery concluded, on February 27, 2003, the court entered an order referring the parties to mediation and appointed former New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Stewart G. Pollack. Through mediation, the parties reached a settlement agreement in July 2003. After a fairness hearing, the court approved the settlement agreement on September 2, 2003. Under the core principles that the foster care placements be as temporary an arrangement as possible, with its goal being to provide to children in out-of-home environment safe permanent placements, the settlement agreement mandated the creation of an expert panel (the New Jersey Child Welfare Panel) which was tasked to begin the planning process for improvements in the child welfare system and overall supervision and technical assistance during the 18 month period. The agreement also set out planning procedures, definition of improved outcomes for children, and review process. Areas of immediate mandates included securing funds ($14.3 million) to hire additional man power, conducting safety assessments, reviewing high-risk facilities individually, reviewing standards for licensing, reviewing hiring processes, among others. The agreement also mandated the appointment of a monitor.\n\nOn February 26, 2004, the plaintiffs moved to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> on behalf of three class members, currently in DYFS custody, to protect their interests in any claims for damages they may have against DYFS. On April 5, 2004, after oral argument on this motion, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>. The plaintiffs then moved for $150,000 in attorneys’ fees and expenses on September 27, 2004. The court granted that motion on November 5, 2004.\n\nIn October 2005, the court-appointed monitor found that the state was making \"seriously inadequate progress\" in implementing the terms of the settlement agreement. During this time, the Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO (CWA) were granted leave to appear as <i>amicus curiae</i>.\n\nAfter unsuccessful negotiations between the parties to improve progress levels, in December 2005, the plaintiffs moved to hold the defendants in contempt for noncompliance with the consent decree. However, the newly elected governor created a new cabinet-level children's agency and began new negotiations with the plaintiffs. As a result, the parties modified the settlement agreement in July 2006. \n\nThe modified settlement agreement provided for phased implementation. In Phase 1, lasting from July 2006 to December 2008, the state committed to working in collaboration with the Monitor to develop a case practice model that addresses issues of regular case planning, development of individualized service plans, and training for caseworkers. Among the increased services for youth are mental health services, services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth, and regular medical examinations. \n\nPhase II, from January 2009 until termination of the agreement, required completion of certain outcomes based on numerous indicators—e.g., that all children are safe from abuse and that siblings are placed together. The settlement provided for bi-annual reports by a monitor and established a dispute resolution process. Until November 2015, the monitor filed reports in accordance with the modified agreement.\n\nOn November 4, 2015, the second modified settlement agreement was entered. The 2015 agreement identified as areas to be achieved: timely and quality completion of investigations on alleged child abuse and neglect, timely execution of initial and subsequent family team meetings, proper needs assessment, timely and quality planning of cases, proper management of intake/adoption workers' caseloads, proper parent-child/siblings visitations, stable placements (with siblings, where possible), prevention of repeat maltreatment and re-entry to placement, timely discharge to permanent placement, provision of services to support transition and independent living assessment of older youth. The agreement stipulated that once defendants demonstrated compliance during a period longer than 12 months, the court would terminate its jurisdiction over the case. The first monitor’s report for the new agreement was filed in June 2016.\n\nEnforcement of the settlement agreement is ongoing.", "summary": "Plaintiffs, who are children in the custody of the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), brought suit against the state alleging abuse, neglect, and lack of services. After the New York Times published several articles about the deaths of children in the care of DYFS due to lack of care, in 2003 the state entered into a settlement agreement providing for a systematic overhaul of the state child welfare system.  The latest modification of the agreement was made in 2015 and remains in force."}
{"document": "This federal class action was brought by children in the custody of the New York City Child Welfare Administration (\"CWA\"), and children who, while not in the custody of CWA, are or will be at risk of abuse or neglect and whose status is known or should be known to CWA.  It was filed on December 13, 1995 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The plaintiffs, represented by Children's Rights Inc., Lawyers for Children, and private counsel, sought class certification, declaratory and injunctive relief against both the city and the state (collectively, the defendants). The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants violated the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program of the Medicaid Act, the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and state law.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants systematically:<ul><li> failed to protect the plaintiffs from abuse and neglect and to provide them and their families with appropriate, legally required services;\n<li> failed to appropriately accept reports of child abuse and neglect for investigation;\n<li> failed to investigate those reports of child abuse and neglect that are accepted in the time and manner required by law;\n<li> failed to provide mandated pre-placement preventive services to enable children at risk of being  placed in foster care to remain at home safely with their families whenever possible;\n<li> failed to provide children in need of foster care placement with the least restrictive, most family-like placements designed to meet their individual needs;\n<li> failed to provide foster children, their birth families and their foster families with the services that are essential to ensuring that the children do not deteriorate in CWA's custody;\n<li> failed to provide foster children with disabilities with placements and services appropriate to their individual needs and necessary to allow these children fully to participate in the City's child welfare system;\n<li> failed to provide foster children with appropriate case management, case plans and services;\n<li> failed to provide children for whom adoption is appropriate with services necessary to ensure that they are adopted quickly;\n<li> failed to provide teenage children who will leave the foster care system to live on their own with services adequate to prepare them to live independently;\n<li> failed to provide foster children with the administrative, judicial and dispositional reviews to which they are legally entitled;\n<li> failed to provide caseworkers with sufficient training, support and supervision; and\n<li> failed to maintain an adequate information system to monitor, track and plan for children, and to manage the child welfare system effectively. </ul>As a result of these systemic deficiencies, the plaintiffs contended that the defendants jeopardized their well being. \n\nOn June 18, 1996, District Judge Robert J. Ward certified a class of children in foster care and those reported to be abused or neglected. The court also denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, interpreting children's constitutional right to protection from harm to include harm that results from unnecessary separation from parents and from extended stays in foster care without a permanent family.  Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 929 F. Supp. 662 (1996).  Some procedural skirmishes dealing with the defendants' interlocutory appeal followed.  On September 26, 1997, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's certification of the plaintiff class and directed that the district judge divide the classes into subclasses for organizational and management purposes.  Marisol A. v Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372 (2d Cir. 1997).\n\nIn July of 1998, the parties began settlement negotiations. Over the objections of would-be intervenors representing a subclass of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender youths in the custody of the city agency, the court approved separate settlement agreements with the city and the state defendants in March 1999.  Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 185 F.R.D. 152 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).  Objectors appealed, but on July 10, 2000, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's approval of both the city and state settlement agreements.  Joel A. v. Giuliani, 218 F.3d 132 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\nThe class action settlement required the city to use independent outside child welfare experts to guide and assist it in undertaking systemic reform. The advisory panel had complete access to all aspects of the city's child welfare agency, and was empowered to provide recommendations, issue progress reports on the status of the reform effort, and determine whether the city is acting in good faith in implementing systemic reform. The city settlement was successfully concluded in 2001.\n\nThe plaintiffs returned to court in January 2001, seeking an order directing compliance by the state with specific terms of the state settlement agreement.  The areas of alleged noncompliance included the failure to implement a statewide child welfare management information system. After an August 2001 evidentiary hearing, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion in part, holding that the state had acted with insufficient diligence in implementing the information management system.  Marisol A. ex re. Forbes v. Giuliani, 157 F. Supp. 2d 303 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  Judge Ward extended the term of the agreement in this area, and directed that the state file semi-annual reports with the plaintiffs until the Court determined that the state had fully complied with the relevant portions of the agreement. \n\nVery little activity appears in the docket after that ruling. The state filed a report required by the settlement agreement in July 2008, and then there was nearly a 10-year gap. In 2017, the case was reassigned to Judge George Daniels and then Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker. Also, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (“OCFS”) filed one of its required semi-annual reports stating that OCFS was taking reasonable efforts to develop and implement a diligent and sufficient information management system for child welfare needs. \n\nA status conference was held on July 26, 2018. After that conference, the court issued an order relinquishing its jurisdiction over that portion of the settlement agreement on August 6. Since the other parts of the settlement had terminated in 2001, the case is now closed.

The case was filed on December 13, 1995, and the parties reached to two separate settlement agreements, one with the city and one with the state, on December 2, 1988. The plaintiffs returned to court in January 2001, seeking an order directing the state to comply with specific terms of the state settlement agreement. The court found that the state had acted with insufficient diligence in implementing the information management system, and therefore extended the terms of the agreement in this area and directed that the plaintiffs receive semi-annual reports. The defendants provided a January 2017 report to show that they were continuing to develop, implement, and update their information systems for child welfare needs. A year later, the court ended its supervision of the portions of the settlement that it had retained jurisdiction to enforce. "}
{"document": "On May 12, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that New York's Administration for Children's Services (ACS) routinely forces children in foster care to be unnecessarily institutionalized in psychiatric hospitals rather than placed in home-like settings. The plaintiffs alleged that ACS was using placement in psychiatric institutions as punishment for misbehavior and that many children placed in these hospitals did not have a diagnosis of mental illness. The plaintiffs also alleged that children were forced to stay in institutions long after it was determined that they could be placed in a less restrictive environment, but that ACS's policies made discharge difficult.\n\nThe named plaintiffs, three currently institutionalized children, requested their release from institutions. They also sought to represent a class of children and demanded that the court order ACS to discontinue its \"illegal pattern and practice of 'dumping' children in foster care in psychiatric hospitals and refusing to let them out.\" The plaintiffs alleged that these policies violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, state laws and regulations, the New York Constitution, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n\nThe case moved quickly toward settlement, with the parties stipulating to certify the class and postpone a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. The class was certified as:<blockquote> Children under the age of 18 who are in the custody of the New York City Administration for Children's Services (\"ACS\") and who are currently admitted or will be brought to and admitted to acute psychiatric hospitals and who, once admitted and deemed ready for discharge, are not moved by ACS and/or one of its contract agencies to the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs.</blockquote>In November 2010, the parties submitted a settlement agreement to the court for preliminary approval.  District Judge Brian M.

Plaintiff, represented by Children's Rights, Inc. and private counsel, asked the court for damages, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees.  Plaintiff claimed that Defendants' policies and customs failed to comply with federal and state law, which violated Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment rights, and that their gross negligence caused him permanent mental harm and injury. Specifically, Plaintiff claimed that while he was placed at BHOTS--a \"low management\" group home licensed by SCDSS that did not require awake staff at all times--he was repeatedly attacked and sexually assaulted by older boys at the home. He claimed that Defendants violated his rights to a safe and secure placement in state custody, his right to adequate supervision, and his right to prompt mental health treatment under both federal and state law.\n\nOn June 28, 2013, Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.\n\nOver the next few months, the parties engaged in fact and expert discovery. As discovery proceeded, Plaintiff agreed to stipulate to the dismissal of several of the individual Defendants. The remainder of the Defendants, including SCDSS and BHOTS, moved for summary judgment.\n\nOn February 4, 2014, while the motions for summary judgment were pending, Plaintiff and the BHOTS Defendants reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum of money, including $188,285.27 in costs.

{"document": "On January 12, 2015, eleven named minor children in the legal custody of the South Carolina Department of Social Services (\"SCDSS\") filed this putative class action lawsuit (by their Next Friends) against the Governor of South Carolina and SCDSS in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The named plaintiffs were represented by two advocacy organizations, Children's Rights and Appleseed, and by private counsel. Plaintiffs intended to seek certification of a class of all children who are or will be involuntarily placed in foster care in the legal custody of SCDSS as a result of emergency protective custody and/or a referral, report, suspicion, allegation and/or adjudication of abuse or neglect. Plaintiffs asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging systemic deficiencies in the operation of SCDSS subjected children in the state's care to harm or an unreasonable risk of harm.\n\nThe alleged problems included: whether SCDSS maintains an adequate number and kind of foster homes, resulting in over-institutionalization of foster children, repeated movement of children between placements, and deprivation of meaningful familial contacts; whether SCDSS has excessive caseworker caseloads, resulting in a workforce that cannot monitor children's safety, maltreatment in SCDSS care, and failure to investigate maltreatment; and whether SCDSS fails to provide initial and periodic medical, dental, and mental health assessments, treatments, and screens, leading to emotional and psychological deterioration of children in SCDSS custody.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On March 30, 2015, with Defendants' motion pending, the District Court (Judge Richard M. Gergel) entered a text order asking the parties to engage in early mediation. The Court indicated that Senior District Judge Michael Duffy had agreed to mediate, should the parties consent. Later that week, the parties indicated that they were willing to engage in early mediation.\n\nOn September 28, 2015, the parties entered into an interim settlement agreement. As part of the \"Consent Immediate Interim Relief Order,\" the plaintiff class was certified and \"limited co-monitors\" were appointed. SCDSS also agreed to undertake several remedial steps, including phasing out use of SCDSS offices, hotels and motels as placements and no longer recommending that children remain in juvenile detention because of a lack of foster homes. SCDSS also agreed to undertake a workload study, adopt workload limits, conduct a placement needs assessment, and create a plan to end the placement of children ages six and under in non-family group placements.\n\nJudge Gergel approved the parties' final class action settlement agreement on October 4, 2016. The agreement defined the class as \"all children who are involuntarily placed in DSS foster care in the physical or legal custody of DSS either now or in the future.\" Pursuant to the agreement, the court appointed two co-monitors to issue periodic public reports on the parties' compliance with the settlement agreement. SCDSS agreed to (1) complete a foster care workload study and adopt workload limits; (2) ensure that worker-child visitation happens with appropriate frequency; (3) adopt enhanced investigation procedures; (4) adopt procedures to ensure appropriate child placement; (5) provide for family visitation; and (6) develop a health care improvement plan. The settlement agreement was to remain in effect until the Court issued an order dismissing the case. Regarding attorneys' fees, the parties agreed to submit the amount and terms of fees and expenses to final and binding arbitration by the mediator (District Judge P. Michael Duffy). \n\nIn the September 2018 report, the co-monitors outlined several areas of accomplishment: leadership changes and internal restructuring; development of a five-year budget; building infrastructure to meet children's healthcare needs; conducting a data audit; and development of a training plan and case practice model. The co-monitors also identified several areas in need of focus and improvement. One of these areas was investigative practice within SCDSS’s Out-of-Home Abuse and Neglect (OHAN) unit. The co-monitors noted that a lack of resources meant that staff had excessive case loads and did not have the time, direction, or tools to complete their work. Another area in need of improvement was SCDSS's placement array and processes. While SCDSS made some progress in reducing the number of children placed in congregate care and staying overnight at SCDSS offices, there had been little improvement in the period leading up to the September 2018 report. Finally, the co-monitors noted a need for improvement in the area of workforce recruitment and retention.\n\nIn response to the September report, the plaintiffs filed a motion to hold the defendants in contempt for non-compliance with the settlement agreement on November 26, 2018. On December 5, 2018, the Court issued an order stating that, starting in January 2019, the Court will hold monthly status conferences to assess SCDSS's implementation of the reforms mandated by the settlement agreement. Prior to the first status conference, SCDSS must submit plans about the three main areas in need of reform: workloads, placement, and healthcare. The order also required that SCDSS appoint staff responsible for those three areas. Finally, the order required that the parties conduct a mediation session prior to the January status conference. \n\nThe parties participated in mediation, and the monitoring arrangement continued with monthly status conferences. On August 15, 2019, the court issued an order stating that the settlement agreement required the defendants to have reached a set of benchmarks by July 1, 2020, that they had yet to achieve. The order further stated that the expectation remained that they would meet these benchmarks. \n\nAs of May 22, 2020, the most recent biannual monitors' report was filed on March 2, 2020.

{"document": "On July 22, 2013, attorneys from United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division (DOJ) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the State of Florida. The DOJ alleged that nearly two hundred children with disabilities were unnecessarily segregated from their communities and the general population by the State, which had placed them in nursing homes. The DOJ sought an injunction requiring the State to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131-12134, which, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of disabled individuals, and mandates that their rehabilitative and medical needs be provided in a manner that enables disabled individuals to be independent and integrated members of the community. The federal regulations implementing the ADA require that disabled recipients of government benefits receive those benefits in the most integrated setting,\" i.e., and environment that \"enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible...\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), App. B., at 673 (2011).\n\nAccording to the DOJ's complaint, the unnecessary institutionalization of children denies them the opportunity to develop bonds with family and limits their ability to interact with people without disabilities. The DOJ also asserted that placement in nursing homes denies children important experiences that contribute to healthy child development. The nursing homes in which these children were institutionalized resembled hospitals, with children housed in rooms shared by one to three other patients. According to the DOJ's complaint the facilities did not prove adequate, age-appropriate stimulation. The children had limited very limited control over how they spent their time. The complaint provides as an example an instance an institutionalized teenager asked to be taken in his wheelchair to an activity area. The teen was taken to a room where he was left with a group of toddlers listening to nursery rhymes.\n\nThe DOJ also alleged that Florida's policies and practices of limiting community-based services and its reductions to these services, and the State's unnecessarily burdensome recertification processes for individuals receiving these services, put at risk of unnecessary institutionalization children who were dependent on these services and who received care in their family homes or in small, community-based facilities. The complaint noted that Florida's reimbursement rates for home-based health services had not been raised or modified since 1987.  The complaint also noted that the State's reductions to in-home care services coincided with an increase in the number of children placed in nursing facilities. In 2004 there were about 136 spots in nursing facilities designated to serve children, and by 2012, more than two hundred children resided in such facilities, in addition to a significant number of adults who remained in the facilities after entering as children. \n\nIn September 2012, after conducting a six-month investigation, the DOJ had provided notice to Florida that it had found the State to be in violation of the ADA. The complaint acknowledges that Florida had made some improvements to its policies, but alleged that the State's processes for transitioning institutionalized children into community-based settings remained deficient. After several months of negotiations, the DOJ determined that the State would not comply with the ADA requirements voluntarily, and therefore it filed this suit.\n\nThe DOJ sought injunctions barring Florida from failing to provide adequate community-based services and support for institutionalized disabled children and those children at risk of institutionalization. They also sought compensatory damages for injuries suffered by these children as a result of Florida's failure to comply with Title II of the ADA, and a declaratory judgment holding Florida to have violated the ADA.\n\nOn June 26, 2014, the Court consolidated this case with another pending case, <i> A.R. v.

The developers had also cooperated with Canton Township to build adjacent shopping and entertainment facilities. \n\nWhen the plaintiff moved in, he discovered multiple accessibility problems inside the unit. Defendants assured him they would be fixed, but they never were. Additionally, at the front door to the apartment, there were concrete steps, making it impossible for him to enter.

The proposed plaintiff class, represented by a named plaintiff, consists of disabled students in the Jackson Public School District (JPS).  The complaint alleged individual and systemic violations of IDEA by the School District, and that the State has continually failed to ensure that the School District meets its federally mandated obligations under IDEA. IDEA requires that a state provide a free appropriate public education to all students with disabilities, and that this education be provided in the least restrictive environment with minimal segregation from their non-disabled peers.  The Plaintiffs allege that the State's failure to enforce IDEA has resulted in potentially thousands of students being denied their guaranteed free and appropriate public education, and seek injunctive relief requiring the State to execute its responsibilities under IDEA. \n\nThe named plaintiff and a class of similarly situated students had, in September 2010, filed an administrative complaint against the Jackson Public School District with the State, alleging systemic violations of IDEA and the failure to provide a free and appropriate public education(\"FAPE\"). Alleged violations included: that the School District denied the students an appropriate level of related services to address their behavioral needs and goals, and denied many students with any such services; that the School District failed comply with IDEA's disciplinary regulations with regards to functional behavioral assessments (\"FBA\"), behavior intervention plans (\"BIP\"), and manifestation determination reviews (\"MDRS\"); that the School District failed to confer meaningful educational benefit; that they failed to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements relating to the development and implementation of individualized educational programs (\"IEP\"); that they failed to provide educational services in the least restrictive environment (\"LRE\"); that the School District failed to provide students with necessary and appropriate transition services; and that it failed to provide students with necessary and appropriate extended school year (\"ESY\") services. \n\nThe State Department of Education investigated and in November of 2010 issued a report that substantiated every one of the violations. The Plaintiffs alleged in the July 2012 complaint that the School District continued, despite this investigation, to violate the rights of the Plaintiff class, and that the State exhibited complete indifference to the ongoing violations, and that it failed to take appropriate action to compel JPS to correct its violations of IDEA.  The Plaintiffs allege that the State bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that local school districts comply with IDEA, and that the State has completely failed to exercise this responsibility.\n\nLess than ten percent of students with disabilities graduate from the School District.

They seek an injunction enjoining the State from subjecting disabled students to practices that violate their rights under IDEA and compelling the State to fulfill its duties under IDEA. They also seek reasonable costs and attorney's fees.\n\nOn September 17, 2012, the Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint that added two additional named plaintiffs and which made minor changes to the formulation of their arguments. The allegations remained substantially the same.  One November 4, 2012, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Certify Class, on November 11, 2012 the Plaintiffs filed a motion for a Preliminary Injunction, and on November 27, the Defendant filed a motion to dismiss. These motions remained pending until May 28, 2013. See below.\n\nAt a January 23, 2013 settlement conference, the parties agreed to put a temporary stay on the case while they pursued settlement.  Two days later, one of the added named plaintiffs from the Amended Complaint withdrew from the case. His claims were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.\n\nApparently settlement negotiations failed, because on May 28, 2013 the stay was lifted and the pending motions terminated without decision.  The parties were instructed to refile their motions, in light of any new facts that may have developed in the intervening period.  \n\nOn June 14, 2013 the plaintiff refiled their motion for class certification and on June 28, 2013 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.  The plaintiffs responded with a motion for discovery and an accompanying request to convert the defendant's motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment due to the advanced stage of proceedings.  However, the plaintiff's motion was denied on September 6, 2013.  \n\nThe parties continued to file responses and replies to the defendant's motion to dismiss until April 18, 2014 when parties filed a joint motion to stay proceedings while they attempted to negotiate a settlement.  Judge Daniel P. Jordan III granted the order and recommended the case back to Magistrate Judge F. Keith Ball for settlement negotiations.\n\nAfter approximately four and a half months, on September 29, 2014, the parties filed a joint motion to administratively close the case after reaching a settlement agreement.  The agreement noted that as of February 12, 2014, JPS had corrected any and all violations under the IDEA.  The agreement further stipulated that the MDE would assist JPS with the implementation of a Program Sustainability Plan for the 2014-2015 school year.  The agreement also included that the MDE would conduct quarterly assessments of JPS's progress, compile a report regarding progress, and supply the reports to the plaintiff.  \n\nOn September 11, 2015 District Court Judge Daniel P.

{"document": "On August 3, 2005, a group of people with disabilities filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the New York Human Resources Administration (NYHRA). The complaint was brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging violation of these Acts, as well as the Due Process Clauses of the U.S. and New York Constitutions and the New York State and City civil rights statutes and regulations. \n\nRepresented by the Legal Aid Society and private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the NYHRA discriminated against them by involuntarily transferring their public benefits cases from their neighborhood welfare center to one of three \"hub\" centers that were exclusively designated for people with disabilities. The plaintiffs further claimed that these \"hub\" centers segregated people with disabilities and failed to provide reasonable accommodations to those whose disability made it difficult to travel. The plaintiffs asked the court for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, injunctive and declaratory relief, and attorney's fees.\n\nOn September 19, 2005, Judge Laura Taylor Swain approved a stipulation between the two parties where the defendant agreed to (1) transfer the named plaintiffs back to their local welfare centers, (2) stop the involuntary transfer of disabled persons, (3) provide the plaintiffs with notice of any voluntary transfers and (4) combine the hearing on the temporary restraining order with the hearing on the preliminary injunction. On November 11, 2005, the Court approved another stipulation where the defendant agreed to stop involuntary transfers and give notice of voluntary transfers.\n\nOn April 19, 2006, Judge Swain certified a plaintiff class defined as \"recipients of public assistance, food stamps and/or Medicaid who have received or will receive a notice from the New York City Human Resources Administration involuntarily transferring their case to one of three 'hub centers' in Manhattan, the Bronx or Brooklyn in connection with the WeCARE program\". In the same order, Judge Swain issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the NYHRA from reassigning class members' cases to the hubs and requiring the NYHRA to give the transferred plaintiffs the right to return their case to their local center. This preliminary injunction was suspended on May 16, 2006, after the NYHRA informed the court that it was closing the hub centers.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to request that the court order the defendant to reopen cases that were closed due to class members failing to attend mandatory meetings at the hub centers. \n\nFor the next five years, discovery and negotiations dominated the case. The case was reassigned in November of 2011 to Judge Katherine B. Forrest. \n\nOn March 27, 2012, the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether any of the plaintiff class would be excluded from the collection of compensatory damages, which was denied by Judge Forrest as premature.\n\nFollowing two more years of discovery, on November 25, 2014, the parties entered into a partial settlement. The agreement included compensation for foregone Cash Assistance benefits, reimbursement for Medicaid-covered expenses, and expungement of sanctions incurred while class members were assigned to hubs. Then, on March 11, 2015, Judge Forrest reviewed a proposed settlement of all claims, preliminarily approving it subject to a fairness hearing. \n\nUnder the proposed settlement, the defendant agreed to implement a broad set of policies and practices for class members. This included implementing \"Disability Inquiry Methods\", written scripts and screening protocols for the staff to identify client disabilities that may pose barriers to complying with program requirements and maintaining access to benefits, as well as any needed Reasonable Accommodation (as defined by the ADA).  The agency agreed to have a non-exhaustive list of reasonable accommodations available to identified clients. The agency agreed to help facilitate successful federal disability benefit applications, including a referral to a vendor to assist with appealing a denial of benefits. The agreement also outlined procedures for mandatory pre- and post-reminders for appointments, and protocols for hospitalized and homeless class members. The agency also agreed to additional training, to accept feedback from a Disability Advisory Community Panel, to have court supervised monitoring, and to have more accessible materials available. \n\nOn June 22, 2015, Judge Forrest approved the class action settlement. After three years of negotiations and the parties agreeing to multiple extensions, on January 26, 2018, the City of New York agreed to pay attorney's fees in the amount of $6,500,000, with $5,434,936 going to The Legal Aid Society and the remainder going to private counsel.

To implement this program, the Library purchased 65 Nook Simple Touch e-reading devices, which the plaintiffs alleged were completely inaccessible to blind users. The plaintiffs alleged that accessible alternative devices were readily available on the market. The e-reader program was funded in part by a $25,000 federal grant from a program established by the Library Services and Technology Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9121, et seq.\n\nThe Plaintiffs, in their complaint, argued that the Library had been alerted by several groups of the federal requirement to acquire only accessible technology and its obligation to conform its practices to federal law. Among these sources were the American Library Association, of which the Library is a member; in 2009 it passed a resolution recommending that members ensure electronic resources comply with federal accessibility guidelines.  In addition, a 2010 \"Dear Colleague Letter\" from the United States Departments of Justice and Education had warned educational institutions not to procure or use inaccessible e-reader technology because the use of such technology would violate federal law.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, the parties reached a settlement, and on October 23 the parties filed a Notice to Dismiss the case with prejudice, referencing the settlement. In the Settlement Agreement, the library denied any legal liability related to the allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaint, but agreed to make its e-reader program fully accessible to blind patrons. To this end, the settlement implements a timetable, committing to procure 10 mainstream e-reader devices accessible to both sighted and blind patrons within sixty days of the Settlement Agreement, which initially were to be available to patrons with visual impairments or other print disabilities. The library agreed that, within four years of the agreement, it would stop lending inaccessible devices and ensure the full accessibility of all the e-readers it made available. \n\nThe Library also agreed to train relevant staff members on the accessibility features of the devices, and to publicize the availability of the accessible devices. It further agreed to use its best efforts to ensure that all new contracts with its vendors contain an accessibility clause requiring that information technology products and services sold to the Library to not cause the Library to be in violation of its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act or Title II of the ADA.

{"document": "On January 20, 2011, Voices for Independence, a non-profit disability advocacy group, and a class of disabled individuals, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, against Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), and Millcreek Township. The Plaintiffs alleged that the pedestrian walkways, sidewalks, and intersections in Millcreek Township were not in compliance with the accessibility mandates of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701. They alleged that the walkways and intersections were dangerous and that people using wheelchairs were forced to travel in the streets because of the absence of curb cuts. They further alleged that PennDOT and Millcreek had altered the sidewalks, walkways, and intersections, using federal and state funds, in ways that triggered mandatory compliance with ADA guidelines. The number of proposed class members was large; at the time the complaint was filed, Millcreek Township was home to approximately 2000 residents categorized by the US Census Bureau as \"Go Outside of Home-Disabled Residents, Noninstitutionalized,\" and 1000 residents in the category \"Sensory-Disabled Residents, Noninstitutionalized.\" The Plaintiffs alleged that members of the proposed class were segregated from full participation in Millcreek because of the lack of accessible sidewalks. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees.\n\nOn October 12, 2011, the court approved a Consent Decree and Partial Settlement between the Plaintiffs and Millcreek Township. PennDOT was not a party to this agreement. Millcreek agreed to ensure all future alterations to or construction of roads made by the Township would have ADA-compliant curb cuts at the intersections. Millcreek agreed to report all road work to the plaintiffs. The agreement contained provisions allowing exceptions where curb cuts were technically unfeasible. Millcreek also agreed to make a report of all newly constructed or altered roads dating back to January 1992 (when the ADA came into effect). The Plaintiffs and Millcreek agreed that they would meet and confer, when this list was completed, to determine a timetable for the retrofitting of these areas where necessary. The agreement acknowledged that Millcreek was not responsible for ensuring the compliance of state roads and highways running through the town. Millcreek agreed to pay $27,2479.97 in attorneys' fees and costs to the Plaintiffs. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Consent Decree.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the parties continued to negotiate for a total of four Consent Decrees and Partial Settlement orders between Plaintiffs and Millcreek Township. Additionally, the court approved three Partial Settlements between Plaintiffs and PennDOT. On November 23, 2016, the court approved a Joint Partial Settlement Agreement among all parties.  The Joint Partial Settlement Agreement resolved both of Plaintiff's claims (the Bus Stop claim and the Road Shoulder claim) and required Plaintiffs to make updates to existing infrastructure to comply with ADA requirements.  Additionally, the parties agreed that any sidewalk construction within Millcreek Township would comply with ADA guidelines.\n\nOn November 30, 2017, the parties proposed a fifth Consent Decree and Partial Settlement, which Judge Hornak approved on December 1, 2017. Under the fifth Consent Decree, the requirements of the four prior consent decrees remain in effect, with the additional incorporation of the Millcreek Transition Plan. The Transition Plan, consistent with the April 2017 preliminary agreement of the parties, identifies the \"remaining physical obstacles that limit accessibility of the facilities or park where Millcreek offers a program, service, or activity.\" It outlines and provides a timeline for the planned improvements and corrections to ensure that Millcreek's programs, services, and activities will be readily accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities.

{"document": "On December 13, 1996, parents of a student with autism filed this lawsuit on his behalf in the Eastern District Court of Arkansas. The plaintiffs sued the Arkansas Department of Education, the Williford School District, and individuals acting in their official capacities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Section 504, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest attorneys, asked the court for injunctive relief, including compensatory education for the student, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs claim that the Williford School District failed to implement any method of teaching to assist or promote the disabled students' learning. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that the student was not provided with an integrated and appropriate education that would meet state standards.\n\nThe plaintiff was diagnosed with autism at age 5, though the claims about his education begin with his enrollment in 7th grade. Plaintiff's parents claim that the school district failed to provide — and the state failed to oversee — an education that benefited the student. He was excluded altogether from Williford classrooms and schools, leaving him isolated from his peers. The plaintiff was only given \"home bound\" instruction, at a frequency well below the state's standards, and he was deprived of large parts of the high school curriculum. Furthermore, plaintiff's parents claim that the classes their son did take at the school — performance art and drawing — were pursued under their own initiative and required them to forego jobs and other necessities in order to assist the instructors in teaching their son. Additionally, the \"home bound\" instruction was primarily done on the computer, and required the parents to obtain the materials and teach their son themselves, instead of the district personnel. Plaintiffs claim that the defendants' treatment of the student deprived him of a proper education, and thus placed them in violation of the IDEA, ADA, and Section 504.\n\nIn a case proceeding the one at hand, the family complained to the Arkansas Department of Education about the student's education in an IDEA hearing. The family then complained to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) for a failure of due process. The DOE found that the Arkansas Department of Education delayed 3 of its 5 hearing decisions, ruling well beyond the 45 day limit. \n\nOn November 21, 1997, Judge Moody granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed the proceedings pending the 8th Circuit Court of Appeal's ruling on whether the 11th Amendment barred a federal court from having jurisdiction over an IDEA claim. The 8th Circuit held that Arkansas had waived its 11th Amendment immunity with respect to the IDEA claims by participating in the federal spending program, and the case was remanded to the district court. In December 1997 the plaintiff filed a cross-appeal, but the 8th Circuit dismissed his claim in September the following year.  \n\nIn November 2000 this case was consolidated with <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13401\"> Jim C. v.

Defendants appealed. On November 4, 2002, The 8th Circuit held that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden under Section 504, failing to show that school officials acted in bad faith or with gross misjudgment. Furthermore because the plaintiffs failed to ask for appropriate remedy under § 1983 and IDEA, the state officials were entitled to immunity. The 8th Circuit reversed Judge Moody's decision and remanded for further proceedings. On May 12, 2003, Judge Moody dismissed all claims for money damages against individual defendants.\n\nFollowing a trial, Judge Moody found that neither the state nor Williford School District violated the federal statutes. He held that the school district had developed a reasonable program to educate the plaintiff, and that, under the totality of the circumstances, had not created a hostile educational environment.

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that from 1996 to 2000, the defendants participated in and failed to take effective measures to remedy continuing and severe harassment that the student plaintiff experienced due to his sexual orientation.

{"document": "On October 26, 2010, a group of students with disabilities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against the Louisiana Department of Education and the Orleans Parish School Board. The plaintiffs, represented by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Southern Poverty Law Center, and private counsel alleged that the defendants acted and continued to act in violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) of 2004 (20 U.S.C. § 1400), § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (ADA) of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 794), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101). The plaintiffs sought to represent a class consisting of all New Orleans students with disabilities. \n\nPlaintiffs alleged that the New Orleans public schools had denied admission to students with disabilities; refused to evaluate needs for special education; failed to implement individualized education plans; and used abusive restraint techniques on students with disabilities. They sought a declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctions requiring the defendants to: (1) make their facilities and programs accessible to all students with disabilities; (2) adequately evaluate children with disabilities; (3) implement appropriate education accommodations; (4) and provide students with disabilities with a free appropriate public education.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, there was a hearing on the motion for class certification. The District Court (Judge Jay C. Zainey) ordered a stay for filing post-hearing briefs pending the outcome of settlement negotiations between the two parties.\n\nThe parties engaged in settlement negotiations during the spring and summer of 2014. On December 19, 2014, the parties submitted a proposed Consent Judgment. The Consent Judgment defined the affected class as present or future New Orleans students who have requested but not received a special education evaluation; have disabilities, attend charter schools, and have been removed from school for 10 days or more without the timely provision of the disciplinary safeguards required by IDEA; have not received services contained in their Individualized Education Plans; have a disability and have been denied admission or told not to apply to a public school because of their disability; or have mobility impairments and have been denied access to programs and services of New Orleans schools because of physical barriers. Judge Zainey issued preliminary approval of the Consent Judgment on January 8th, 2015. \n\nFollowing preliminary approval of the settlement, in early February, 2015, several parents of class members submitted objections to the Consent Judgment. Before the final hearing on the Judgment, plaintiffs' counsel met with those parents to discuss their concerns. On March 25, the court entered an order granting final approval of the Consent Judgment. \n\nThe Consent Judgment required schools to develop processes for finding and evaluating students with disabilities for special education services, implement special education services and related services, review and reform disciplinary policies, and educate charter schools about their legal obligation to enroll students with disabilities. It also dictated reporting requirements and appointed an Independent Monitor to periodically assess defendants' progress. The state would cover the costs of the Independent Monitor. It also provided for the State defendants to seek $700,000 in legislative appropriations to cover their share of plaintiff's attorneys' fees. Additionally, the intervenor defendants, the Orleans Parish School Board, would pay $100,000 to plaintiff's counsel for their share of attorneys' fees. \n\nThe Consent Judgment would remain in effect until the state achieved substantial compliance with each of the substantive provisions for two consecutive years. In a July 17, 2018 order regarding the status of the proceedings, the court noted that this meant defendants must first achieve substantial compliance and then maintain that compliance for an additional two consecutive years. The court also clarified that substantial compliance would be interpreted with regard to the compliance with the Consent Judgment itself, not individual compliance with the IDEA. \n\nThe August 9, 2018 monitoring report found that the defendants had been in substantial compliance with the Settlement Agreement's substantive provisions for the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 periods. But in response to an inquiry from the Southern Poverty Law Center, the monitors discovered substantial data errors which led to schools being improperly selected for monitoring. The independent monitors then identified the schools that were improperly subjected to monitoring and the schools that should have been monitored. Finally, the monitors recommended that in light of these errors, the parties meet and discuss an appropriate resolution for moving forward in compliance with the consent judgment.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly \"Alliance Defense Fund\"), a Christian non-profit organization, requested a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages.\n\nMore specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Westfield High School's policies and practices which prohibited and punished them for distributing religious literature, were discriminatory, content-based, vague, and acted as an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. The alleged discrimination began during the 2001-2002 school year, when the plaintiffs were denied permission to distribute candy canes along with a religious story of the candy cane and Bible verses, to students at the school during non-instructional time.

The plaintiff brought this lawsuit under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). It sued the U.S. Department of Education and the Secretary of Education along with the Acting Assistant Secretary, claiming that the changes to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights Case Processing Manual (“2018 OCR Manual”) violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and was contrary to the mission of the Office of Civil Rights (OCR). These changes in the 2018 OCR Manual included (1) new provisions to require mandatory dismissal and (2) the elimination of the appeal rights of complainants. \n\nIn effect, the newly revised 2018 OCR Manual meant that the OCR would dismiss claims of illegal discrimination if the claim was either part of \"a pattern\" of complaints against multiple recipients, or if the complaint placed an unreasonable burden on OCR's resources. \"Pattern\" was left undefined and could cover as little as two complaints. The provision was not even limited to those instances where prior complaints were meritless or where they would involve similar allegations. \"Unreasonable burden\" would also be judged based on unknown factors.  In addition, the DOE made a third change that eliminated complainants' right to appeal OCR findings of insufficient evidence. Thus, according to the plaintiff, the new restrictions would block those who had been subjected to more than one incident of illegal discrimination, and also those entities that represent multiple individuals that cannot afford to bring claims on their own. The plaintiffs stated this was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with the law, as this unilaterally eliminated the right of claimants to have their claim of discrimination investigated if it indicated a possible failure to comply with federal civil rights laws. As such, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorney’s fees. This case was assigned to Judge Theodore D. Chuang. \n\nOn December 3, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint naming the newly appointed Department of Education Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights.

Though the IEP projected services to commence with the school year, the school district delayed the start of IEP related services until the third week.

{"document": "In August 2006, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") filed this lawsuit against Eagle Produce L.L.C. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona alleging wage discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Specifically, the complaint alleged the defendant paid male Quality Control Inspectors more than female Inspectors ones despite their performance of substantially similar work duties. The complainants sought a permanent injunction ending the pay disparity and damages for the individual named plaintiffs. \n\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment. Eagle Productions argued that the EEOC lacked evidence to support its claims because the female employees did not perform work equal to that performed by the two comparative male employees. It further argued that the Title VII claim was time-barred. The EEOC sought summary judgment as to Eagle Produce’s statute of limitations defense, its laches defense, and its claim that one of the plaintiffs failed to mitigate her damages. \n\nOn June 6, 2008, Judge Neil Wake granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff and defendant’s motions for summary judgment. Specifically, he held that all claims for conduct prior to August 7, 2004 under both Title VII and the Equal Pay Act were barred because of the statute of limitations. All claims under the Equal Pay Act for conduct occurring after August 7, 2004 were still valid. This removed one complainant from the case.

{"document": "On December 29, 2004, employees of El Paso Corporation filed a lawsuit under ERISA and the ADEA against their employer in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief, claiming that changes made to their pension plans violated federal law.  Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that their pension plans were negatively impacted when El Paso Corporation changed to a cash balance formula for determining pension benefits.\n\nOn March 22, 2007, the court (Judge Walker Miller) dismissed one of the plaintiffs' claims under ERISA (Claim III) but denied the defendant's motion to dismiss on all other claims.

The court dismissed Claims II and IV; as a result, only Claims I and V remained.  Claim I alleged that the \"wear-away period\" in the pension plan violated the ADEA.  Claim V alleged that the Summary Plan Description violated ERISA section 102 (29 U.S.C. § 1022).  The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and conditionally approved the ADEA collective action on the condition that they resubmit a class definition in accord with the Court's dismissal of some of their claims. 2008 WL 762456 (D. Colo. Mar. 19, 2008).\n\nOn January 21, 2009, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider the dismissal of Claims II and IV.  The court also granted the defendant's motions for summary judgment on the ADEA claim, holding that it was time-barred because the conversion to a cash balance formula was a \"discrete act\" under Ledbetter v. Goodyear.  Further, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' remaining ERISA (alleging inadequate notice in the Summary Plan Description) claim because there was no evidence that the plaintiffs relied on the Summary Plan Description or that they suffered prejudice because of it.

In its opinion, the court explained that “wear-away” periods were caused by giving a transition period that employers were not obligated by law to give. The court refused to punish the defendants for giving a benefit it was not obligated to give in the first place. Second, the court recognized that the cash balance benefit continued to grow equally for everyone, irrespective of the age of the employee. Finally, the court noted that older workers had the option of choosing the “frozen” final average pay benefit rather than the cash balance benefit, if any employee found that to be more valuable. \n\nThe court also made clear that when employers make major changes to their pension plans they must give notice of those changes to employees. The court analyzed and approved the notices that the defendants sent out to its employees, making specific and detailed findings regarding what employers must include in Summary Plan Descriptions – and what they need not include – when changes are made to pension plans. \n\nOn December 22, 2011, the plaintiffs filed Petition for Writ of Certiorari, but it was denied on February 28, 2012.\n\nThis case is now closed.

{"document": "On September 29, 2011, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") brought this lawsuit against Beverage Distributors Company, LLC (\"BDC\") on behalf of a visually impaired company employee in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\") and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The EEOC claimed that BDC discriminated against the employee  when it conditioned his employment on the results of a medical exam and subsequently refused to hire him as a night warehouse loader upon learning that he had a disability. The EEOC asked the Court for a permanent injunction preventing BDC from discriminating on the basis of disability, reinstatement for the employee, compensatory and punitive damages, and back pay.\n\nThe employee has been legally blind since birth. He began working for BDC in 2003 as a driver's helper and performed well in that role. In early 2008, BDC informed him of its decision to eliminate the helper position and use contract labor to do the job instead. The employee was then offered a position as a night warehouse loader, but after the medical exam, the company rescinded the offer because it believed he could not drive a forklift safely, even though operating a forklift is not a job entry-level warehouse loaders perform. BDC also failed to engage in the ADA's required interactive process to determine whether it was possible to accommodate the employee in performing the job safely.\n\nBDC moved for summary judgment and invoked the ADA's \"direct-threat\" defense, contending that the employee could not perform the essential functions of the warehouse loader position and therefore would pose a \"direct threat\" to others in the workplace. The District Court (Judge Christine Arguello) denied the motion on December 7, 2012, because there were issues of material fact about whether BDC's decision was reasonable. <i>EEOC v. Beverage Distribs. Co.</i>, No. 11-cv-02557-CMA-CBS, 2012 WL 6094152 (D. Colo. Dec. 7, 2012). The EEOC also moved for summary judgment, and it was partially granted and partially denied. <i>EEOC v. Beverage Distribs. Co.</i>, No. 11-cv-02557-CMA-CBS, 2012 WL 6547782 (D. Colo. Dec. 14, 2012). Specifically, the District Court (Judge Arguello) rejected BDC's affirmative defense that the EEOC failed to conciliate in good faith before bringing suit. It also rejected the affirmative defenses of waiver, equitable estoppel, and unclean hands. The Court did, however, rule in favor of BDC in sustaining the affirmative defense of laches. It held that there remain issues of material fact about whether the three-year delay between the EEOC's investigation and its lawsuit was reasonable. Finally, the Court struck BDC's affirmative defense under which the company claimed that its due process rights would be violated if the Court did not bifurcate the trial to consider separately the EEOC's request for punitive damages. After pointing out that bifurcation is not an affirmative defense because it does not affect whether the defendant should be held liable, the Court declined to rule on the issue until a later date.\n\nFollowing a four-day trial in April, a jury agreed with the EEOC that BDC intentionally violated the ADA when it withdrew its job offer to the employee because of his impaired vision. The jury initially awarded $132,347 in back pay but found that his damages should be reduced by $102,803 because he could have mitigated those damages by finding a comparable position. 2013 WL 3829474. This is confirmed by the final judgment on April 15, 2013, and the amended final judgment on the same day. \n\nOn December 9, 2013, however, the District Court (Judge Arguello) vacated the jury's finding that the employee could have mitigated his damages, holding that BDC failed to prove there were any available comparable jobs that the employee could have performed. <i>EEOC v. Beverage Distribs. Co.</i>, No. 11-cv-02557-CMA-CBS, 2013 WL 6458735 (D. Colo. Dec. 9, 2013). In addition, the Court ordered BDC to hire the employee as a night warehouse loader with the same seniority that he would have had if BDC had not withdrawn the job offer due to his eyesight. The Court also indicated that, pending a hearing on the tax consequences of the award, the employee might be entitled to a tax penalty offset because of the lump-sum nature of the damages. Finally, the Court required BDC to hire an outside consultant to provide training and assistance in revisions to its policies, updates to its job postings, notice posting, and reporting and compliance review. BDC was required to report its compliance with this order to the Court within six months.\n\nBDC appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and subsequently asked the District Court to stay the requirement that it hire an outside consultant pending the outcome of the appeal. On November 1, 2014, the District Court (Judge Arguello) denied BDC's request, holding that it failed to meet its burden by showing that a stay was justified. <i>EEOC v. Beverage Distribs. Co.</i>, No. 11-cv-02557-CMA-CBS, 2014 WL 5591430 (D. Colo. Nov. 1, 2014).\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the Tenth Circuit (Judges Timothy M. Tymkovich, Jerome A. Holmes, and Robert E. Bacharach) reversed the district court, holding that the direct-threat jury instruction inaccurately conveyed the standard and therefore constituted reversible error. <i>EEOC v. Beverage Distribs. Co.</i>, 780 F.3d 1018 (10th Cir. 2015). More specifically, the Tenth Circuit held that the instruction erroneously required BDC to prove that the employee posed a direct threat when the company in fact had to prove only that it reasonably believed the job would pose such a threat. On the tax issue, however, the Tenth Circuit rejected BDC's argument that the district court erred in awarding a tax offset. That decision fell within the district court's discretion, and the employee may be entitled to an offset if the EEOC wins on retrial.\n\nOn April 30, 2015, the EEOC filed a petition for panel rehearing and/or rehearing en banc. The EEOC argued that the Court’s holding was inconsistent with its own precedent on evaluating jury instructions, as well as its past interpretations of the ADA. Specifically, it highlighted past 10th Circuit decisions that required proof that an employee posed a direct threat, not that the company reasonably believed as much. The 10th Circuit denied the petition for rehearing on May 27, 2015. \n\nOn December 4, 2015, Judge Arguello approved a consent decree between the parties. 2015 WL 10097367.  Judgment was entered against BDC for $160,000; $80,000 was for total back pay for the employee, and $80,000 was for compensatory damages. BDC was required to provide a letter of recommendation for the employee. In return, BDC was able to expunge the case and all related allegations of discrimination from its records. BDC was ordered to not engage in discrimination of the basis of disability, nor retaliate against employees who opposed an action because of its violation of the ADA. In consultation with an outside consultant, BDC was ordered to develop an anti-discrimination policy and reasonable accommodations guide, and to update its EEOC policy to be consistent with the ADA. It agreed to provide training for managers, human resources personnel, and employees, and to maintain detailed records and provide written reports to the EEOC for six months. Each party was responsible for its own attorneys’ fees and costs. \n\nThe decree had a two-year duration, and the matter appears to be closed as of March 2018.\n", "summary": "On September 29, 2011, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") brought this lawsuit against Beverage Distributors Company, LLC (\"BDC\") on behalf of a visually impaired company employee in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\").

Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Morgan Stanley discriminated against them in promotions, compensation, business, referrals, training, mentoring, and partnership agreements. The complaint requested to certify a class of \"[a]ll women employed by Morgan Stanley as financial advisers at any time between August 5, 2003 and the present.\" Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought: a declaratory judgment; front pay, benefits, back pay, compensatory and punitive damages; liquidated damages for the ADEA claim to the individual plaintiffs; injunctive relief barring Morgan Stanley from engaging in discriminatory practices and compelling them to develop new policies; and attorneys' fees, experts' fees, and costs.\n\nOn April 24, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement agreement. They filed two revised settlement agreements on July 11 and July 17, respectively. On October 1, 2007, the plaintiffs requested final approval of the settlement.\n\nOn October 26, 2007, District Judge Richard W. Roberts certified the class, approved the settlement agreement, and approved attorneys' fees and costs. The Court retained jurisdiction over administration of the settlement. The plaintiff class was defined as “all women who were employed as Financial Advisors or Registered Financial Advisor Trainees in the Global Wealth Management Group of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (“Morgan Stanley”) or its predecessor(s) at any time from August 5, 2003 through June 30, 2007.” \n\nThe agreement contained a five-year enforcement period and required the defendant to pay $46 million, $32.5 million of which was allocated for class members' claims and $13.5 million for attorneys' fees, costs as well as monitoring and compliance. A special master was appointed to determine class members' awards based on their contributions to the defendant's business, the discrimination they faced, and other factors according to a formula detailed in the settlement. \n\nThe injunctive relief included distribution of an anti-harassment policy to all employees; posting positions on an internal job bank; establishing objective promotion and hiring criteria; implementing diversity training; revising the \"power ranking\" system that ranks financial advisors' production; changing account distribution and referral policies; implementing a complaint process; and other changes. The parties also agreed to appoint a diversity monitor who would report semi-annually to class counsel and to appoint industrial psychologists to develop programs to recruit and promote more women.\n\nOnly September 19, 2011, the parties jointly proposed to seek transfer of a related case from the Northern District of California to this court for consideration of a proposed consolidated settlement agreement. Judge Roberts approved the consolidation on December 8, 2011 and administratively closed Amochaev v. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. [Case No. C-051298 (PJH)]. The parties filed a consolidated settlement agreement on June 22, 2012.\n\nOn February 15, 2013, Judge Roberts approved the consolidated class action settlement agreement.

{"document": "On October 29, 2001, more than 250 African-American current or former U.S. Capitol Police Officers filed this race discrimination lawsuit under the Congressional Accountability Act (\"CAA\"), 2 U.S.C. § 1311, against the United States Capitol Police Board in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs also included claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the disproportionately low number of African-Americans in the police force and in leadership positions within the force demonstrated rampant racial discrimination. Even though African-Americans comprised more than 60% of the D.C. general population, they made up only 31% of the police force and 16% of ranking positions. The plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and injunctive relief.\n\nOn September 30, 2004, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted the police boards' motion to dismiss the complaint. Judge Sullivan held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not cover legislative branch employees. Therefore, he held that the plaintiffs could only bring suit under the CAA to challenge employment discrimination. This too was barred because the court only had subject matter jurisdiction over claims in which the plaintiff completed counseling and mediation regarding the alleged violation within the time limits specified by the CAA. Although several plaintiffs had requested mediation, they had failed to participate. Judge Sullivan held that such actions could not satisfy the \"completing mediation\" requirement within the CAA, but he granted the plaintiffs the opportunity to file a motion for reconsideration if they properly complied. 338 F.Supp.2d 97.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider on January 14, 2005. Judge Sullivan denied their motion without prejudice on August 4, 2005, in an unpublished order. He referred the issue to Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola to determine whether any individual class members were entitled to relief.\n\nThroughout 2006, there was extensive litigation over the plaintiffs' attorneys' motions to withdraw as counsel to individual plaintiffs who had failed to pay or communicate with attorneys. These motions were denied and granted in part as to certain plaintiffs. 2006 WL 891163; 2007 WL 841019. The case was also consolidated with several others against the Police Board.\n\nMagistrate Judge Facciola issued a Report and Recommendation on March 19, 2007, in which he lamented the plaintiffs' failure to comply with Judge Sullivan's September 30, 2004, order requiring parties to clearly demonstrate their compliance with counseling and mediation as demanded under the CAA. Magistrate Judge Facciola noted that much of the evidence subsequently provided by plaintiffs was either inconsistent or insufficient. It was therefore only a \"place to start.\" Based on the evidence provided, he:<ol><li>dismissed with prejudice claims where the plaintiffs had clearly failed to exhaust administrative remedies;</li><li>dismissed without prejudice claims where the plaintiffs seemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies, but failed to provide the court with sufficient evidence; and,</li><li>upheld claims where the plaintiffs had clearly exhausted administrative remedies.</li></ol>2007 WL 841019. On May 15, Magistrate Judge Facciola dismissed with prejudice the second group after the plaintiffs had failed to provide supporting documents to demonstrate compliance with the CAA. 2007 WL 1438763. On August 15, 2007, the Court adopted the recommendations of Magistrate Judge Facciola, thereby dismissing with prejudice a substantial number of the remaining claims. 2007 WL 6847408.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued its opinion on July 31, 2009. The case was heard before Judge David Bryan Sentelle, Judge Douglas Ginsburg, and Judge Judith Rogers. There were three aspects of the district court's ruling at issue: (1) whether the three-step process requiring counseling and mediation before an employee could file a complaint was jurisdictional, (2) whether in-person attendance by the employee was required at counseling or mediation, and (3) whether receipt of end of counseling and mediation notices demonstrated completion of counseling and mediation. The Court of Appeals (with the opinion written by Judge Rogers) affirmed the district court's ruling with respect to whether the three-step process was jurisdictional, holding that it was. Yet, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court's in-person ruling, holding that the CAA did not require in-person attendance by the employee at counseling or mediation. Lastly, the Court of Appeals held that receipt from the Office of Compliance of written notice of the end of mediation did demonstrate the employee's completion of counseling and mediation. The case was then remanded. 575 F.3d 699.\n\nOn May 10, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a Joint Fourth Amended Class Action Complaint, re-alleging that the defendant had violated the CAA and that the action was properly maintainable as a class action under FRCP 23(a). On August 12, 2010, the defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint, alleging lack of jurisdiction. While awaiting the court's ruling, the parties continued to dispute discovery matters. On March 9, 2012, the court referred the case again to Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola for resolution of defendant's motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint. On December 14, 2012, the Magistrate Judge Facciola issued a report and recommendation regarding whether the complaint should be dismissed. In it, Magistrate Judge Facciola noted that vast majority of the plaintiffs should be dismissed for failure to exhaust their administrative remedies as required under the CAA, while the plaintiffs who submitted enough evidence of exhaustion should proceed past the motion to dismiss (\"Appendix II\"), and the rest of remaining plaintiffs should be dismissed with prejudice. Finally, Magistrate Judge Facciola identified five plaintiffs for whom additional clarification was necessary. Both parties responded and objected to the Magistrate Judge Facciola’s report and recommendation.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, the plaintiffs sought to amend or correct the amended complaint. The defendant opposed the motion, and the court did not issue an order on the matter. From September 2013 through April 2015 there was no activity on the docket. On April 21, 2015, counsel for the plaintiffs moved for a hearing on a motion to withdraw. In a May 1, 2015, minute order, the court ordered the plaintiffs to file a motion to withdraw, and Judge Sullivan temporarily stayed the case to allow the plaintiff time to acquire new counsel.\n\nHearings were rescheduled several times throughout 2015 and 2016. On October 13, 2016, U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan issued a memorandum opinion resolving the plaintiffs' objections to Magistrate Judge Facciola's dismissal of most of their claims, and the plaintiff's motion to file a fifth amended complaint. Judge Sullivan adopted in part and rejected in part Magistrate Judge Facciola's recommendations, thereby dismissing many, but not all, of the plaintiffs' claims on jurisdictional grounds. He also denied the plaintiffs' motion to file a fifth amended complaint. On February 14, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration on one of the claims Judge Sullivan dismissed, which was denied on March 30, 2018.\n\nOn February 19, 2019, one plaintiff filed a motion for appointment of a mediator to assist in the mediation of settlement discussion of all claims by this plaintiff. The court also agreed to provide court-appointed counsel for the pro se plaintiffs during the mediation phase.\n\nBy July 30, 2019, one plaintiff was represented by private counsel and the other eight represented themselves pro se. On that day, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendant's August 12, 2010, motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction for the reasons laid out in the October 13, 2016, memorandum opinion. The plaintiffs moved for reconsideration on August 21, 2019.\n\nIn their August 27, 2019 status report, the plaintiffs stated that the defendant's counsel had been unresponsive to communication from the plaintiffs. At the end of 2019, and again at the end of 2020, the defendant found new counsel.\n\nThe court granted the plaintiff's August 21, 2019 motion for reconsideration on March 18, 2021. The court also denied without prejudice the individual plaintiff's motion for mediation from February 19, 2019, wanting to wait until the court ruled on the defendant's anticipated motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. \n\nThe case is ongoing.", "summary": "This case was brought by several African-American current or former U.S. Capitol Police Officers against the United States Capitol Police Board.

{"document": "On December 19, 2005, former employees of the Boeing Company filed this class action in the United States District Court of Kansas against Boeing, Spirit Aerosystems Inc., the Onex Corporation, and Midwestern Aircraft. The employees alleged violations of various laws during the layoff and rehire process that took place in connection with Boeing's sale of its commercial airplane manufacturing facilities to Onex. In 2005, Boeing sold its Wichita and Oklahoma facilities to Onex, which created Spirit as a subsidiary specifically for the purpose of purchasing the facilities. As part of the sale, Boeing terminated all employees at those facilities in two mass layoffs in May and June of 2005. Some but not all of those laid-off employees were then hired by Spirit. Those not hired by Spirit filed this lawsuit, alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA), the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, and class certification.\n\nRepresented by private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that Boeing's layoff process started in 2002 as part of a plan to reduce the average age and wage of its workforce in order to make the facilities more attractive to potential buyers. The plaintiffs asked the court to certify a class of all former Wichita or Oklahoma facility employees who were terminated or laid off by Boeing and not re-hired by Onex and who were over age 40 or older on the date of termination, layoff, or non-hire. On February 27, 2006, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all claims against Midwestern, leaving Boeing, Spirit and Onex as the only co-defendants. And on November 15, 2006, the District Court (Judge Monti L. Belot) granted the plaintiffs' motion for conditional class certification and notice under the ADEA. On December 18, 2006, the Court granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings in part and dismissed the plaintiffs' recordkeeping and OWBPA claims.\n\nThe defendants moved for partial summary judgment; on October 30, 2007, the Court found that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and dismissed both the ADEA claim stemming from conduct that occurred prior to January 1, 2005 and the retaliation claim. 2007 WL 3231526. Because the Court ruled that the ADEA claims could only be granted from January 1, 2005, part of the previously certified class was dismissed as well. The claims remaining after these dismissals were the ADEA claim for conduct after January 1, 2005, the ERISA claim, and the LMRA claim.\n\nDuring the discovery process, the plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint to dismiss all claims against Onex and add factual allegations and a civil conspiracy claim. The defendants opposed the plaintiffs' citation to documents protected by an agreed protective order and argued that the conspiracy claim was futile. On May 21, 2008, the Court (Magistrate Judge Karen M. Humphreys) ordered the parties to confer on the discovery issues and granted the plaintiffs' motion in part but denied them leave to add the conspiracy claim. The claims against Onex were dismissed on June 24, 2008, while claims against Boeing and Spirit remained.  <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detailDocument.php?id=52041\">2008 WL 191418</a> (D.

The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration and asked the Court for additional time for discovery, which was denied on March 28, 2011. 2011 WL 1118835 (D. Kan. Mar. 28, 2011). The only claim remaining was the disparate treatment claim under the ADEA. The plaintiffs appealed the Court's two summary judgment decisions and the denial of reconsideration to the Tenth Circuit, which affirmed the lower court's decision. 691 F.3d 1184 (10th Cir. 2012).\n\nOn December 6, 2012, the plaintiffs requested an order to determine whether the single file rule applied based on this Court's decision and subsequent affirmation by the Tenth Circuit, determine the date that the statute of limitations began to run again, and toll that date by 90 days after the Court's ruling. Both parties jointly filed a motion to sever the pro se plaintiffs for their individual ADEA claims of disparate treatment, which was granted by the Court on January 10, 2013.

Judge Melgren held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on October 22, 2015, and the plaintiffs failed to appear at the hearing. On January 7, 2015, Judge Melgran denied the motion on costs and granted the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the remaining 26 plaintiffs had repeatedly failed to comply with discovery requests or adequately participate in the proceedings; the court had warned that if they continued to fail to comply, the case would be dismissed. 2015 WL 93653.\n\nOn February 9, 2015, the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the Tenth Circuit. However, this appeal was not filed timely and the plaintiffs were forced to file a motion allowing a late appeal citing a personal emergency.

They also sought an order to permanently enjoin the defendants from enforcing the Transgender Service Member Ban, in addition to attorney’s fees.  \n\nThe plaintiffs comprised a group of transgender individuals that, under the Open Service Directive, publicly revealed their transgender status and were receiving medically necessary treatments related to their gender transition. The complaint alleged that President Trump’s memorandum entitled “Military Service by Transgender Individuals” set aside the Open Service Directive and replaced it with a policy that contained animus against transgender individuals. The complaint singled out the policy directives that rescinded protection against discharge of existing service members, banned new enlistments and commission, and banned medically necessary care. The plaintiffs claimed these directives directly violate their Fifth Amendment rights and discriminated against each of the plaintiffs and other service members who identified as transgender on the basis of sex. \n\nOn September 14, 2017, the plaintiffs filed for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants from enforcing President Trump’s memorandum until final judgment was given on the case. On November 21, 2017, Judge Marvin Garbis granted the preliminary injunction because the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Equal Protection claims against the three policy directives and the claims under due process were sufficiently plausible to withstand dismissal. Judge Garbis also dismissed the plaintiffs' cause of action under 10 U.S.C § 1074 without prejudice. 280 F.Supp.3d 747.\n\nThe defendants filed an appeal against the preliminary injunction on December 6, 2017 to the Fourth Circuit and later filed a motion for clarification and stay in the appeals court and the district court. The motions for clarification and stay were denied in both courts. Following, the defendants filed a voluntary dismissal motion for their appeal of the preliminary injunction on December 29, 2017 and the court approved soon after. \n\nBack in district court, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and motion to partially dissolve the preliminary injunction on March 1, 2018. The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint and removed the 10 U.S.C § 1074 claim on April 27.\n\nOn May 11, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, and motion for summary judgment. On May 25, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. \n\nIn June of 2018, Judge Garvis retired, and the case was reassigned to Judge George Russell III on July 18, 2018.\n\nOn March 1, 2019, the defendants told the court that they would shortly file a petition for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The writ of mandamus would request the appellate court to direct the district court to stay its nationwide preliminary injunction of November 21, 2017 because the Supreme Court stayed two nationwide injunctions in two similar cases on January 22, 2019. \n\nJudge Russell issued an opinion on the writ of mandamus on March 7, 2019. He stayed the preliminary injunction based on the Supreme Court's decision to stay a nationwide injunction on the transgender military ban in <i> Stockman v. Trump</i> and <i>Karnoski v. Trump</i>. The plaintiffs attempted to suspend the stay as it relates to their individual cases, but Judge Russell did not agree with this motion, because the <i>Stockman</i> and <i>Karnoski</i> decisions attempted the same argument, and the Supreme Court rebuffed it. 2019 WL 5697228.\n\nThe defendants filed a notice with the court on June 18, 2019 that the Ninth Circuit had issued an opinion regarding the stayed nationwide injunction on the transgender service ban in <i>Karnoski v. Trump</i> (for more on the <i>Karnoski</i> case, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16119\">here</a>. In that opinion, the Ninth Circuit vacated the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington's order striking the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction because the revised 2018 policy was significantly different from the 2017 guidance that inspired the injunction. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the district court to review if the revisions warranted dissolution of the preliminary injunction. Back in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, the defendants used this opinion to support their arguments put forth in their motions to dismiss and extend the stay of the preliminary injunction. In addition, the defendants moved for reconsideration of the motion to stay portions of discovery based on this opinion on June 27.\n\nJudge Russell ruled on various outstanding motions on August 20, 2019. He granted the defendant's motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction, writing that while the 2018 policy makes serving in the military while transgender more difficult, the new policy is not a blanket ban like the one the injunction was intended to correct. Using a similar argument, Judge Russell dismissed all of the plaintiffs' claims related to the 2017 policy as moot. In addition, he found several of the current plaintiffs lack standing; the 2018 policy imposes restrictions on those seeking to join the military, not those that are already in, and many of the plaintiffs were already in the military. However, he refused to dismiss the plaintiff's equal protection claims, and allowed for discovery to continue on the issue. Similarly, he dismissed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, looking to further discovery to settle the issues. 400 F.Supp.3d 317.\n\nJudge Russell turned to the defendant's motion for reconsideration on September 3, granting it in part and denying it in part. He denied the motion to stay discovery, saying that it would only be necessary if the defendants sought review at the Fourth Circuit, which they have not petitioned for at this time. However, he granted the motion for reconsideration on the level of deference various military documents found in discovery will be given. 402 F.Supp.3d 153.\n\nAfter these discovery disputes were settled, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on November 6, 2019. The new complaint amended the factual allegations section to account for new developments since the case started, focusing on stigmatic injuries associated with serving as a transgender service member. \n\nDiscovery in the case is ongoing. ", "summary": "On August 28, 2017, six transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland Maryland contesting the President's ban on transgender service in the U.S. military. Judge Garbis initially granted a motion for a preliminary injunction in September, but this was later stayed in 2019 when the Supreme Court issued a stay of this nationwide injunction in two factually similar cases contesting the ban. \r\n\r\nThis case changed dramatically in 2018 when the government altered its policy on transgender service in the military, eliminating an outright ban and instead putting new guidance on transgender men and women entering the service. Judge Russell, reassigned to the case in 2018, dissolved the preliminary injunction, saying that it was only meant to stay a complete ban on transgender service in the military. This also dismissed all claims against the 2017 outright ban as moot, and removed all plaintiffs that were already in the service and not seeking to join. Discovery is ongoing in the case."}
{"document": "This case is about racial discrimination in employment and retaliation for employees filing Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) complaints.  Three Pocomoke City, Maryland police officers brought this lawsuit on January 20, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against Pocomoke City, the Pocomoke City Police Department, the Worcester County Sheriff’s Office, the Department of Maryland State Police, and a number of individuals associated with these organizations. Represented by private counsel, the Washington Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and the ACLU of Maryland, the officers sued under 42 U.S.C §§ 1981, 1983, and 1985, and the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as front and back pay, damages for physical and psychological harms, and attorneys’ fees. The officers alleged that they were subjected to a hostile environment because of their race. They also alleged that two of the officers were fired in retaliation for filing EEOC complaints against their employer. The officers asserted that the racial discrimination and retaliation they suffered while employed by the Pocomoke City Police Department violated their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge J. Frederick Motz. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on January 27, 2016. On March 16, 2016, the officers filed an amended complaint, changing the named defendants. In mid-April of 2016, the defendants again moved to dismiss the complaint. In June, Judge Motz granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted against the defendants in their official capacities under U.S.C §§ 1981 and 1983 and against defendant Wells as to the plaintiffs’ retaliation claim. Two months later, Judge Motz also dismissed the claims against Worcester County State’s Attorney Beau Oglesby, holding that they were barred by the doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity.\n\nOn September 29, 2016, the officers filed a final amended complaint, adding the State of Maryland as a defendant. Shortly thereafter, the United States Department of Justice moved to intervene in the case, filing an intervenor complaint against Pocomoke City, the Worcester County Sheriff, and Maryland to enforce the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. Before and after the intervenor complaint, the defendants again moved for dismissal or summary judgment. Judge Motz granted the United States’ motion to intervene and denied the defendants’ motions to dismiss on March 20, 2017, without clearly explaining his reasoning. On May 15, 2017, Judge Motz denied motions by both the State of Maryland and the plaintiffs for reconsideration of his earlier decisions on motions to dismiss or for summary judgment. Both parties sought an interlocutory appeal. The State of Maryland filed a motion to stay pending appeal, which was granted by Judge Motz on August 3.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision to dismiss the charges against Oglesby on the basis of prosecutorial immunity. 896 F.3d 260. It reversed the decision of the District Court with regard to the State of Maryland, holding that the plaintiff had failed to make a Title VII retaliation claim against the State’s Attorney and could therefore not make a Title VII claim against Oglesby’s employer. On remand, the case was reassigned to Judge Ellen L. Hollander, who promptly dismissed the Title VII complaint against the State of Maryland.\n\nAfter almost two years of on and off settlement talks, two of the officers notified the court that they had accepted settlement offers from Pocomoke City on March 27, 2019. The judgment included a consent decree enforceable for three years requiring the Pocomoke City Police Department to refrain from engaging in racial discrimination and retaliatory practices, to adopt or amend written policies and procedures to ensure proper handling of discrimination complaints and prohibit retaliation against individuals raising or participating in the investigation or litigation of such claims, and to provide training, at its own cost, to its employees on these policies and procedures. In addition, the settlement awarded monetary damages in the amount of $450,001.00 to one of the plaintiffs and $200,001.00 to the other, in addition to attorneys’ fees. Defendant also agreed to provide neutral references for the officers to any potential employers.\n\nA second settlement conference was held on May 2, 2019. On December 4, 2019, the remaining parties agreed to a settlement by consent decree. The terms of the December 2019 settlement are unknown at this time. As of September 30, 2020, the case is ongoing, but stayed pending consent motions to amend the earlier settlement.\n", "summary": "In 2016, three Pocomoke City, Maryland police officers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.

{"document": "In December 2013, the Detroit field office of the EEOC brought this suit against Guardsmark in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The complaint alleged that an employee who worked as a security guard for Guardsmark observed a co-worker using the security cameras to zoom in on women's private parts on a number of occasions. He complained to the co-worker and also informed a female victim. After that incident, he was discharged by his employer. EEOC alleged that Guardsmark deprived the employee of equal employment opportunities. EEOC asked the court for: (a) a permanent injunction enjoining Guardsmark from engaging in sexual discrimination and perpetuating a sexual hostile work environment, and retaliating against any employee who opposes such behaviors; (b) an order requiring Guardsmark to institute and carry out policies, practices and programs that provide equal employment opportunities; (c) to order Guardsmark to compensate the discharged employee; and (d) to pay punitive damages. The employee also filed his complaint against Guardsmark as an intervenor plaintiff claiming loss and damages. \n\nIn 2015, motions for partial summary judgment were put before the court by the EEOC, plaintiff-intervenor, and defendant. On April 8, 2016, District Judge Victoria A. Roberts denied all of them. \n\nIn its motion for summary judgment, Guardsmark argued plaintiffs did not have standing because Title VII does not protect employees from retaliation for opposing discrimination against non-employees. The Court found Plaintiff had standing because a reasonable worker might be dissuaded from opposing sexually inappropriate conduct in the workplace if he knew that he would be fired. Whether or not the underlying claim of sexual harassment had merit is unimportant the Court stated, because the employee engaged in protected activity by opposing what he believed was unlawful sexual harassment by another security guard.\nThe EEOC and plaintiff-intervenor sought summary judgment because they had presented direct evidence of discrimination and retaliation and there were no issues of fact remain to be decided. The Court denied their motions because it found that genuine issues of material fact remained, including whether Guardsmark knew at the time plaintiff-intervenor was removed, that he had engaged in protected activity, and whether Guardsmark’s business reasons for removing plaintiff-intervenor from his position were sufficient to warrant removal or were instead pretextual. \n\nMeanwhile, the parties had been engaged in settlement negotiations, which led to a consent decree on September 9, 2016, which the Court approved the same day. \n\nThe consent decree was to last one year. It provided that Guardsmark would not retaliate against any employee who opposed discriminatory practices made unlawful by Title VII, filed a charge of discrimination or assisted or participated in the filing of such a charge, or assisted or participates in an investigation or proceeding brought under federal laws prohibiting discrimination or retaliation. Additionally, Guardsmark would post a notice for one year informing readers that retaliation and discrimination were illegal under Title VII and listing the EEOC's contact number. Guardsmark would also pay $115,000 in monetary relief to plaintiff-intervenor: $36,641.80, in back pay, $36,641.80 in compensatory damages, and $41,716.40 in attorneys’ fees. Guardsmark also agreed to provide training to employees on sexual harassment and retaliation. \n\nAn amended consent decree, with no significant changes, was entered on September 16, 2016.

{"document": "On May 25, 2007, employees terminated by the defendant, Seagate, LLC, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 USC §2201.  Plaintiffs, represented by private attorneys, asked the court for declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act relating to the enforceability of a purported release and waiver signed by many of the Plaintiffs upon their termination. Plaintiffs claimed that they were subjected to adverse treatment in the terms, conditions, and privileges of their employment and termination due to their age. \n\nPlaintiffs also alleged that they did not knowingly and voluntarily waive their ADEA claims because the signed releases were invalid under the OWBPA, which sets specific criteria for effective written releases of federal age discrimination claims. The plaintiffs claimed that among other defects, the releases misrepresented the number of employees selected for termination, omitted employees from the list of those selected for termination, were not written in a manner reasonably calculated to be understood by the average employee, and failed to disclose the selection criteria and eligibility factors used to select individuals for termination.  Plaintiffs claimed they suffered actual damages in the form of lost salary and wages,  retirement and insurance benefits, and other forms of compensation reasonably believed to exceed $100,000 per plaintiff. \n\nThe claim is pursuant to events in 2004, when Seagate laid off employees at its Normandale and Shakopee facilities in Minnesota. It gave the terminated workers severance benefits conditioned on the signing of a release that purported to waive any age discrimination claims against the employer. Plaintiffs claimed that they were asked to sign the releases immediately, without allowing them to consider it or to consult with an attorney, and that a Seagate Human Resources employee stood at the door of the facility to collect the signed releases from the terminated employees. \n\nTwo of the terminated employees who did not sign releases filed the age discrimination charges with EEOC. Some 19 additional plaintiffs joined the plaintiffs in the ADEA class suit, even though they had signed releases and never filed EEOC charges. The court also said the administrative charges filed by the plaintiffs referred to the 2004 terminations and indicated that the pair were bringing charges on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated employees over age 40 that Seagate had terminated.\n\nOn November 20, 2007, Seagate submitted a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that those 19 plaintiffs lack any claim for declaratory relief under the OWBPA or for individual relief under the ADEA. The company contended the waivers are valid as a matter of law, fully compliant with the OWBPA's requirements, and effectively block the plaintiffs' ADEA claims. Seagate also contended that plaintiffs who did not file EEOC charges may not seek individual relief under the ADEA. Seagate contended that its written release form complied with the OWBPA and specified that terminated employees had 45 days in which to decide to sign, as required by the act. The company argued that the plaintiffs are imposing a \"hypertechnical statutory application\" in interpreting the releases. Seagate contended that the pressure plaintiffs reported was \"nothing more than the reality that eligibility for separation benefits was lawfully conditioned on signing the releases.\" \n\nObserving that plaintiffs' allegations must be accepted as true at the motion to dismiss stage, Judge Michael J. Davis denied Seagate's motion regarding the validity of the releases under OWBPA. He pointed out that under relevant case law, an effective release must comply with each OWBPA prerequisite and that \"substantial compliance\" with the act's requirements is \"not adequate.\" The plaintiffs may proceed with their bid for a declaratory judgment that the releases are invalid under OWBPA and therefore do not block their age bias claims, the court decided. \n\nOn January 22, 2008, defendants moved for an order to certify, for interlocutory appeal, the November 20, 2007 denial of their motion to dismiss. Defendants sought certification on two grounds: whether the plaintiffs had properly exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to their age discrimination claims, and whether the Special Incentive Retirement Plan (SIRP) release that a plaintiff signed is valid and enforceable. On February 14, 2008, Judge Davis denied the motion for certification, stating that the defendants were simply challenging the Court's application of settled law. Judge Davis also stated that the defendants failed to demonstrate substantial grounds for a difference of opinion warranting interlocutory relief. \n\nOn May 28, 2008, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment as to the invalidity of the releases signed by the employees upon their termination. Under the OWBPA, an individual cannot waive any right or claim under the ADEA unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary.  Some of the terms were different for waivers that involved \"reduction in force\" (RIF) releases. Some of the terminated employees signed RIF releases, and others signed Special Incentive Employment Program (SIRP) releases. 154 employees were affected by the RIF at the Normandale facility. The RIF releases were declared invalid because they failed to disclose the proper required information of all terminated employees at the Normandale facility with respect to the 2004 RIF, they were unintelligible, and they prohibited signers from filing EEOC charges, all of which violate the OWBPA. Judge Davis declared that the releases offered to those plaintiffs terminated pursuant to the 2004 RIF were invalid as a matter of law.\n\nOn October 23, 2008, Judge Davis granted plaintiffs' motion to authorize notice to potential class members, which consisted of all individuals who were employed by defendants in any United States location and who were 40 years of age or more on the date in 2004 when defendants offered them a retirement separation agreement or a termination separation agreement.\n\nOn February 8, 2011, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to the invalidity of the 2004 SIRP releases because they violated the 45-day consideration period for such releases under federal law. Then, on August 15, 2011, the defendants' motion for decertification was granted in part and denied in part. The court declared that only those plaintiffs terminated through RIF may proceed as a collective action. This was because the SIRP was a separate employment action that was different in scope, communication and effect than the RIF, and employees terminated through one program are not similarly situated to those employees terminated from the other program. Seagate also asserted that the SIRP was intended as a voluntary program, while the RIF was involuntary, so the employees who volunteered to participate in SIRP suffered no adverse employment action and were thus not similarly situated with the RIF plaintiffs. Taking into consideration the relevant factors in determining whether to decertify a class--age variance, type of termination, division in the company in which they worked, employment status, supervisors and salaries--the Court found that employees terminated through SIRP were not similarly situated with employees terminated through RIF. Thus, the defendants' motion for decertification was granted for the plaintiffs who signed the SIRP releases. \n\nWith respect to the RIF program, the court held that at this stage, the plaintiffs have met their burden of putting forth sufficient evidence that age discrimination may have been the standard operating procedure with respect to those employees selected for termination through the RIF, and defendants' motion to decertify was denied with respect to employees who signed the RIF releases.\n\nAdditionally, on August 15, 2011, defendants' motion for partial summary judgment as to plaintiffs' disparate impact claim was granted.\n\nOn September 29, 2011, the court dismissed without prejudice the claims of 9 plaintiffs who had signed the SIRP releases. Then, on November 15, 2011, the parties reached a settlement. On January 24, 2012, the parties stipulated that the case be dismissed with prejudice. The case was then dismissed with prejudice on January 26, 2012.", "summary": "Plaintiffs filed an age discrimination action against Seagate US, LLC.

The EEOC alleged that Defendant, Bodega Bars, engaged in unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex.  Specifically, the EEOC claimed that the two female employees were subjected to egregious sexual harassment by one of Defendant's customers, and Defendant did not take appropriate corrective action despite the employees' repeated complaints.  Furthermore, the propositions, touching, and graphic sexual comments by the customer allegedly created a sexually hostile work environment for the employees that was so oppressive that they were forced to resign their employment.

", "summary": "This 2017 lawsuit was brought by three detectives of the NYPD in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs claimed that the City of New York and various agents of the NYPD had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by implementing a secretive policy of refusing to promote deserving African American detectives solely based on race.

{"document": "On December 1, 2017, seven Black employees of the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) filed this class-action lawsuit against the City of New York in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs alleged racial discrimination in FDNY’s hiring, promotion, and compensation practices and sought compensatory damages, in the form of back and front pay as well as lost benefits. Additionally, the employees sought attorney’s fees and costs and injunctive relief in the form of internal agency policy changes. Represented by Valli Kane & Vagnini based in New York and Mehri & Skalet based in Washington, D.C., the employees sued under 42 U.S. § 1981 and § 1983, alleging that FDNY disproportionately hires few Black people relative to other City agencies and fosters a culture of managerial discretion that leads to favoritism and harms Black candidates seeking promotions or pay raises. Additionally, the employees sued under New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL) for the same alleged racial discrimination. Judge James Paul Oetken was assigned to the case. On October 29, 2018, the case was automatically referred to mediation. Only once – on May 23, 2019 – has a mediation session actually been held.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class certification with respect to three groups: (1) Black FDNY workers who have been employed in a civilian position at any level below Department Leader and Black applicants who met the requirements listed in FDNY’s job postings yet; (2) Black FDNY workers who have been employed in a civilian position at any level below Department Leader; and (3) Black FDNY workers employed as EMS lieutenants. \n\nOn January 9, 2018, one plaintiff withdrew their claims against the defendant. This individual was the only named plaintiff representing the EMS class.\n\nOn February 11, 2018, the City moved to dismiss the FDNY employees’ complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted. On September 28, 2018, the City’s motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part. Judge Oetken dismissed the employees’ claims related to the EMS employees. Judge Oetken additionally dismissed the employees’ claims under § 1981 and NYCHRL related to compensation and for occurrences prior to December 1, 2014 because the three-year statute of limitations on these claims had passed. However, the City’s motion to dismiss was denied with respect to the claims relating to hiring and promotion practices within the FDNY. While the motion was considered, the Court stayed discovery, but fact discovery began shortly after, with the parties agreeing to a case management plan on November 27, 2018. Discovery ended on December 20, 2019.\n\nPlaintiffs filed a motion in response to amend their complaint on November 13, 2018, in order to address the deficiencies in the complaint, as the Court found it. This motion was granted on April 8, 2019. The employees filed their amended complaint on April 25, 2019. The amended complaint listed eight plaintiffs – five from the original filing and three new parties. In the amended complaint, the FDNY employees supplemented their pleading with additional information regarding pay disparities that analyzed a broader range of positions with FDNY. The employees also modified the sought classes to be (a) Black employees of FDNY that made below $150,000 and were not in administrator or manager positions and (b) Black applicants who possessed the requirements for non-administrator, non-manager positions within FDNY and were rejected. Within the former class, the employees listed a further subclass of employees who worked in Professional or Management Specialist positions to whom claims of pay raise or compensation disparities applied.\n\nThe City moved for partial summary judgment on May 26, 2020, arguing that some of the class representatives had retired and thus could not seek injunctive or declaratory relief and that other plaintiffs could represent specific classes. The City additionally sought to strike claims relating to disparate impact class allegations pertaining to any policies that afforded employees within the FDNY to have discretion over hiring, promotion, or compensation decisions. On the same day, the FDNY employees moved to certify the class. As of February 11, 2021, the motions for partial summary judgment and class certification remained pending. This case is ongoing.\n\n", "summary": "Current and former Black FDNY employees sued the City of New York alleging racial discrimination in their hiring, promotion, and compensation practices. Plaintiffs sought to represent a class of individuals similarly situated who suffered from FDNY's policies that afforded too much discretion to higher-level individuals and fostered a culture of favoritism that harmed Black candidates for hiring and advancement.  The City filed a motion to dismiss and the Court partially granted the motion, but sustained the plaintiffs' claims related to the hiring and promotion practices with the FDNY. The City moved for partial summary judgment in May 2020, arguing that the retired class representatives could not seek relief. At the same time, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. Both motions were pending as of February 11, 2021."}
{"document": "The Philadelphia district office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) brought this suit against Pitt-Ohio Express, Inc., a transport company, in March 2006, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  The complaint was brought on behalf of a woman who had applied to work for Pitt-Ohio Express but had allegedly been denied employment as a truck driver or dockworker in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The complaint sought injunctive and monetary relief for the individual complainant and a class of similarly situated women. In August 2006, the court granted the complainant’s request to intervene on behalf of herself and the class of women who had been refused employment due to their sex. \n\nThe parties began settlement discussion on November 20, 2007. Almost a year later, on October 1, 2008, the court approved of the plaintiff-intervenor and Pitt-Ohio’s settlement agreement. The settlement called for the defendant to pay $570,000.00 total to the plaintiff: the plaintiff-intervenor was awarded  $265,000.00 in monetary relief and  $305,000.00 in attorney fees and costs. In addition, the plaintiff-intervenor agreed to dismiss her claims against the defendant. \n\nOn October 21, 2008, the court approved the EEOC and defendant’s consent decree. The court retained jurisdiction for five years to ensure compliance. The terms of this decree were as follows:\n\n1. The defendant was made to pay $2,430,000.00 to be distributed amongst the class of  claimants, women that the EEOC determined to have been denied an opportunity to work as a driver and/or dockworker at Pitt-Ohio establishments. Specifically, the decree aimed at women that were not hired between September 1, 1997 through October 19, 2008.\n2. The defendant was prohibited from discriminating against women applicants based on their sex.\n3. The defendant was prohibited from retaliation.\n4. The defendant was required to implement “priority hiring consideration.” Priority hiring consideration required Pitt-Ohio to make employment offers for driver and dockworker positions to women that EEOC determined were not hired for a position at Pitt-Ohio for which she applied, but who was qualified under Pitt-Ohio’s hiring criteria, and remained interested in employment at Pitt-Ohio as a driver and/or dock worker.\n5. The defendant was obligated to provide EEOC approved anti-employment discrimination training for all employees.\n6. In addition to training, the defendant had to ensure that managers and supervisors enforce anti-employment discrimination through management accountability. This directed managers and supervisors  to take corrective action when necessary to counter individuals engaging in unlawful employment discrimination. Further, managers and supervisors were obligated to report incidents of unlawful discrimination or retaliation to Pitt-Ohio’s human resources group.\n7. Pitt-Ohio Express was obligated to post notices of the outcome of this case to its Ohio terminals and headquarters in areas where bulletins and notices are posted to employees and applicants. These notices were to remain posted for the duration of this consent decree.\n8. Pitt-Ohio Express was obligated to give regular reports to the EEOC in regard to recruitment and hiring of women in the driver and dock worker positions in Ohio. \n9. Both parties bear their own attorney fees and costs.\n\nThis case is currently closed. The consent decree’s duration has lapsed, and the court docket shows no further activity. \n", "summary": "In 2006, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the plaintiff-intervenor, the complainant, filed this class action lawsuit against Pitt-Ohio  Express, Inc., a transport company, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought injunctive relief and damages on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated claiming that Latrobe violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 621. \n \nThe plaintiffs alleged that Latrobe engaged in practices that discriminated against its older work force in conducting terminations and forced retirements over an extended period time. The four plaintiffs named in the complaint are all over the age of fifty and had worked at Latrobe for a number of years. They were all terminated after sending and receiving inappropriate material on their Latrobe email accounts, and were replaced by younger employees. The plaintiffs claimed that they suffered disparate treatment under the ADEA in that Latrobe's stated justifications for terminating the plaintiffs were a pretext for willful age discrimination, as well as disparate impact under the ADEA, because Latrobe favored younger employees and targeted older ones in deciding who would be terminated following the discovery of the emails. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the second claim regarding disparate impact on June 17, 2008. \n\nThe court denied the defendant's motions for summary judgment on March 31, 2009, and April 23, 2009. The court then granted the defendant's motions to exclude any claims under the ADEA that accrued before May 17, 2007. \n\nLatrobe contended that it was entitled to summary judgment because the plaintiffs were unable to show any evidence that age was a determinative factor in its decision to terminate their employment. Latrobe conceded that the plaintiffs established a prima facie case of discrimination, but maintained that their decision to terminate the plaintiffs was based on their violations of Latrobe policy. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that \"but for\" their ages, Latrobe would not have terminated their employment for sending sexually explicit and pornographic emails. Additionally, the plaintiffs admitted that they sent the emails and could not dispute that doing so violated Latrobe's policies. \n\nOn December 29, 2010, the Court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment was granted and dismissed the collective action claims. 761 F.Supp.2d 261 (W.D.

The complaint alleged that Sharp violated the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) by failing to provide the complainant with reasonable accommodation and then discharging her because of her disability.

Judge Daniel Breen was assigned to this case, but the case was later reassigned to Judge Thomas Anderson on May 21, 2008.\n\nOn February 1, 2008, the court granted in part and denied in part Sharp's motion for summary judgment. Sharp contended that first, the EEOC could not produce sufficient evidence that the former employee had a disability. Second, Sharp claimed that the former employee was not a qualified individual with a disability who could be reasonably accommodated. The court considered whether the former employee’s osteoarthritis, which limited her ability to stand for long periods of time, fell under the ADA as a protected disability. The opinion stated that the court found that the case should proceed on the issue of the former employee’s physical limitations to stand. 534 F. Supp. 2d 797\n\nThe defendant went on to argue that the former employee was not a protected individual under the ADA because she would not have been able to work even with reasonable accommodations. In response, the EEOC explained that the former employee’s health condition had deteriorated, but at the time of the discharge, she could have worked with reasonable accommodation. The court found the EEOC’s argument compelling and stated that a jury could reasonably find that the former employee’s condition got worse only after she left the defendant company. In addition, the court found an issue of fact regarding whether or not Sharp could have offered the former employee reasonable accommodations. Id.\n\nThe court granted the defendant’s motion in part in regard to the plaintiff’s ADA claim that the former employee was substantially limited in her ability to walk because the proposed accommodation related only to the inability to stand.

{"document": "On July 15, 2015, five non-profit organizations concerned with environmental justice filed this lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Represented by Earthjustice, the plaintiffs sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs claimed that the EPA violated the APA by failing to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d <i>et seq.</i> (“Title VI”). (The plaintiffs did not bring a Title VI claim.) They sought declaratory and injunctive relief along with attorney’s fees. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs singled out five specific cases in which they said the EPA violated the APA by failing to issue preliminary findings in response to Title VI complaints they had filed between 1994 and 2003 alleging that environmental harm disproportionately affected people of color. The plaintiffs also claimed that the EPA's pattern and practice of failing to issue preliminary findings violated the APA. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the EPA’s failure to meet its mandatory duty and comply with the deadline set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 7.115, which requires the EPA to issue preliminary findings and recommendations for voluntary compliance within 180 days of initiating its investigation into a Title VI complaint, constituted agency action “unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed” under the APA. The plaintiffs also sought an injunction compelling the EPA to issue preliminary findings and recommendations for voluntary compliance for the investigations into each of plaintiffs’ Title VI complaints within ninety days of this Court’s order and complete the complaint investigation procedures in response to each of plaintiffs’ Title VI complaints in compliance with the timelines set forth in the federal regulations.\n \nThe case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Kandis A. Westmore. On September 3, 2015, the case was reassigned to Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong. \n\nOn January 19, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint but did not alter any of their claims or prayer for relief.  The EPA filed a motion to dismiss and, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment on January 26, 2017; the plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment.\n\nOn March 30, 2018, Judge Armstrong ruled on the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and the defendants’ motion to dismiss. The court found that the defendant had a mandatory duty to issue preliminary findings within 180 days after accepting a complaint for investigation, and that the defendant failed to comply with that duty. While declaratory relief was available to the plaintiffs, the court found that there could be no injunctive relief awarded with respect to the underlying Title VI complaints because the EPA had resolved them. However, the court stated that it could issue a prospective injunction requiring the defendant to timely process plaintiffs’ future Title VI complaints that are accepted for investigation by the defendant. Based on these findings, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in part. The court also granted summary judgment for the EPA on the plaintiffs' pattern or practice claim. However, the court did not determine the remedy; it requested that the plaintiffs submit proposed prospective injunctive relief. 2018 WL 1586211.\n\nOn July 11, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to alter the judgment, arguing that Judge Armstrong’s orders regarding prospective injunctive relief were overbroad and unwarranted by the plaintiff’s claims. On the same day, noting that the defendants were “apparently dissatisfied with the Court’s resolution,” Judge Armstrong referred the case to Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler for settlement conferences.  \n\nDue to budget constraints and appropriations withholdings by the federal government, the EPA filed a motion to stay proceedings on December 26, 2018, which Judge Beeler granted.

In order to qualify for this exclusion, the home or rental allowance must be provided as remuneration for services which are \"ordinarily the duties of a minister of the gospel.\"  Section 265(a)(6) allowed a minister of the gospel to claim deductions for residential mortgage interest and property taxes.  Plaintiffs requested that the Court enjoin any allowance or grant of tax benefits for ministers of the gospel under §§107 and 265(a)(6).  Plaintiffs also sought an injunction against the California Franchise Tax Board for sections 17131.6 and 17280(d)(2) of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, which provided similar tax benefits to ministers of the gospel.\n\nOn October 22, 2009, an individual named pastor and 100 unnamed ministers moved to intervene in the action.

The plaintiffs sued the federal government under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb), the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)), and the First Amendment.  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage. The plaintiffs contended that this mandatory contraception coverage violated their sincerely held religious beliefs. \n\nOn January 25, 2013, Judge Amy Berman Jackson granted the government's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for a lack of ripeness, as regulations regarding the contraceptive mandate were under review by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOn March 25, 2013, the plaintiffs appealed the court's dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On October 31, 2013, the Court of Appeals dismissed the plaintiffs' claims as moot due to the newly issued regulations regarding the ACA contraception mandate.  \n\nOn September 20, 2013, the plaintiffs refiled this case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, joined by a number of additional affiliated Catholic nonprofit organizations, objecting to the final regulations updating the contraceptive mandate issued on June 28, 2013. They alleged that under the previous version of the regulations, nonprofit organizations affiliated with a house of worship that benefited from its self-insured plan could also benefit from its exemption to the mandate, and asserted this shelter was no longer available.  \n\nSimilar to the initial complaint, the plaintiffs objected to being required to notify their insurers and or third-party health insurance administrators of their objection to the contraceptive services mandate, and asserted violations of the RFRA, APA, and their rights under the First Amendment. \n\nOn December 21, 2013, the plaintiffs appealed this case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

The Court of Appeals (Judge Cornelia T.L. Pillard) ruled on November 14, 2014, that the accommodation the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has designed for religious nonprofits to comply with the contraceptive coverage mandate does not burden the plaintiffs' religious freedom. 772 F.3d 229 (D.C. Cir. 2014).

Sebelius</a> did not compel them to credit the plaintiffs’ misinterpretation of the regulation the plaintiffs were challenging. 808 F.3d 1.

The Government agreed that the contraceptive mandate could not be legally enforced against the plaintiffs in this matter or their health plans. The Government agreed that plaintiffs would be exempt from the contraceptive mandate and any materially similar regulation or agency policy. The Government also agreed that plaintiffs and their health plans would not suffer any adverse consequences as a result of the settlement agreement and that plaintiffs may reserve their right to challenge any new contraceptive-mandate-like law that the Government may enact.

The judicial court dismissed the charge subsequently, because a conviction under the state wiretap statute required the recording to be secret, and the police officers admitted that the plaintiff's recording was not. \n\nOn February 5, 2010, the plaintiff amended his complaint. On June 8, 2010, the Court (Judge William G. Young) denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case after a hearing. Judge Young denied the defendant police officers' qualified immunity from both the plaintiff's First and Fourth Amendment claims. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the First Circuit. \n\nOn June 29, 2010, Judge Young denied the defendants' motion to stay proceedings in the District Court pending appeal.

Lipez) affirmed the lower court's ruling that denied the defendant police officers' qualified immunity from the plaintiff's constitutional claims. Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011). In the opinion, Judge Lipez found that the First Amendment protected the plaintiff in filming the on-duty police officers in public and that his right to film in this case was clearly established. The defendant police officers lacked probable cause to arrest the plaintiff, thus violating his Fourth Amendment rights, and the lack of probable cause was clearly established, defeating the defendants' asserted qualified immunity from suit. \n\n(On September 27, 2011, the plaintiff in Strahan v. Rowley, Docket No. 1:11-cv-11235, filed a motion to consolidate his case with this case. The Strahan case was then assigned to Magistrate Judge Sorokin as well.

{"document": "On August 29, 2011, a resident of Baltimore County filed this § 1983 claim in Maryland State Circuit Court against the Baltimore City Police Department and three unnamed police officers. The plaintiff alleged that the Police Department had a practice and policy of arresting and destroying the property of persons engaged in recording the public actions of police officers, in violation of Constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments. He also claimed that this practice amounted to a misapplication of the Wiretap Statute. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that he had used his cell phone to videorecord the police arresting his friend in a public place. Three police officers subsequently arrested and detained him for the filming, confiscated his phone, and wiped all video data from the device. This action destroyed not only the video of the arrest, but also images of plaintiff's children and other personal events. The plaintiff sought a permanent injunction that would bar defendants from engaging in arrest and destruction of property for video recording police actions as well as compensatory damages. On October 11, 2011, the case was transferred to the U.S. District Court of Maryland. \n\nOn November 30, 2011, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cognizable cause of action or for partial summary judgment in the alternative. The Police Department argued that the plaintiffs claims were no more than speculation as to a general practice and that the Department's existing training on bystander videotaping rendered any viable claim moot. On January 10, 2012, the United States filed a Statement of Interest, arguing that the District Court should deny the Police Department's summary judgment motion. \n\nOn February 17, 2012, the District Court (Judge Benson Everett Legg) denied the Police Department's motion to dismiss the case or for partial summary judgment. In his opinion, Judge Legg noted that the First Amendment protected the plaintiff's right to photograph on-duty police officers in public, and that the defendants might have violated the plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment rights by deleting videos from the plaintiff's phone if this was done without a legitimate reason. Judge Legg further recognized the factual dispute regarding the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim: whether the plaintiff voluntarily surrendered the phone to the police officers or not. Whether the Police Department promulgated or was deliberately indifferent to an illegal practice was also disputable. The claims proceeded and the parties began discovery. \n\nSettlement talks were unsuccessful and discovery disputes continued over the course of 2013 and early 2014. However, on April 7, 2014, the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal which included a settlement agreement. The settlement included an award for the plaintiff of $25,000 in damages and $225,000 in attorneys fees, but the parties agreed that the payment could not be construed as an expression of liability or concession to the facts alleged. The Police Department also agreed to implement new policies that would properly preserve citizens' rights to record and provide training for officers on the right.\n\nOn April 11, 2014, the stipulation of dismissal was granted by Judge Catherine C. Blake. The case was dismissed with prejudice subject to the Court's continuing jurisdiction to enforce compliance with the settlement agreement.

Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage. Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage conflicted with their sincerely held religious beliefs and violated the First Amendment. \n\nThe parties consented to adjudication by a magistrate judge, and on December 31, 2012, Magistrate Judge David Noce granted a temporary restraining order stopping the federal government from enforcing the contraception mandate. 2012 WL 6738489. This order was renewed on January 14, 2013 until the Court determined the merits of plaintiffs' case and whether further injunctive relief was needed.\n\nOn June 14, 2013, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to add three additional plaintiffs, including non-profit corporation <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13469\"> CNS International Ministries</a> (FA-MO-0011 in this Clearinghouse), and on June 28, 2013, Magistrate Judge David Noce extended preliminary relief to the newly added plaintiffs.\n\nOn September 30, 2013, Judge Noce granted the defendants' motion to stay the case proceedings pending Eight Circuit rulings on two similar cases, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12665\">Annex Medical, Inc v.

Judge Noce also extended the earlier preliminary injunction for all parties.\n\nOn December 4, 2013, the plaintiffs amended their complaint again in response to updates to the contraceptive mandate implementing regulation which were finalized on July 2, 2013. Plaintiffs argued that by making \"an accommodation\" for religious non-profits wherein third party insurance administrators instead provide contraceptive materials, the new regulation was more like a \"shell game\" because the non-profit employees would still receive coverage through their employment at these non-profits.\n\nOn December 30, 2013, Judge Noce ordered the earlier preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order be sustained as to non-profit and for-profit plaintiffs alike. 2013 WL 6858588. On February 28, 2014, the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal with the Eighth Circuit, against the district court's preliminary injunction, arguing that the third party insurance providers had an independent obligation under the ACA to provide contraceptive coverage to religious non-profit employees. The defendants further argued that, even if there were a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, the accommodation was the least restrictive means possible to accomplish its compelling interest in ensuring access to no-cost contraceptive coverage. \n\nIn district court, Judge Noce entered a permanent injunction on February 13, 2015 against the defendants, prohibiting them from enforcing the July 2013 version of the contraception mandate against all plaintiffs. The district court stated that following the Supreme Court's June 2014 holding in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12661\">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a> that the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violated RFRA when applied to closely-held for-profit corporations.

The Eighth Circuit rejected the defendants' arguments, but it did not address the First Amendment claims because it concluded that religious non-profits were entitled to relief based on the RFRA claims. The court accepted the the plaintiff's argument that they would be forced to violate their religious beliefs by complying with either the contraceptive mandate or the accommodation process or to incur severe monetary penalties for refusing to comply. The Eighth Circuit cited a Supreme Court injunction issued in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13893\">Wheaton College v. Sebelius</a> on July 3, 2014, which held that the nonprofit accommodation process, requiring the objecting organization to notify their insurer, or provide specifications about their employee insurance to HHS, could be satisfied by a general notification to HHS of their religious views. 134 S.Ct. 2806.\n\nOn October 9, 2015, the district court entered a final judgment against the government and in favor of the for-profit plaintiffs. 2015 WL 13664031. Judge Noce wrote that the non-profit portion of this case would likely continue through to an appeal given the Circuit split on the application of the ACA's birth control mandate to non-profits, but that the decision would not likely affect the resolution for the for-profit plaintiffs.\n\nThe defendants petitioned for certiorari, and on May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court granted cert and vacated the Eighth Circuit's ruling, remanding the case. 2016 WL 2842448.

On December 7, 2017, the court ordered the defendants to file a response to the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees by December 29, 2017. \n\nOn December 12, 2017, the court ordered a hearing to be held on January 26, 2018 on the issue of the plaintiffs' motion for permanent injunction. On January 22, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to have the court rule on the issue of the permanent injunction without a hearing. This motion was granted on January 26, 2018. \n\nOn March 28, 2018, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for permanent injunctive and declaratory relief. 2018 WL 1520031. The court declared the contraceptive mandate in the ACA to be a violation of RFRA and enjoined the government from enforcing the mandate.

Docket No. 1:14-cv-00146-LG-JCG. The complaint challenged the ACA as finalized. Plaintiffs alleged that, although under the amended ACA the Diocese itself likely fell within the \"religious employer\" exception, affiliated Catholic entities were only considered \"eligible organizations\" qualifying for an accommodation. This accommodation would require plaintiffs to provide self-certification to their insurance provider setting forth their religious objections to the ACA, in turn triggering an obligation on the part of the insurance provider to procure the services plaintiffs find objectionable. According to the plaintiffs, this series of events made them the but-for cause of providing contraception coverage in violation of their sincerely held beliefs. Plaintiffs continued to ask the court to grant a permanent injunction against enforcement of the relevant provisions of the ACA.\n\nOn November 7, 2014, the parties moved to stay proceedings in this case pending the  Fifth Circuit's decision in consolidated appeals--<i>East Texas Baptist University v.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, asked the court for both declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that federal rules adopted pursuant to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") violated their sincerely held religious beliefs by requiring them to provide coverage for contraception through their companies' group health insurance plans.  Specifically, the plaintiffs objected to the ACA rules requiring them to provide coverage for emergency contraception, which the plaintiffs considered an abortifacient.  The plaintiffs did not object to other forms of contraception.  Claiming that providing coverage for emergency contraception would both contravene their Christian faith and compel speech contrary to their beliefs, the plaintiffs sought an exemption from the ACA's contraception mandate for themselves and other business owners with similar religious objections.\n\nOn October 15, 2012, the District Court (Judge Joe Heaton) denied a group of current members of Congress leave to file an amicus curiae brief arguing for a broad application of RFRA.  Judge Heaton found that the interests of the Congressmen coincided wholly with the interests of the plaintiffs, and that additional submissions addressing the application of RFRA were unnecessary.\n\nIn their brief opposing the injunction motion, filed October 22, 2012, the defendant Departments argued that the contraception mandate did not substantially burden the plaintiffs' religious liberty rights under RFRA, and that, regardless of the burden's magnitude, the regulations were the least restrictive means of advancing the government's compelling interests in public health and gender equality.  The brief further argued that the mandate did not violate the plaintiff's religious freedom because it was a neutral law of general applicability.\n\nOn November 19, 2012, the District Court (Judge Heaton) denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that secular, for-profit corporations such as Hobby Lobby did not have a constitutional right to religious freedom, and that the individual plaintiffs were not likely to prevail because the mandate was a neutral law of general applicability that was reasonably related to a legitimate government purpose.  The Court further found that indirect financial support of subjectively objectionable conduct was not a substantial burden on the plaintiffs' religious freedom.  Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, 870 F. Supp. 2d 1278 (W.D. Okla. 2012).  \n\nThe plaintiffs appealed the injunction denial to the 10th Circuit.  On December 12, 2012, District Court Judge Heaton granted the defendants' joint motion to stay the district court proceedings pending the 10th Circuit appeal.  On December 20, 2012, the Court of Appeals (Judge Carlos F. Lucero and Judge David M. Ebel) denied the plaintiffs' motion for an injunction pending appeal on the same grounds as the District Court's injunction denial.  Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 6930302 (10th Cir.).  \n\nFollowing this denial, the plaintiffs applied to the Circuit Justice for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, for an injunction pending appellate review.  On December 26, 2012, Justice Sotomayor denied this application, finding that the plaintiffs' entitlement to injunctive relief was not indisputably clear.  Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, 133 S.Ct. 641 (2012).  \n\nOn March 29, 2013, the 10th Circuit granted initial and expedited en banc review.  That is, the Court decided to hear the case not via ordinary panel process, with rehearing en banc as a subsequent possibility, but rather initially in front of all the circuit's judges.  Oral arguments occurred May 23, 2013.\n\nOn June 27, 2013, the 10th Circuit, en banc, reversed the District Court's injunction denial, finding that the plaintiffs were entitled to bring RFRA claims; that they had established a likelihood of successfully proving that the contraception mandate substantially burdened their RFRA rights; and that they had demonstrated irreparable harm.  The 10th Circuit sent the case back to the District Court, asking the lower court to address two remaining prongs of the injunction inquiry (balance of equities and the effect on the public interest) and to decide whether to grant or deny the plaintiffs' motion for an injunction.  Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, 2013 WL 3216103 (10th Cir. en banc).\n\nThe plaintiffs immediately filed an emergency motion asking the District Court to grant a temporary injunction pending the full injunction hearing.  The District Court (Judge Heaton) granted this motion on June 28, 2013, followed up by a longer-lasting order on July 19, 2013 WL 3869832.  The government sought certiorari review of the 10th Circuit decision in the Supreme Court; cert was granted on November 26, 2013.

Sebelius</a>, a similar case from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\nOn June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court affirmed.  In 5-4 opinion by Justice Alito, the Court held that the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violate RFRA, when applied to closely-held for-profit corporations.  The Court emphasized, however, that alternative methods for meeting the government's asserted interest were available.  To quote the syllabus (which summarizes the opinion), \"the Government could, e.g., assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives to women unable to obtain coverage due to their employers' religious objections. Or it could extend the accommodation that HHS has already established for religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate. That accommodation does not impinge on the plaintiffs' religious beliefs that providing insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion and it still serves HHS's stated interests.\"  In addition, the Court insisted that its opinion was narrow:  \"This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, e.g., for vaccinations or blood transfusions, must necessarily fall if they conflict with an employer's religious beliefs. Nor does it provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice.\"  Justice Ginsburg wrote the dissent, joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan (although Breyer and Kagan did not sign on to a few pages of the dissent that argued that for-profit corporations lacked rights under RFRA; they said this issue need not yet be decided).  \n\nPlease note that this case was previously titled <i>Sebelius v.

{"document": "On September 20, 2013, a group of religious-based universities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Oklahoma. The plaintiffs sued the federal government under the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs, Southern Nazarene University, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Baptist University, and Mid-America Christian University, alleged that the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employee and student health plans provide coverage of contraception violated their religious foundings. The plaintiffs, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, asked the court to rule that the ACA's contraception insurance mandate, even with the accommodation for non-profit religious organizations, was unconstitutional. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked for both a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent the government from enforcing the contraception insurance mandate against them.\n\nOn November 27, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. On December 23, 2013, the district court (Judge Stephen P. Friot) granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court concluded that the government had not shown that the plaintiffs' objection to certain methods of contraception, including Plan B, frustrated the overall goal of ACA contraception coverage. \n\nThe government appealed this case to the Tenth Circuit on February 11, 2014. On July 14, 2015, the Tenth Circuit (Judge Scott Matheson, Jr.) denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, (794 F.3d 1151) in an opinion that joined this case with <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13143\">Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Sebelius</a>. The same day, the plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. The plaintiffs objected to using the expanded accommodation designed by the court, in which they would not have to notify their insurers directly about their religious opposition to contraception, but would have to communicate that opposition and the name of their insurer to the Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs requested a rehearing en banc, but the Tenth Circuit denied the request in an order on September 3, 2015. (799 F.3d 1315).\n\nOn November 6, 2015, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in this case. The Court considered whether notifying the federal government by signing a form identifying the employer as a religious nonprofit that objects to the contraceptive services mandate (so that the government can work with the insurer or benefits provider to ensure employees have contraceptive coverage) violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or constitutes the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest.

In the District Court, the case proceeded with the parties filing joint status reports as they tried to negotiate a settlement amidst changing regulations. President Trump issued an Executive Order in May 2017 directing the Department of Health and Human Services to address conscience-based objections to the preventive care mandate. The Department of Health and Human Services followed the Executive Order, issuing an exemption to religious organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor. \n\nOn April 16, 2018, the plaintiffs moved for permanent injunction and declaratory relief, arguing that the new regulations proved that forcing religious organizations to provide contraceptive care violates the RFRA.

{"document": "This case is one of the many filed in federal district courts across the country by non-profit Catholic organizations challenging the ACA's system for ensuring that employee health insurance covers birth control. Specifically, the plaintiffs objected to notifying the government or their health insurer that they were claiming a religious exemption from the ACA regulation's mandatory insurance coverage for contraception. The current regulatory accommodation allows religious organizations who object for religious reasons to providing contraceptive coverage for their employees to notify their insurer, or notify the government directly, of that objection. Then, the government will work with the insurer or health benefits provider to ensure the employees have access to contraception. The religious employers claim that this approach violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, because they see their action of notifying the government as starting a chain of events that results in their employees receiving contraception. \n\nThis particular lawsuit was filed by Bishop Zubik of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, and the Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.  (Their first litigation effort, filed in 2012, was dismissed as unripe. See <a href=http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12038>Zubik v.

On November 21, 2013, the court (Judge Arthur J. Schwab) granted the plaintiffs' motion for expedited preliminary injunction. 983 F.Supp.2d 576. The court held that complying with the certification requirement contraception mandate would cause injury to the plaintiffs' religious liberties and that there was a high likelihood of success on the merits of the RFRA and First Amendment claims.  On December 20, 2013, Judge Schwab granted the plaintiffs' unopposed motion to convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction.  2013 WL 6922024. The court recognized that the while the Diocese itself was exempt from the contraception mandate as a religious employer, the new regulation required the remaining affiliated organizations to tell the government about their religious objection to contraception. The Court held that the remaining plaintiffs demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their RFRA challenge, noting that requiring self-certification represented a substantial burden on their religious exercise by compelling them to start the chain of events that ends with contraceptive products and services being provided to their employees. The Court was concerned that the Church and its affiliated nonprofits had different responsibilities under the mandate. \n\nOn February 11, 2014, the government appealed the permanent injunction.

Organizations exempt from the contraception mandate faced no burden on exercise of their religion, and they were therefore unlikely to succeed in proving a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. And organizations eligible to receive an \"accommodation\" under the law needed only to provide a \"self-certification\" that documented that they had a religious objection.

Specifically, Alabama HB 56 prohibited any individual from entering into a business transaction with the State without proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful immigration status.  A separate Alabama law required that owners of mobile homes obtain annual registration tags from the State.  Together, these two laws put undocumented immigrant mobile home owners in a difficult position:  renew the tags and be subject to a felony prosecution under HB 56, or refrain from renewing the tags and risk other civil and criminal penalties.  \n\nOn November 23, 2011, the District Court (Judge Myron H.

In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") determined that the defendant had substantial disparities in the rates given to minority versus non-Hispanic white borrowers. The FTC requested more information from the defendant, including loan data and the company's policies, and in 2011 the Department of Justice took over the investigation. The data obtained from the investigation showed that from 2006 through at least 2010, the defendant permitted its mortgage brokers to charge excessive fees beyond the fee caps to African American and Hispanic borrowers more frequently than white borrowers based solely on race and national origin.  The defendant had a two-step process set in place where the first step determined whether the applicant satisfied objective criteria.  The second step was more subjective and allowed mortgage brokers to charge fees with little checks on their discretion.  The defendant did not set up objective criteria to guide the mortgage brokers in setting fees or interest rates.  The disparities between the rates given to whites and minorities were prevalent in thousands of loans made in numerous states.  \n\nOn October 1, 2013, the District Court (Judge Marilyn L. Huff) entered a consent order between the parties.  Although the defendant did not admit to any pattern or practice of discrimination, the order enjoined the defendant from engaging in any discriminatory act or practice and subjected the defendant to monitoring. The defendant was also required to pay $3 million into a settlement fund to compensate those affected by its discrimination. The order was set to terminate after three years if the defendant had complied during that time period.\n\nOn September 28, 2016, the parties jointly moved to extend the consent decree by one month, which was the time that Plaza needed to achieve substantial compliance.

The City sued JP Morgan Chase Bank under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Fair Housing Act/Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA). The City sought damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the bank's lending practices were predatory, intentionally discriminated against minority borrowers, and had a disparate impact on minorities. \n\nSpecifically, the complaint alleged disparate impact claims, based on statistical data, that: 1) lending practices resulted in disproportionate number of foreclosures in minority neighborhoods; 2) minority homeowners received disproportionate number of predatory loans. It also alleged the bank intentionally discriminated against minorities by: 1) targeting minorities for predatory loans; 2) underwriting adjustable loan rates that borrowers could not afford; and 3) inducing foreclosures by refusing to offer refinancing or loan restructuring on fair terms. The City claimed it was injured as a result of the bank's practices through loss of property tax and decrease in property value.\n\nThe City also brought two other actions regarding discriminatory and predatory lending against Wells Fargo (City of Los Angeles v. Wells Fargo & Company, No. 2:13-cv-09007-ODW) and Citigroup (City of Los Angeles v.

The complaint further alleged that the City had been injured by the bank's practices because it still had to provide costly municipal services for properties in minority neighborhoods that had became vacant as a direct result of discriminatory loans originated or purchased by the bank.\n\nOn November 14, 2014, Judge Wright denied JP Morgan's motion to dismiss, stating that the City's allegations were sufficient to withstand the pleading stage.

{"document": "On May 5, 2008, an association of residents of a New Jersey neighborhood filled a lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.  The residents, represented by lawyers from South Jersey Legal Services, asked the court for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, claiming that the defendants' redevelopment plan for the Gardens neighborhood represented a violation of the Fair Housing Act, and of the Equal Protection clauses of the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants' redevelopment plan, which called for the razing of the existing homes located in the Gardens neighborhood, the only one with predominantly African American and Hispanic residents, made housing unavailable because of race. Moreover, the plaintiffs claimed that the redevelopment plan had a disparate impact on African-American and Hispanic households in violation of the Fair Housing Act because it destroyed their homes without providing adequate relocation assistance.   The township had displaced hundreds of predominantly African American and Hispanic residents and, the plaintiffs claimed, \"devastated a once stable minority community in need of only modest improvement.\" Only about 70 homes out of 300 remain scattered throughout the neighborhood and no new homes were constructed in 10 years. On July 18, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn October 28, 2008, the Court (Judge Noel Hillman) issued an order with respect to the defendants' motion to dismiss. Three of the allegations under state law related to local redevelopment and housing laws and open meetings laws were dismissed as moot. Two counts related to denial of just compensation under state law were dismissed as moot. In other respects, the motion was denied. \n\nOn November 25, 2008, the Court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff's motion to file an amended complaint. The plaintiffs could not file allegations pertaining to denial of just compensation in light of the Court's opinion of October 28, 2008. On December 3, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which added more facts and allegations of violation of the Due Process clauses under the U.S. and New Jersey constitutions.\n\nOn February 13, 2009, the Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. The injunction was sought with respect to disparate impact claim under the FHA, and the Court stated the plaintiffs did not show they were likely to succeed on the merits, and suffer and irreparable injury. Even if they lost housing, there was insufficient showing that monetary compensation would not be enough.\n\nOn October 23, 2009, the Court granted in part, denied in part, and continue in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. The motions with respect to claims under the FHA, EEOC, Equal Protection claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, were treated as motions for summary judgment, and continued until later. The Court dismissed claims of Due Process violations under the U.S. and New Jersey constitutions, claims of discrimination under state laws, and claims of violations of local redevelopment and housing laws. \n\nOn January 19, 2010, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On January 3, 2011, the district court (Judge Noel Hillman) granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Specifically, the district court found that the redevelopment plan of the Gardens neighborhood did not have a disparate impact on African Americans and Hispanics. The court found that the residents were unable to make a prima facie showing that the plan had a disparate impact on protected groups because they were unable to show that the plan had a greater adverse impact on protected groups than on others, and were unable to show that the township's legitimate interest in redevelopment could be accomplished with less discriminatory impact.  Finally, the court held that the defendants had not acted with the discriminatory intent necessary to violate the United States Constitution. \n\nThe plaintiffs appealed the district court's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In an opinion filed September 13, 2011 the court (Judges Sloviter, Fuentes, and Fisher) vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court made clear that at the summary judgment stage, the district court is to take the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Under that standard, the evidence submitted was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact under the Fair Housing Act. Specifically, the court held that the evidence presented by the residents that African American and Hispanic citizens were 8 times more likely to be affected by the redevelopment plan was sufficient to show a disparate impact. Furthermore, the appellate court made it clear that the district court had erred by asking whether the defendants had treated minorities the same as other residents, rather than asking whether minority residents were affected differently than the other residents.  On May 22, 2012, the Third Circuit's mandate was entered.\n\nOn June 11, 2012, the defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United State Supreme Court, asking for review of the legal question whether disparate impact claims exist under the Fair Housing Act.  This was an issue on which the Court had granted review in Magner v. Gallagher (Sup. Ct. Docket 10-1032), but then that case was withdrawn by its defendant, the City of St. Paul, after full briefing but before argument.  The Court granted cert., and argument was scheduled for December 4, 2013.  Observers expected the Court to strike down the disparate impact theory.  Instead, on November 13, 2013, the case settled.  \n\nThe settlement--which news reports state was funded, in part, by an organization called The Reinvestment Fund--includes provision for construction of 44 new homes, with the first to be ready for occupancy before the end of 2014.

{"document": "The Fortune Society, a non-profit organization that provides temporary and permanent housing to hundreds of formerly incarcerated individuals each year, tried to rent apartments at The Sand Castle, an apartment complex managed and owned by the Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corp. (the “Fund”). When the Fund learned that the Fortune Society served formerly imprisoned individuals, they refused to rent apartments. \n\nOn October 30, 2014, the Fortune Society filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiff sued the Fund (and related entities) under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and New York State and City law. Represented by Relman, Dane & Colfax, the plaintiff sought injunctive, monetary and declarative relief. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant maintained a discriminatory policy that prohibited anyone with a criminal record from renting an apartment or living at The Sand Castle. Specifically, they claimed that the policy had the purpose and effect of discriminating against African Americans and Latinos.\n\nThe court set up a discovery schedule, which proceeded for about a year. On May 1, 2015, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. \n\nOn June 25, 2015, the court ordered the parties to meet and discuss settlement in light of the recent Supreme Court decision <i>Inclusive Communities Project v. Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs</i>. (See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13857\">here</a> in the Clearinghouse). That opinion held that the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate impact liability, but emphasized that liability followed only if the challenged policy or practice actually caused, rather than merely accompanied, a racial disparity.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment on its race discrimination claims based on disparate impact on September 30, 2016. On the same day, the defendant moved for summary judgment. The defendant claimed that summary judgment was appropriate because discovery confirmed that it did not maintain a blanket ban on residents with criminal records. \n\nOn November 16, 2015, the parties met at a status conference to discuss settlement, as recommended by the court. But they failed to agree. \n\nOn October 18, 2016, the United States entered a Statement of Interest.

Scanlon) issued an order denying the plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment and grating in part and denying in part the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on July 3, 2019. The court denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff’s disparate impact claim but granted it with respect to the plaintiff’s disparate treatment claim. In addition, the court scheduled a status conference on August 20, 2019, to discuss settlement possibilities. \n\nThe parties jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice on October 11, 2019. On October 16, 2019, the defendant and the plaintiff filed a status report, stating that the matter has been resolved.

The data obtained from the investigation showed that in 2007 and 2008, when all other factors were accounted for, the defendant permitted its mortgage brokers to charge excessive broker fees to African American and Hispanic borrowers more frequently than white borrowers based solely on race and national origin.  The defendant had a two-step process set in place where the first step determined whether the applicant satisfied objective criteria.

{"document": "On May 1, 1984, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division informed the Governor of Connecticut that it would investigate the living conditions at Southbury Training School, an institutional care facility for people with intellectual disabilities (ICF/MR) in Southbury, Connecticut, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq.  On September 11, 1985, the Department of Justice announced its findings.  Three lawsuits, including this CRIPA lawsuit, followed.  A class action, Messier v. Southbury Training School, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=440\">ID-CT-0003</a> in this Clearinghouse, appears to have been treated as a companion case at some points during litigation.  Another private action, McCoy v. Belmont, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=5464\">ID-CT-0006</a>, appears to have been separately litigated.  Judge Ellen B. Burns of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut adjudicated all or part of these three lawsuits.\n\nThe United States filed this lawsuit against the State of Connecticut, its Department of Mental Retardation, and the Director of Southbury on July 25, 1986.  The United States alleged that living conditions at Southbury placed residents in grave danger of bodily harm and death.  According to the Complaint, the individuals with developmental disabilities placed at Southbury were subject to systematic abuse and neglect.  Southbury did not provide adequate medical and psychological care and employed too few medical and direct care staff.  In addition, Southbury's facilities were unsafe and unsanitary.  Instead of offering residents individualized habilitative programming, Southbury used physical and chemical restraints to control most residents' behavior.    \n\nOn July 25, 1986, the parties also entered a consent decree, under which the State admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to dramatically change Southbury's operations.  For instance, the State agreed to institute individualized habilitation programming for all residents and to only use chemical and physical restraints in emergencies or when medically or therapeutically indicated.  In addition, the State agreed to improve medical care by hiring more medical staff, developing a medical recordkeeping system, and improving the availability and overall quality of medical care and physical therapy.  In addition, the state agreed to improve staff-to-resident ratios by either hiring and training more direct care staff or reducing the number of Southbury's residents (in 1986, Southbury had over one thousand residents).  In addition, Southbury agreed to strategically address any new deficiencies or risks to residents' health or lives.  Although the consent decree could only be enforced by those party to it, the defendants agreed to submit quarterly progress reports to the court.  The court approved the consent decree on December 26, 1986, just four days after denying the Messier plaintiffs' petition for intervener status.  \n\nConnecticut's compliance with the consent decree was rocky from the start.  On July 28, 1987, the State petitioned the court to extend some of the consent decree's original deadlines because approval of the remedial plan was taking longer than expected.  The court did not approve the remedial plan until July 22, 1988.  On April 24, 1990, the court issued a remedial order directed to deficiencies in individualized planning, program staffing, medical treatment, and mental health care.  Under the 1990 remedial order, Southbury's staff was required to monitor medicated residents for side effects, especially tardive dyskinesia.  In addition, the court mandated monthly human rights reviews for residents with aggressive or self-injurious behaviors and for residents on psychotropic medications.  Finally, the State was instructed to hire more physicians (general practitioners and specialists) and nurses to serve residents at Southbury.  On December 1, 1991, the court modified the 1990 remedial order.\n\nDissatisfied with the effects of the consent decree, Southbury's residents filed Messier v. Southbury Training School in 1994.  On March 5, 1996, the court denied the Messier plaintiffs' motion to consolidate their lawsuit with United States v. Connecticut.  The court, however, agreed that Southbury was still not providing adequate services to persons with developmental disabilities.  On June 19, 1996, the court held the State in contempt of the consent decree, remedial plan, and remedial orders and appointed a Special Master (David Ferleger) to oversee compliance.  United States v. Connecticut, 931 F. Supp. 974 (D. Conn. 1996), appeal dismissed, No. 96-6218, 1997 WL 321594 (2d Cir. June 13, 1997).  The court was especially concerned by the rates and causes of mortality at Southbury.  For instance, one resident died from severe burns after he lit his clothes on fire while smoking.  The court noted that Southbury knew that the resident smoked unsafely, but neither taught him how to smoke safely nor observed him when he smoked.   \n\nBetween July 30, 1997, and February 22, 2006, the Special Master submitted twenty-six status reports, sixty-three topic-specific reports, and numerous other reports, recommendations, and analyses.  Based on the docket, it appears that the Special Master addressed (1) individualized planning, (2) community placement policies, (3) abuse and neglect, (4) the rights of persons with disabilities, (5) human rights and behavioral programming reviews, (6) occupational and physical therapy, (7) medical and dental care, (8) dosage benchmarks, (9) physical restraint techniques and standards, (10) mortality investigations, (11) case management and advocacy, (12) quality assurance plans, (13) facility upkeep, safety, and sanitation, (14) transportation, (15) employment of direct care staff, medical professionals, and specialized therapists, and (16) staff development.  The defendants contested most of the Special Master's reports, but the court ultimately accepted all of them.  For instance, on February 22, 2004, the court accepted and adopted the Special Master's report on Southbury's development of mortality review procedures.  \n\nIt appears that the court began removing components of the consent decree from active judicial oversight in August 2000.  On November 22, 2002, the Messier plaintiffs again requested intervener status, but the court denied their request on January 7, 2003.  On June 24, 2004, the court similarly denied a motion by the Messier plaintiffs to file an amicus curiae brief about compliance with the consent decree.  \n\nOn June 20, 2005, the parties filed a revised joint settlement agreement, which would have released all outstanding elements of the consent decree from active judicial oversight.  The court, however, refused to endorse the agreement on July 21, 2005.  The court was apparently concerned about continued deficiencies in habilitation programming and medical care.  On September 16, 2005, the State filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but did not request that the district court proceedings be stayed.  On January 17, 2006, the Special Master reported that the State had successfully implemented comprehensive habilitation programming for all persons served at Southbury.  On February 26, 2006, the Special Master's medical consultant issued a similar report regarding the adequacy of medical care.  \n\nOn March 25, 2006, the court issued an order purging the defendants of contempt and concluding judicial oversight of the consent decree and remedial plan.  The court, however, retained jurisdiction over the consent decree and remedial order for enforcement purposes.  Between March 24 and June 25, 2006, the court declared all outstanding motions moot, finalized payment to the Special Master, and ordered the return of unused Special Master funds to the State.  On June 25, 2006, Connecticut withdrew its joint settlement agreement appeal.  Today, Southbury's website embraces the philosophy of community placement and acknowledges that future challenges will require Southbury to continue to grow and develop. On November 2, 2009, the Court granted a joint motion to dismiss the case because the parties agreed that the consent decree and remedial plan were fully implemented.", "summary": "Following an investigation by the United States Department of Justice, the U.S. filed this lawsuit against the State of Connecticut, its Department of Mental Retardation, and the Director of Southbury Training School (Southbury) on July 25, 1986, alleging that living conditions at Southbury placed residents in grave danger of bodily harm and death. On the same day, the parties also entered into a consent decree that required Southbury to provide better programming, disciplinary procedures, medical care, recordkeeping, and increase staffing. After some problems with compliance and placing the state in contempt, the Court assigned a special master to monitor Southbury.

{"document": "After budget cuts, an intermediate care facility serving individuals with intellectual disabilities operated by Washington State was ordered to cut costs by up to $1.8 million. To comply with the October 2010 order, management moved 27 residents from the intermediate care facility to its nursing facility and simultaneously reduced programs and staffing at both sites. After bringing problems to the attention of state agencies, investigations by Disability Rights Washington (DRW)—the state National Disability Rights Network organization—found materially significant loss of services, findings which were confirmed by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS). In fact, CMS found over 40,000 violations of the NHRA pertaining to these 27 individuals alone. \n\nCMS found that Washington State failed to comply with Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA), that residents were housed in inappropriate settings, the transfer violated federal law, and as a result the state had received federal funds in error. CMS then announced an expansion of the investigation to other state-operated, Medicaid-certified nursing facilities. Pertinent state departments issued a corrective action plan in response to CMS’s findings.  \n\nDRW claimed the correction plan was inadequate in a complaint it filed on April 16, 2014 on behalf of a class of plaintiffs of people with intellectual disabilities. Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, the plaintiffs sued the Secretary of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services and the Director of the Washington State Health Care Authority in their official capacities under the Medicaid Act and the Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA). The plaintiffs, represented by both DRW and a private firm, sought injunctive and declaratory relief to require defendants to establish an adequate system to provide Pre-admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) screenings, assessments, specialized services, and, when appropriate, community-based integrated placement for class members who reside in privately-operated Medicaid-certified Nursing Facilities.  \n\nDefendants filed an answer on May 8, 2014. The plaintiff moved for class certification on October 17, 2014 and filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of the proper standard for PASRR screenings and evaluations. On November 10, 2014 defendants responded to plaintiffs’ motions and moved to dismiss plaintiff’s claims and for partial summary judgment.  The motions were resolved by the court on April 10, 2015 with Judge James L. Robart ruling mostly in favor of the plaintiffs. 99 F.Supp.3d 1297. The Judge granted part of defendant’s motion to dismiss, but gave plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint and file a valid claim.  \n\nThe Court certified a class (April 10, 2015) comprised of all individuals who: (A) are or will be residents of Medicaid-certified, privately-operated nursing facilities in the State of Washington; and (B) who are Medicaid recipients with an intellectual disability or related condition(s) such that they are eligible to be screened and assessed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7) and 42 C.F.R. § 483.122 et seq. \n\nThe defendants appealed the class certification on April 24, 2015 to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Docket #:15-80076. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff’s only allegation was that he should have been a part of this class, so therefore was not qualified to represent it.  On August 10, 2015, Judges Michael Daly Hawkins and Andrew D. Hurwitz of the Ninth Circuit denied permission to appeal.\n\nAfter negotiations, in August of 2016, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for approval of a settlement agreement, class certification, and a settlement approval hearing and process.  The settlement agreement required copies to be sent to every member of the class. Class members would also be notified of the date and time of the final settlement hearing.  Any objecting class member had an opportunity to speak at the final hearing. \n\nAfter giving time for notice to be provided to all class members, the final settlement hearing took place on January 9, 2017.  The court approved the final settlement agreement on January 10, 2017. 2017 WL 123011. The settlement provided for a comprehensive reform of defendant’s PASRR screenings required under the NHRA, establishing procedures for timeliness of evaluations, Post-PASRR meetings, provision of specialized services to increase class members’ independence and/or discharge planning for class members who are medically able and willing to live in an alternative placement in the community. It also established metrics for monitoring implementation of new PASRR system, with reporting to class counsel on a quarterly basis.

{"document": "In 1990, prior to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a group of residents of the Wyoming State Training School, an institution that housed individuals with intellectual disabilities, brought this lawsuit. Represented by the Wyoming Protection and Advocacy System, the plaintiffs sought to remedy unconstitutional conditions and statutory violations at the institution and aimed to force Wyoming to create community living options for many of its residents.\n\nThough it predated the ADA (and the ADA interpretation endorsed by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C.), the lawsuit alleged numerous legal violations. The plaintiffs alleged violations of state and federal disability-focused statutes, most prominently Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Medicaid. The plaintiffs also alleged violations of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (now the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act) based on the institutions' failures to assess the individual needs of and provide educational services to school-age children in the institution. Finally, via 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiffs alleged that the institution and its officials violated the U.S. Constitution (including a number of Due Process-based liberty interests and Equal Protection).\n\nThe Complaint detailed an extensive set of inhumane and neglectful circumstances that led to these violations. Individuals in the Wyoming State Training School were not individually assessed or provided with sufficient habilitation, training, and treatment for their needs. Staff routinely failed to protect residents from abuse and physical injuries (including self-inflicted injuries). There was insufficient space and lack of privacy for the residents.  Residents were not provided socialization, stimulation, education, therapy, or training in self-care. Staff were overwhelmed, unsupported and not provided with adequate training.  \n\nThe Complaint further alleged that the plaintiffs had a right to live in the community where possible, and that the state was responsible for providing the services that would allow Training School residents to live in integrated settings.\n\nThe litigation process moved toward settlement. On April 27, 1990, the parties stipulated to the certification of the class and entered a Stipulation to Establish the Framework for Settlement.  In this Stipulation, the parties laid out areas to resolve, appointed an expert committee to carry out the negotiation, made plans to provide for the immediate needs of the plaintiffs, and set ground rules for future negotiation.  In July 1990, the parties entered a stipulation on the immediate needs of the plaintiffs, which included the creation of an Immediate Needs Assessment Team to engage in the necessary individualized planning for each plaintiff.  \n\nAfter several more months of discovery and negotiations, the parties entered a complete Settlement Agreement on March 31, 1991 to address the needs of both those residing at the institution and individuals with disabilities who would be at risk of placement in the institution without additional support services.  The Agreement sought to substantially improve conditions at the Wyoming State Training School.  It covered the nature of the institution, its staffing, educational opportunities, and individualized planning, with substantial monitoring and reporting requirements.  The agreement also sought to increase the availability of community placement options. The parties selected a Compliance Advisory Board (CAB) composed of two experts who would both assist in carrying out the agreement and report to the court on its implementation.  \n\nThe CAB continued to report to the court until the fall of 1994.  During this period, a bout of litigation emerged in the case over the placement of class member Sara Kawulok. With the Kawulok issue resolved and substantial progress documented, the parties agreed to relieve the CAB of its reporting requirements in late 1994. The parties entered a permanent settlement in October 1994 and in December 1994, the court dismissed its jurisdiction over the case.

The parties agreed in 1991 to a settlement that was designed not only to improve conditions in the institution, but also to prevent unnecessary institutionalization and create options for community living for individuals with intellectual disabilities in Wyoming.  The court's jurisdiction was ended in 1994."}
{"document": "This case is the reincarnation of a previously filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the Legal Arizona Workers Act (the \"Act\"). The District Court (Judge Wake) dismissed that suit,  Arizona Contractors Assoc., Inc. v. Napolitano, on December 7, 2007 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The court found that there was no justiciable case or controversy against the Governor or Attorney General, as they did not have the power to enforce the challenged Act.  The court noted that only county attorneys had that power.\n\nImmediately after the dismissal of Arizona Contractors, on December 9, 2007, a coalition of trade organizations and Arizona employers filed a lawsuit under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2201 in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Phoenix division [Arizona Contractors Ass'n v. Candelaria, 07-2496].  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel at this stage, asked the court for injunctive and declaratory relief and attorney's fees, challenging the constitutionality of the Act.  The Act required Arizona employers to verify the employment eligibility of each employee through a federal verification program and established sanctions against Arizona employers that employed aliens who were not authorized to work.  The Act provides the Superior Court of the State of Arizona with the power to suspend or revoke the business licenses of employers who intentionally or knowingly employ illegal aliens.  Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the Act was pre-empted by federal immigration law. \n\nA companion case was also re-filed on December 12, 2007 by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Immigration Law Center, the ACLU Foundation Immigrants Rights Project and the Arizona ACLU.  [Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc. v. Goddard, 2:07-cv-02518-SMM].  The District Court (Judge Neil V. Wake) consolidated these two remaining cases on December 14, 2007. \n\nPlaintiffs in the consolidated action alleged, as they had in the previously filed case, that the Act violated the Supremacy Clause of the U. S. Constitution as it was preempted by federal immigration law and the federal government's exclusive authority to regulate immigration. Plaintiffs also asserted that the Act violated the due process rights of employers and workers.  The Arizona Contractor plaintiffs also asserted violations of the Commerce Clause, the Fourth Amendment and the Arizona state constitution.  Prior to consolidation, plaintiffs had requested a preliminary injunction in each case.  Defendants moved to dismiss the cases.\n\nOn February 7, 2008 Judge Wake found that federal immigration law did not preempt the Act, and it did not violate the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause. Arizona Contractors Ass'n, Inc. v. Candalaria, 534 F.Supp.2d 1036 (2008). Specifically, Judge Wake found that Section 1324a(h)(2) of the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) expressly authorized the Act at issue in this case.  The relevant section of the federal statute reads \"the provisions of this section preempt any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.\"  Judge Wake found that the Act was a licensing or similar law and thus fell within the federal statute's savings clause.  Furthermore, Judge Wake held that the Act's requirement of mandatory use of the federal E-Verify program did not conflict with federal objects or purposes, even though Congress had decided to make the program optional. \n\nOn appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, the plaintiffs renewed their argument that federal law expressly preempted the Act.  Moreover, the Act's mandatory requirement to use E-Verify, the plaintiffs contended, was impliedly preempted by federal law because it conflicts with the policies envisioned in the voluntary nature of the program under federal law.  On September 17, 2008 the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit (Judges Mary M. Schroeder, John M. Walker, Jr., and N. Randy Smith) affirmed the District Court's finding Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc. v. Napolitano, 558 F.3d 856 (2008).  In doing so, the Court of Appeals held that federal immigration law did not preempt the Act.  The court explained that the Act was not expressly preempted because it fell within ICRA's savings clause allowing for state licensing and similar laws to regulate the employment of unauthorized aliens.  Moreover, the court found that federal law does not impliedly preempt the Act's provision mandating the use of E-Verify.  The court found it telling that \"Congress could have, but did not, expressly forbid state laws from requiring E-Verify participation.\"  \n\nOn appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States and the named petitioners of the consolidated cases that made it to the Supreme Court, argued that the Court of Appeals had misinterpreted ICRA's savings clause and consequently had incorrectly ruled that the Act was not preempted.  Furthermore, the petitioners argued that even if the Act was not expressly preempted by ICRA, federal law impliedly preempted it because it conflicted with the structure and function of federal law.  The respondents replied in their brief that the Court of Appeals had been correct when it held that federal law did not preempt the Act.\n\nOn May 26, 2011 the United States Supreme Court, in an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Roberts, affirmed the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit's judgment. Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. Whiting, 131 S.Ct. 1968 (2011).  In doing so, the Court held that the Act fell within ICRA's savings clause and was thus not expressly preempted by federal law.  Specifically the Court found that \"The Arizona law, on its face, purports to impose sanctions through licensing laws[,]\" which placed it squarely within ICRA's savings clause that allowed for States to regulate the employment of unauthorized individuals through licensing and similar laws.  The Court was particularly unmoved by the petitioners' argument that the Act was not a licensing law because it only dealt with the revocation of licenses rather than the granting of them.  In fact, the Court flatly rejected that argument.  Moreover, the Court found that federal law did not impliedly preempt the Act because \"Arizona's procedures simply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly allowed Arizona to pursue through licensing laws.\"  Lastly, the Court found that the Act's requirement that employers use E-Verify was not impliedly preempted because it did not conflict with federal law.\n\nThe district court's dismissal of the matter therefore stood, and the case was ended.\n", "summary": "These 2007 consolidated cases were brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona to challenge the \"Legal Arizona Workers Act\", which mandates investigation and prosecution of employers who knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized aliens and requires the revocation of the licenses of employers found to have done so. It also makes mandatory a previously voluntary verification process.   The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' rulings, holding that the Act fell within ICRA's savings clause and thus was not expressly preempted by federal law."}
{"document": "On July 6, 2010, the United States filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Arizona against the State of Arizona and the Governor. The plaintiff, represented by the Department of Justice (DOJ), sought declaratory and injunctive relief, against the recently enacted S.B. 1070, which contained several provisions designed to \"discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens\" in Arizona. The DOJ argued that S.B. 1070 was a violation of the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and that it was preempted by federal law. The DOJ filed a motion for a preliminary injunction the same day to enjoin the defendant from enforcing S.B. 1070 until the Court made a determination as to its constitutionality. Specifically, the DOJ claimed that S.B. 1070 impermissibly infringed on the federal government's right to enact and enforce immigration policy. \n\nNote that this case was related to two others, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12123\">Friendly House v. Whiting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12125\">League of United Latin American Citizens v. Arizona</a>, in which plaintiffs filed suit against the State of Arizona also seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the implementation of S.B. 1070. \n\nOn July 28, 2010, the court (Judge Susan R. Bolton) granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (703 F.Supp.2d 980). The court found that the DOJ was not likely to succeed on the merits in showing that certain provisions of the legislation were preempted by federal law, but that the DOJ was likely to succeed on other provisions.  Some of the enjoined provisions included a portion of Section 2 of S.B. 1070 \"requiring that an officer make a reasonable attempt to determine the immigration status of a person stopped, detained or arrested if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is unlawfully present in the United States\" and Section 3 of S.B. 1070 \"requiring verification of the immigration status of any person arrested prior to releasing that person and creating a crime for the failure to apply for or carry alien registration papers.\"\n\nIn the two weeks immediately following the complaint filing, several groups filed motions for amicus briefs, including a collection of states in support of the defendants and the American Bar Association in support of the DOJ. The court denied these amicus pleadings in an order on September 3, 2010, as moot, because the court had not considered the briefs before issuing the preliminary injunction.  \n\nImmediately following the issuance of the preliminary injunction, the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit. The 9th Circuit (Judge Paez) upheld the district court's decision in an opinion filed on April 11, 2011. The court found that Congress intended for \"systematic state immigration enforcement (to) occur under the direction and close supervision of the Attorney General\" and that S.B. 1070 on its face impermissibly interfered with that intent. The court affirmed the preliminary injunction as issued by the district court. (641 F.3d 339)\n\nThe defendants appealed that ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted cert on December 12, 2011, and arguments were held April 25, 2012.  \n\nOn June 25, 2012, Justice Kennedy announced the decision of the Court, affirming in part and reversing in part. The Court held that several provisions of S.B. 1070 were properly enjoined but declined to strike down Section 2(B), which required state police to check the immigration status of people arrested under non-immigration state law. However, the Court did not uphold the provision either, instead deciding that if it was construed to not authorize extra detention time, it might be constitutional. (183 L.Ed.2d 351). On August 8, 2012, the Ninth Circuit (Judges John T. Noonan, Richard A. Paez, and Carlos T. Bea) returned the case to the district court for \"further proceedings consistent with the opinion and judgment of the Supreme Court.\" (2012 WL 3205612)\n\nOn September 18, 2012, pursuant to the stipulation between the parties and the prior Supreme Court ruling, the district court dissolved the preliminary injunction of Section 2(B) of S.B. 1070. The court also permanently enjoined Sections 3 and 6, which created criminal penalties for immigrant who did not federally register or carry federal registration documents, and authorized law enforcement officers to arrest without a warrant anyone they had probable cause to believe committed a removable public offense. \n\nOn March 7, 2013, the parties filed a joint status report indicating two of the plaintiff's claims remained unresolved: (1) plaintiff's claim regarding Section 2(B), and (2) plaintiff's claim against Section 4 of S.B. 1070, which amended the Arizona statute that established criminal penalties for \"smuggling of human beings for profit or commercial purpose.\" The parties agreed to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of plaintiff's claim against Section 2(B) in light of the Supreme Court decision. The parties proposed that adjudication of plaintiff's claim against Section 4 of S.B. 1070 be stayed pending the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>Valle del Sol, Inc. v. Whiting</i> (No. 12-17152), because the courts' resolution in that case was likely to have an effect on the smuggling provision in Section 4. The plaintiffs in that case challenged a portion of Section 5 of S.B. 1070 that imposes criminal penalties under certain circumstances for transporting or harboring an unlawfully present alien and encouraging or inducing an alien to enter or reside in Arizona in violation of law.\n\nOn October 8, 2013, the Ninth Circuit Court issued a decision in <i>Valle del Sol, Inc. v. Whiting</i>, 2013 WL 5526525. The court found that the challenged provision was both void for vagueness and preempted by federal law. The court therefore affirmed the district court's preliminary injunction against the provision. On April 21, 2014, the Supreme Court denied the writ of certiorari filed by the State and Governor of Arizona in <i>Valle del Sol</i>, thus ending any further review of the Ninth Circuit decision.\n\nOn May 29, 2014, the parties notified the court that they had reached an agreement in principle to resolve the plaintiff’s claims regarding Sections 2(B) and 5 of S.B. 1070, under which the United States dismissed without prejudice its facial challenge to Section 2(B) of S.B. 1070, and the defendants stipulated to a permanent injunction against implementation of Section 5 of S.B. 1070. The parties noted that they had not been able to reach any agreement regarding Section 4  of S.B. 1070. On June 9, 2014, the court ordered all claims in the United States’ complaint challenging on its face Section 2(B) of S.B. 1070 to be dismissed without prejudice and Section 5 be permanently enjoined.\n\nOn July 18, 2014, the U.S. moved for judgment regarding the one claim remaining in this action challenging Section 4 of S.B. 1070. On November 7, 2014, the court granted U.S.'s motion for judgment, stating that the Ninth Circuit’s holding in <i>Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting</i> dictated that federal law preempted the state law on both field and conflict preemption grounds. \n\nOn January 6, 2015, the defendants filed an appeal in 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but subsequently filed a motion to dismiss. The case is now closed.", "summary": "On July 6, 2010, the United States filed a lawsuit under the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution against the state of Arizona and the Governor of Arizona in her official capacity in the U.S. District Court of Arizona.

The U.S. Supreme Court granted cert on December 12, 2011 and issued their opinion on June 25, 2012.

{"document": "On May 17, 2010, a group of organizations and individuals filed this lawsuit against the sheriff and district attorney of each of the fifteen counties in Arizona, in their official capacities, in the U.S. District Court of Arizona. The plaintiff, represented by organizations such as the ACLU and the National Immigration Law Center along with private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the recently enacted S.B. 1070 was a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs claimed that S.B. 1070 conflicted with federal law and procedures and that local law enforcement agencies were ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of immigration law. For example, one provision of S.B. 1070 allowed police officers to ask for identification during a routine stop if there is a \"reasonable suspicion\" that the individual is not a U.S. citizen. The plaintiffs claimed that this provision was written primarily to provide a pretextual reason to stop an individual for some other state or local law violation in order to investigate that individual's immigration status. Immigration status, however, is not easily determined through an identification card of some kind—federal authorities may be aware of an individual's presence in the country but may not be pursuing deportation proceedings. The plaintiffs contended that local law enforcement lacked the training and knowledge to investigate immigration status. \n\nOn June 4, 2010, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. The court (Judge Susan R. Bolton) held a hearing on June 22, 2010, and stated that the motions would be held under advisement. On June 18, 2010, the court granted the State of Arizona and the governor's motions to intervene as defendants. \n\nOn June 25, 2010, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to transfer related case. In this order, the court allowed the transfer of four other cases challenging the constitutionality of S.B. 1070.\n\nOn October 8, 2010, the court granted in part and denied in part motions to dismiss filed by several of the defendants. The plaintiffs' first preliminary injunction motion, regarding certain provisions of S.B. 1070, was denied. At oral argument, the plaintiff withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction regarding part of S.B. 1070 based on the NInth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in <i>Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach</i>. The court found that a preliminary injunction was moot because an injunction was already issued in the related case <i>United States v. Arizona</i>. This case and <i>United States v. Arizona</i> challenged enforcement of the same provisions of S.B. 1070.  \n\nOn January 7, 2011, the plaintiffs filed another motion requesting a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendant from enforcing the provision of S.B. 1070 affected by the Redondo Beach case. On May 10, 2011, the court denied this motion without prejudice to its refiling at a later time because the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had not yet issued their opinion from the en banc court.\n\nIn October 2011, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and a third motion for a preliminary Injunction.\n\nOn February 29, 2012, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the defendants from enforcing A.R.S. § 13-2928 (A) and (B). This section of the law was intended to prevent employment solicitation on roadways where it interferes with the proper flow of traffic.  \n\nThe State of Arizona, as an intervenor-defendant, appealed the issuance of the preliminary injunction and, on May 9, 2012, filed their opening brief with the Ninth Circuit.\n\nThe plaintiff sought class action status in their original complaint and on December 12, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify class. While that motion was pending, on June 25, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in <i>Arizona v. United States</i>, affirming in part and reversing in part. The Court held that several provisions of S.B. 1070 were properly enjoined but declined to strike down Section 2(B), which required state police to check the immigration status of people arrested under nonimmigration state law. The Court explained that the legality of the provision would depend on how it was construed—if it did not authorize extra detention time, it may be constitutional.\n\nFollowing that Supreme Court decision, the plaintiffs in this case filed a motion for preliminary injunction on July 17, 2012, seeking an injunction against two sections of the law. The plaintiffs requested that the court preliminarily enjoin § 2(B) on preemption, Fourth Amendment, and Equal Protection Clause bases, and A.R.S. § 13-2929 on preemption grounds.\n\nOn March 27, 2013, the court affirmed the preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the day labor provisions. On April 9, 2013, the district court dismissed some of plaintiffs' claims in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in <i>Arizona v. United States</i>. The parties went through discovery and on March 17, 2015, the defendant moved for summary judgment with regard to plaintiffs' claims under the Supremacy Clause (Count One), Equal Protection Clause (Count Two), the First Amendment (Count Three), the Fourth Amendment (Count Four), Article II, Section 8 of the Arizona Constitution (Count Five), the Due Process Clause (Count Six), and 42 U.S.C. §1981 (Count Seven).\n\nOn September 4, 2015, the district court granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment for Counts One, Two, Four, Five, Six, and Seven. The district court, however, entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the claim in Count Three. In other words, the court found that plaintiffs had not presented any evidence that police would enforce S.B. 1070 differently for Latinos than other people and that the plaintiffs failed to prove that § 2(B) was unconstitutional. The court also found that parts of the law targeting day laborers violated the First Amendment free speech protections. \n\nThe parties filed cross-appeals to the Ninth Circuit. Before that appeal was decided, however, the plaintiffs and intervenor-defendants settled. The parties stipulated that the defendants would release an informal attorney general opinion, which would provide guidelines for the implementation of §§ 2(b) and 2(d) of S.B. 1070, among other sections. The parties also stipulated that A.R.S. §§ 28-3511A (1)(d) and (e) would be\nenjoined, and asked the court to enjoin those provisions. Finally, the plaintiffs would receive attorneys’ fees and costs totaling $1.4 million. On September 19, 2016, the court entered an order enforcing all of these stipulations.\n\nThere have been no further developments in this case; the case is presumably closed.", "summary": "On May 17, 2010, a group of organizations and individuals filed a lawsuit against the Sheriff and Attorney of each of the 15 counties in Arizona, in their official capacities, in the U.S. District Court of Arizona, Phoenix Division.

{"document": "This case challenged the hotel chain Motel 6 reporting guests to federal immigration officials. \n\nEight individuals who stayed separately at Arizona Motel 6 locations filed a class action lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on January 23, 2018. Suing under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, plaintiffs sued Motel 6 Operating L.P., its parent company G6 Hospitality LLC, and 10 unnamed Motel 6 employees in Arizona. The plaintiffs, represented by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), requested class certification, and sought declaratory, monetary, and injunctive relief, as well as a civil penalty and attorneys' fees and costs. Judge David G. Campbell was assigned.\n\nPlaintiffs claimed Motel 6's policy of disclosing guests' information to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) without requiring a warrant or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity violated the Fourth Amendment, as well as federal and state laws. Defendants allegedly violated 42 U.S.C. § 1981 by discriminating against plaintiff’s race or national origin by denying Latino guests the full and equal enjoyment of the contractual relationship with Motel 6. Additionally, by assisting DHS and ICE agents, the plaintiffs alleged that Motel 6 violated 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) by engaging in a conspiracy to violate the plaintiff's rights. Thirdly, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures by disclosing the plaintiffs' personal information to federal immigration officials without a warrant or reasonable suspicion of a crime. The plaintiffs also alleged a variety of state law violations, including various tort and breach of contract claims.\n\nThe parties filed a joint notice of settlement on July 6, 2018. A joint request for conditional class certification and preliminary approval of settlement terms was filed on July 6, 2018.\n\nPlaintiffs sought one primary class and two subclasses. The primary class consisted of all persons who stayed at a Motel 6 between February 1, 2017, and November 2, 2018, and had their information shared with federal immigration authorities. The first subclass was all persons who were questioned or interrogated by federal immigration authorities at a Motel 6 as a result of guest information being shared. The second subclass was for all persons who had been placed in immigration removal proceedings due to disclosed guest information and the resulting encounters with federal immigration authorities at a Motel 6.\n\nThe proposed settlement included a two-year enforcement period under a consent decree that would enjoin Motel 6 from providing guest information to DHS and ICE absent a warrant, subpoena, or the immediate risk of harm to a guest, employee, or another individual. Additionally, parties sought three categories of monetary damages totaling $7.6 million. First, $50 in damages per guest whose information was shared with federal immigration authorities, up to a class-wide total of $1,000,000. Second, $1,000 in damages to each class member questioned by federal immigration authorities during their stay. Finally, an amount of at least $7,500 to each Class Member who was placed in immigration removal proceedings in connection with their encounter with federal immigration authorities during their stay.\n\nOn May 30, 2019, the court mooted the parties' joint motion. The parties had advised the court that they would be filing a new motion for preliminary approval of a class settlement. \n\nPlaintiffs filed an amended class-action complaint on June 5, 2019. The amended complaint contains largely the same allegations and claims as in the original complaint. Plaintiffs now sought a primary class and one subclass. The primary class was all persons who stayed at a Motel 6 and had their information disclosed to federal immigration authorities between February 1, 2015, and the date of judgment in the present case. The subclass included guests at a Motel 6 that had been interrogated, arrested, or placed in removal proceedings by federal immigration authorities due to guest information being disclosed.\n\nThe parties again filed a joint motion for approval of the class action settlement and to certify class on July 5, 2019. The court granted preliminary approval of the class action settlement on August 2, 2019.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, the parties filed a joint motion requesting five actions. First, final approval of the settlement. Second, certification of the proposed classes. Third, a consent decree for injunctive relief. Fourth, authorization to distribute the settlement monetary damages in accordance with the agreement. Finally, payment of attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nThe court granted final approval of the third amended class action settlement on February 18, 2020. The court found that the amount of funds going to class members was sufficient and that the amount of funds held for four immigration rights organizations was \"consistent with the underlying objectives of the claims in this case, serves the interests of the silent class members, and is not too remote from the class.\"\n\nJudge Campbell signed a consent decree on February 18, 2020, making effective injunctive and recordkeeping provisions for three years. The injunctive provisions mandated Motel 6 do the following:<ul><li>Maintain a 24-hour hotline for employee use when they receive a federal request for guest information.</li><li>Not share any guest information with federal immigration authorities without a warrant, subpoena, or credible risk of imminent danger.</li><li>Motel 6 to create an online form for guests to report if guest information was improperly shared.</li><li>Maintain documentation related to reporting.</li><li>Annual meeting with parties to ensure compliance with consent decree.</li></ul>The parties attended the first required annual meetings on March 4, 2021.

{"document": "On March 16, 2018, a prisoner at the Coconino County Detention Facility (CCDF), in Flagstaff Arizona, filed this class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Coconino County, Arizona on behalf of himself and similarly situated prisoners. The complaint sought declaratory relief and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, challenging the prolonged detention of inmates for whom CCDF received a detainer from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE).  It named as defendants the Coconino County Sheriff, the Jail Commander, and other officials.  The plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU’s Immigrant Rights Project and by private counsel. \n\nThe complaint explained that the plaintiffs had been arrested, criminally. But then their detention at CCDF was prolonged because the facility cooperated with an ICE detainer request. The ICE detainers asked local authorities to prolong the confinement of individuals accused of immigration violations until officers from ICE took custody of those individuals and placed them in removal proceedings. The named plaintiff, for example, claimed that there were people willing to post bond to secure his release, but they were told by CCDF personnel that he would be held for an additional 48 hours following the bond payment pursuant to the ICE detainer request. Fearing that posting bond would trigger the 48-hour hold and subsequent detention by ICE, he chose to remain in custody until his trial date.\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs, CCDF’s policy of prolonging plaintiffs’ detention despite meeting all conditions of pretrial release violated Article II, section 8 of the Arizona Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs requested preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, to secure the named plaintiff’s immediate release upon the payment of his bond. and to enjoin the holding of other similarly situated detainees pursuant to CCDF’s policy. The plaintiffs also sought a court declaration that  the CCDF detainer policy was unlawful. \n\nBecause the complaint raised a federal claim, the defendants removed it to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on April 2, 2018. It was assigned to District Judge David Campbell. On April 6, 2018, the plaintiffs sought an order to show cause as to their request for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order and to halt the continued implementation the CCDF’s immigration detention policies. The plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on April 30, 2018. In addition to repeating the allegations described in the original complaint, the amended complaint also asserted that CCDF’s polices violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n \nOn May 5, 2018, the U.S. Government filed a statement of interest, seeking to convince the District Court to deny the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. According to the Government, ICE’s cooperation with local law enforcement in the detention of those accused of immigration violations was lawful under Arizona and federal law. Though the detainer authorized the confinement of an individual 48 hours beyond the time when the individual would have otherwise been released, the Government clarified that the detainer should not, “impact decisions about the alien’s bail, rehabilitation, parole, release, diversion, custody classification, work, quarter assignments, or other matters.” Further, the Government claimed that the named plaintiff did not have a basis to challenge the legality of ICE’s cooperation with the County, because he never elected to post bond. \n\nOn July 6, 2018, Judge Campbell denied the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction. According to the Court, the plaintiffs were unable to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, but nonetheless raised serious questions that required further litigation. The Court reached this decision by finding the plaintiffs’ arguments inconclusive as to whether Arizona sheriffs possessed common law authority to cooperate with ICE without explicit statutory authorization. However, the Court also held that local law enforcement officers’ unilateral authority to prolong the detention of an individual on immigration grounds absent a formalized agreement with the federal government was a serious question demanding further litigation. Because both the plaintiffs and the Government would sustain significant hardships on account of the absence or presence of court interference, the Court concluded that a preliminary injunction would not be appropriate relief in this case. 324 F.Supp.3d 1053.\n\nOn July 30, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to dismiss the case, to which the defendants provided no objection. According to plaintiffs’ counsel (as reported in local news sources), the denial of the preliminary injunction made the dismissal necessary. They explained that continuing to fight the case would result in their client spending another six months to a year in jail. The Court granted the motion, dismissing the case as to the defendants without prejudice. The case is now closed.\n", "summary": "Following his arrest and confinement at the Coconino County Detention Facility (CCDF), plaintiff challenged the prolonged detention of inmates at CCDF triggered by detainer requests from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE).

He sought class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief for all CCDF detainees subject to this prolonged detention policy despite their eligibility for pretrial release. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. District Court for the district of Arizona denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, citing his inability to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his claims.

{"document": "On May 23, 2018 the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California (ACLU-NC) filed this lawsuit against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The ACLU brought suit in the U.S. District Court for Northern California seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. ACLU-NC requested records relating to ICE’s purchase of two private databases of automated license plate reader (ALPR) data. The complaint stated that “[t]he potential use by ICE of data for civil immigration enforcement, an entirely different purpose for which it was originally collected by local police—local criminal investigations—has generated widespread media interest and public concern.” The complaint maintained that access to information about ICE’s use of ALPR databases was necessary to inform meaningful public debate over the scope of government conduct.”\n\nAccording to the complaint, ACLU-NC submitted FOIA requests on March 19, 2018 and March 21, 2018. The requests sought records including impact assessments and communications between ICE and the vendor of ALPR data. ACLU-NC had yet to receive the requested information at the time of the complaint. ICE contended that, following the initial filing of the complaint, ACLU-NC had access to an interim release of records that occurred on July 13, 2018. In addition, ICE argued that further requested information may be exempt from public disclosure. As a result, ICE moved to dismiss the complaint all together.\n\nThe parties later agreed that the remainder of the requested documents would be released on a rolling basis. ACLU-NC received the documents by November 2018. On February 26, 2019, Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero granted a stipulation and settlement reached by the parties. The agreement required ICE to pay ACLU-NC $8,597.68 in attorneys' fees and would dismiss the case with prejudice.

{"document": "On March 27, 2018, immigrant detainees who had been held for more than six months without a bond hearing during the pendency of their removal proceedings petitioned the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California for a writ of habeas corpus; they also sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Represented by Centro Legal de la Raza, the American Civil Liberties Union of California, and private counsel, the plaintiffs brought this class action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2241, and 1651. \n\nThe named plaintiffs were San Francisco Bay area fathers who had been arrested by ICE in fall 2017 and were subsequently detained for over six months without a bond hearing. The government was prohibited from deporting them because an Asylum Officer found that they each had a “reasonable fear of persecution.” Consequently, they had live claims in the Immigration Court and were fighting deportation in “withholding only” proceedings. They had also moved for bond hearings in their cases before the Immigration Court, but their motions were denied for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a court order requiring that the defendants provide individualized bond hearings before an Immigration Judge after 180 days of detention and every 180 days thereafter if denied. The plaintiffs also sought a declaration that failure to provide such a hearing violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the statutory requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 5 U.S.C. § 703. Once filed, the case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley.\n\nOn April 12, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify a class of “all individuals who are detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6) in the Ninth Circuit by, or pursuant to the authority of, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), and who have reached or will reach six months in detention, and have been or will be denied a prolonged detention bond hearing before an Immigration Judge.” The class was defined to exclude classes of similarly-situated individuals involved in other litigation, such as Rodriguez v. Hayes, available <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12492\">here</a> in this Clearinghouse and which reached the Supreme Court as Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018).  The relevant statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6), authorizes the detention of individuals with final orders of removal. However, the plaintiffs in this case challenged their removal orders and, as a result, the government was prohibited from deporting them. On the same date, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the government from continuing to detain class members for over 180 days without a bond hearing. \n\nThe defendants filed their opposition to these motions on May 3, 2018. The parties’ primary disagreement related to whether the Supreme Court decision in <i>Jennings</i> had effectively overturned Ninth Circuit precedent on this issue. Specifically, the plaintiffs relied on the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>Diouf II</i> which held that an individual facing prolonged detention (i.e., over 180 days) under 8 U.S.C. section 1231(a)(6) “is entitled to release on bond unless the government establishes that he is a flight risk or a danger to the community.” Diouf v. Napolitano, 634 F.3d 1081, 1082 (9th Cir. 2011). The plaintiffs filed their reply on May 17, 2018. \n\nOn June 5, 2018, Judge Corley found that <i>Jennings</i> did not overrule <i>Diouf II</i> and that they were not irreconcilable. She granted a preliminary injunction and class certification so that people who have been detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6) with “live claims” (i.e., before the Immigration Court, Board of Immigration Appeals, or a circuit court of appeals) cannot be held by the government for more than 180 days without a bond hearing before an Immigration Judge. At these hearings, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would bear the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that prolonged detention was warranted (i.e., that a detainee is a flight risk or a danger to the community). According to the ACLU, the ruling is expected to affect hundreds of people detained throughout the Ninth Circuit. According to Centro Legal de la Raza, this order does not extend to arriving aliens held under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b) or mandatory detainees held under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). 325 F.R.D. 616.\n\nOn July 20, 2018, Judge Corley issued an order clarifying her June 5, 2018 in response to a motion for clarification filed by the defendants on June 20, 2018. She ordered that the preliminary injunction applied only to immigration detainees who have “live claims” before an adjudicative body, and not to <i>any</i> detainee held in ICE custody for over 180 days. \n\nOn August 3, 2018, the defendants appealed the class certification and injunction to the Ninth Circuit (docket no. 18-16465).\n\nOn November 16, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion in the district court requesting enforcement of the court's June 5 order as to class members transferred to detention facilities outside of the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit. The plaintiffs claimed that, as class members, they are entitled to the protection of the court's order. Defendants argued that upon transfer outside the Ninth Circuit they are no longer class members and no longer entitled to prolonged detention bond hearings after 180 days.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Judge Corley denied the plaintiffs' motion. In her order, she explained that the plaintiffs' reading of the certified class was too broad to embrace class members transferred outside of the Ninth Circuit, and that the plaintiffs had not shown that the defendants had otherwise failed to comply with the June 5 order. 2019 WL 330466.\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the District Court further required the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with a class list periodically in order to demonstrate compliance. \n\nOn April 7, 2020 the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the district court's June 5, 2018 order. The Court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that § 1231(a)(6) requires the government to provide class members with an individualized bond hearing in accordance with <i>Diouf II</i>. It also agreed that <i>Diouf II</i> was not clearly irreconcilable with <i>Jennings</i> and that the burden was on the government to show that a detained class member was a flight risk or a danger in order to continue holding them without violating due process. 2020 WL 1684034. \n\nBack in the district court, on April 10, 2020, the plaintiffs moved to enforce and amend the preliminary injunction. On June 19, 2020, this motion was granted in part and denied in part. 2020 WL 3402227. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought to require the defendants to do three things: (1) hold bond hearings within seven days of a class member's 180th day in detention; (2) notify class members of their scheduled bond hearings by their 165th day in detention and (3) explain any delays in bond hearings that occur after seven days of a class member's 180th; day. The court denied the plaintiffs' second request (notification of their scheduled bond hearing by their 165th day in detention), reasoning that a detainee did not become a class member until their 180th day and thus relief could not be granted to non-class members. The court observed that the defendants were able to provide the vast majority of class members with a hearing within 15 days of their 180th day; thus, the court amended the June 2018 order to require an explanation by the defendants when they failed to provide a bond hearing within 15 days of a class member's 180th day in detention. Further, the court amended the June 2018 order to require defendants to post a notice of the preliminary injunction in detention facilities that includes a list of the requirements to qualify as a class member so that detainees may pro se identify their class membership in the event that the defendants erred in identification. \n\nThe court further required the defendants to more clearly report bond hearing outcomes. Specifically, classifications of \"no action\" were required to be changed so that a clearer result of the hearings would be known. The court, however, denied the plaintiffs' motion as it pertained to requiring more information regarding how the defendants identified potential class members, reasoning that such heightened requirements were unnecessary. \n\nOn September 11, 2020, the defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court asking them to review the Ninth Circuit's April 2020 affirmance of the preliminary injunction. No. 20-322. As of April 16, 2021, this case is ongoing.", "summary": "Two San Francisco Bay Area fathers filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California after being detained for over 6 months in ICE custody without a bond hearing.

The government appealed both orders to the Ninth Circuit, and on April 7, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's order.

{"document": "On April 18, 2018, a group of five unnamed plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sought to represent a class of Iranian refugees and their U.S.-based family members who applied for refugee resettlement through the Vienna, Austria-based Lautenberg-Specter program and were denied. The plaintiffs alleged that they had applied for refugee resettlement through the Lautenberg program for members of Iranian religious minorities and had traveled to Vienna for processing. But they received mass denial notices in February 2018 with the sole explanation that the applications were denied “as a matter of discretion.” They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the denial notices violated the Lautenberg Amendment, the <i>Accardi</i> doctrine (agency cannot violate its own regulations), and Fifth Amendment due process. The plaintiffs were represented by counsel from the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) and the law firm Latham and Watkins LLP. \n\nThe Lautenberg Amendment designates certain vulnerable groups, including certain persecuted religious minorities, for whom less evidence is needed to establish refugee status. If an application for refugee status submitted under the provision is denied, the Lautenberg Amendment requires that the denial be made in writing and “state, to the maximum extent feasible, the reason for the denial.” Under the Lautenberg-Specter program, which extends the protections of the Lautenberg Amendment to Iranian religious minorities, U.S. residents submit an application on behalf of refugee applicants in Iran. Once applicants pass an initial screening, they travel to Vienna where their applications can be processed by the U.S. government. In the years prior to the events at issue in this case, applications submitted through the program had had a near 100 percent admittance rate. The plaintiffs' denials came after many of them had been waiting in Vienna for nearly a year, and now many of them are at risk of deportation back to Iran. \n\nOn April 20, 2018, the plaintiffs sought class certification and partial summary judgment on their Lautenberg Amendment, <i>Accardi</i> doctrine, and Fifth Amendment due process claims. In response, DHS argued that all three claims were nonjusticiable because decisions over whether to admit or deny noncitizens outside the U.S. are immune from judicial review. In the alternative, DHS opposed class certification on the grounds that the Iranian plaintiffs and the U.S. plaintiffs were in fundamentally different positions, and that the wide array of familial relationships between the U.S. and Iranian class members meant that the five plaintiffs could not adequately represent the interests of the class. DHS also opposed partial summary judgment on the grounds that the “as a matter of discretion” language in the notices complied with the Lautenberg Amendment’s requirement to explain the reason for the denial to the maximum extent feasible, and that the DHS regulations cited by the plaintiffs did not apply to this case.\n\nOn July 10, 2018, the district court (Judge Beth Labson Freeman) granted the motion for class certification, and granted partial summary judgment as to the plaintiffs’ Lautenberg Amendment and <i>Accardi</i> claims, while declining to rule on their due process claim. 357 F.Supp.3d 972. Judge Freeman explained that DHS’s nonjusticiability arguments were not on point, because the plaintiffs were not challenging the decisions to admit or deny the applications, but were rather alleging that DHS failed to comply with the Lautenberg Amendment and the applicable regulations. She sided with the plaintiffs’ arguments that the “as a matter of discretion” explanation contained in the notices did not comply with the Lautenberg Amendment’s mandate to give the reasons for the denial “to the maximum extent feasible,” because it effectively prevented plaintiffs from requesting agency review. With respect to the <i>Accardi</i> doctrine claim, Judge Freeman also pointed out that DHS’ own regulations require it to advise refugee applicants of any derogatory facts on which an adverse decision is based; she rejected DHS’s arguments that the regulations at issue were inapplicable to the plaintiffs. Citing the fact that she already fully disposed of plaintiff’s claims on statutory grounds, she declined to reach the plaintiff’s due process claim. Judge Freeman thus set aside the February 2018 notices of denial as unlawful, and ordered DHS to re-issue new notices within 14 days containing their determinations to re-open processing or deny the plaintiffs’ refugee applications.\n\nDHS filed an appeal to the partial summary judgment motion and the class certification with the Ninth Circuit on September 18, 2018. DHS moved to dismiss the appeal voluntarily on November 16, 2018, and the Ninth Circuit filed the dismissal on November 20.\n\nMeanwhile, discovery continued in the District Court. Discovery was fairly contentious with several motions to claw back, sequester, and compel; Magistrate Judge Virginia K. Demarchi assessed sanctions of $41,546.52 in attorney's fees against DHS on October 31, 2019.

{"document": "This case is another response to efforts by the Trump Administration to strip certain law enforcement funding from \"sanctuary\" cities and states unless their governments agree to participate in federal immigration enforcement. The city and county of San Francisco previously sued the Department of Justice (DOJ) over immigration conditions imposed on the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) program twice in 2017, details of those cases can be found  <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15608\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16095\">here</a>.\n\nOn August 22, 2018, the city and county of San Francisco filed this lawsuit in the Northern District of California. San Francisco, represented by the city attorney, sued Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Acting Assistant Attorney General, the United States Department Justice (DOJ), and dozens of unnamed defendants also allegedly responsible for unconstitutionally conditioning grants of federal funding. San Francisco claimed that this violated the Spending Clause, separation of powers, and the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge William Orrick. It was related to a similar case brought by the state of California on Sept. 10, 2018; that case can be found <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16743\">here</a>.\n\nSan Francisco alleged that the defendants were again imposing unlawful immigration-related conditions on Byrne JAG grants (federal funds that go to a number of criminal justice programs in San Francisco) for fiscal year 2018. The plaintiff stated that several of these conditions were essentially the same as those imposed on FY2017 grants, but that the defendants had additionally imposed two new conditions. Those additional conditions require Byrne JAG recipients: (1) not to publicly disclose sensitive federal law enforcement information in attempts to harbor or shield fugitives from justice or aliens in violation of federal immigration law; and (2) to provide information about the applicant’s laws and policies for purposes of assessing compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 (which bars local governments from restricting their employees from sharing citizenship and immigration status information with federal immigration authorities). These conditions are referred to as the “nondisclosure” and “information” conditions, respectively. Failure to cooperate with these conditions would deny the plaintiff up to $1.4 million in Byrne JAG funds for FY2018. The plaintiff claimed that compliance conflicted with existing state and county laws. \n\nOn December 21, 2018, the City and County of San Francisco moved for summary judgment. Oral argument on that motion was scheduled for February 13, 2019. \n\nOn March 4, 2019, Judge Orrick granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants' motion for partial dismissal or partial summary judgment. Judge Orrick found that the challenged conditions were ultra vires and violated the separation of powers; that 8 U.S.C. § 1373 was unconstitutional; that the Attorney General exceeded the Spending Clause by imposing ambiguous conditions on Byrne JAG grants in FY2018; that the conditions were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; that California was entitled to the mandamus relief it was seeking in its related case; and that a nationwide injunction was warranted but stayed. \n\nJudge Orrick focused his analysis on the two new conditions imposed for FY2018, incorporating by reference the arguments related to the duplicate conditions from FY2017. The DOJ relied on three statutory provisions to support its conclusion that Congress had delegated authority to the Assistant Attorney General to exercise discretion over formula grants, but Judge Orrick concluded that these provisions did not grant such an independent authority to impose the FY2018 conditions on Byrne JAG grants. \n\nOn March 26, 2019, Judge Orrick issued his permanent injunction, enjoining the defendants from using the FY2018 Byrne JAG funding conditions for any California state entity, San Francisco, any California political subdivision, or any jurisdiction in the United States. The judge then stayed the nationwide aspect of the permanent injunction until further rulings from the Ninth Circuit (which had expressed concerns over the nationwide nature of the relief during the 2017 litigation over Byrne JAG funding conditions). \n\nOn May 3, 2019, the defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit (Docket No. 19-15947). The parties subsequently entered mediation conferences. In November 2019, the Ninth Circuit stayed the appeals.

{"document": "On February 14, 2019, a group of asylum seekers from Central America and several legal organizations filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). \n\nThe plaintiffs challenged the Trump Administration’s new policy of forcing asylum seekers to return to Mexico while they await their removal proceedings: the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). The plaintiff individual asylum seekers are currently residing in Mexico after having entered the U.S. to request asylum, and then been returned to Mexico under the MPP. The plaintiffs alleged that these asylum seekers are living in fear in Mexico, and that the plaintiff legal organizations are being thwarted from providing representation to such asylum seekers by the physical removal of them from the U.S. \n\nThe case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero, and then reassigned to Judge Richard Seeborg on Feb. 19.\n\nOn Feb. 20, 2019 the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to enjoin the MPP until a preliminary injunction could be obtained. The plaintiffs alleged that the MPP violate the section of the INA that purportedly authorizes them, violated the U.S.’s duty of non-return, constituted arbitrary and capricious decision making under the APA, and violated the APA’s notice and comment requirements. The defendants filed their response on March 1. The judge held a hearing on the motion on March 22. On March 28, 2019 the judge issued an order requesting expedited further briefing on the issue of whether jurisdiction of this case lies exclusively in the District of Columbia. \n\nOn April 8, 2019 Judge Seeborg issued an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 366 F. Supp. 3d 1110. The judge found that the INA section vesting DHS with the authority in some circumstances to return certain aliens to a contiguous territory (8 USC § 1225(b)(2)(C)) could not be read to apply to the plaintiff asylum seekers or others similarly situated. Additionally, he found that even if that statute could be applied to the plaintiffs, the MPP still need to be enjoined because they fail to sufficiently protect immigrants from being returned to places where their lives or freedom are at risk (in violation of the U.S.'s non-refoulement obligations). Judge Seeborg therefore enjoined the defendants from implementing the MPP nationwide and ordered that the named individual plaintiffs be permitted to enter the U.S.\n\nThe defendants appealed the order to the Ninth Circuit and requested a stay of the preliminary injunction pending the appeal. On May 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit granted a stay of the injunction. 924 F.3d 503. The panel found that the defendants were likely to prevail on the merits of the plaintiffs' INA and APA claims. It stated that the plaintiff asylum seekers were properly subjected to the contiguous-territory provision of the INA, and that the MPP were exempt from the notice-and-comment requirement because they are general statements of policy.\n\nOn July 15, 2019, the district court agreed to stay proceedings in the case until the Ninth Circuit appeal was resolved.\n\nOn February 28, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's nationwide injunction of the Migrant Protection Protocols. 951 F.3d 1073. The Court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their INA claims because the INA's contiguous territory return provision does not apply to bona fide asylum seekers, and that the MPP do not comply with the U.S.'s treaty-based non-return obligations codified in the INA. The Court also found that the nationwide scope of the preliminary injunction, which in practical effect would operate in only the four states along the southern border where the MPP are enforced, was warranted. \n\nHowever, that same day, the government filed an emergency motion requesting either a stay pending disposition of a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court, or an immediate administrative stay. The Ninth Circuit granted an administrative stay that evening and requested expedited briefing by the parties addressing the government's request for a longer stay. \n\nOn March 4, 2020, the Ninth Circuit granted in part and denied in part the requested stay. 951 F.3d 1073. The Ninth Circuit denied the stay with respect to the merits of its February 28 holding that the MPP violate federal law. However, it issued a stay of the injunction insofar as it operates outside the boundaries of the Ninth Circuit; this stay was set to begin on March 12.\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order halting the Ninth Circuit's injunction of the MPP. 140 S.Ct. 1564. Consequently, the MPP remain in effect nationwide.  \n\nOn April 10, 2020, the government filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

{"document": "On June 16, 2019, plaintiffs--three immigration attorneys and two noncitizens who filed FOIA (FOIA) requests for individual immigration case files (known as A-Files)--filed this class-action suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (UCIS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), alleging that the defendants had a nationwide pattern or practice of failing to make determinations regarding A-File requests within the time period of 30 days as mandated by 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(b), the FOIA statute. Plaintiffs, represented by the American Immigration Council and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, sought declaratory relief that defendants’ failure to make timely determinations on plaintiffs’ and proposed classes’ A-File FOIA requests violates FOIA, and a nationwide injunction requiring defendants to make timely determinations. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that A-Files are crucial to determining a noncitizen's eligibility to apply for an immigration benefit and to change their existing immigration status. The only way that a noncitizen or her attorney can obtain an A-File is to submit an FOIA request. UCIS' FOIA backlog--which more than doubled between 2015 and 2017, despite no increase in requests--had resulted in average processing time for FOIA requests of 55-90 days, exceeding the 30-day deadline. The plaintiffs also asserted that UCIS exacerbated these delays by referring portions of requests to ICE, which also has a considerable backlog, resulting in further delay and incomplete record retrieval. The plaintiffs alleged that these backlogs and delays demonstrate a pattern or practice of unreasonable delay in responding to FOIA requests and that these delays caused \"emotional and financial hardship for individuals left in legal limbo\" while waiting to obtain these records. \n\nOn July 2, 2019, the case was reassigned to Judge William H. Orrick because the parties did not consent to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge. \n\nOn August 8, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification, seeking certification for two proposed classes. The first proposed class (\"USCIS Class\") consisted of \"all individuals who filed, or will file, A-File FOIA requests with USCIS which have been pending, or will be pending, with USCIS for more than 30 business days without a determination.\" The second proposed class (\"ICE Referral Class\") consisted of \"All individuals who filed, or will file, A-File FOIA requests with USCIS that USCIS has referred, or will refer, to ICE and which have been pending, or will be pending, for more than 30 business days from the date of the initial filing with USCIS without a determination.\"\n\nOn October 15, 2019, Judge Orrick granted the Motion for Class Certification, concluding that the plaintiffs met their burden for certification of both the \"USCIS Class\" and the \"ICE Referral Class.\" 2019 WL 5191066.\n\nDiscovery took place over the summer of 2020 and on September 30, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion of summary judgment. The defendants responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment on October 21.\n\nOn December 17, 2020, Judge Orrick issued an opinion and order granting the plaintiff's motion and denying the defendants. Finding that the defendants systematically failed to meet statutory FOIA deadlines, Judge Orrick granted the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief. Judge Orrick also enjoined the defendants from failing to meet FOIA deadlines, ordered them to make determinations on all backlogged FOIA requests within 60 days of his order, and ordered them to make quarterly reports on their compliance with the FOIA.\n\nThe defendant's first status report is due on March 17, 2021, and Judge Orrick scheduled a case management conference for April 6, 2021.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a lawsuit brought by the University of California regents regarding the July 2020 release of ICE regulations which, in effect, meant that students on F-1 visas would risk deportation if their school shifted to online learning. In a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, the plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance and as a result, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs in this case continued to monitor the alterations ICE made to its website between July and September and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on October 6, 2020. <hr>\n\n<b>Background</b>\nGenerally speaking, F-1 visas (colloquially \"student visas\") can be granted to international students who attend American universities. However, regulations on the granting of these visas limit the amount of online or distance learning the student can engage in. According to these regulations, an international student can engage in only one such class or three credits of that class per semester. 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G).\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 made this regulation untenable, as schools and universities had to shift to online learning systems. In response, defendant ICE issued an exemption on March 13, 2020, affirming that international students would be permitted to continue distance learning in the United States under their F-1 visas. The exemption would apply until the end of the emergency. However, on July 6, 2020, ICE issued a new directive stating that it would rescind that exemption. This directive would then mean that international students at schools that would still be fully online would have to either transfer to other schools that were at least partially in-person, go back to their countries voluntarily, or risk deportation. The directive also ordered schools that had gone fully online or had simply decided not to have classes to submit an \"operational change plan\" within nine days, and ordered schools that would have a hybrid system to certify each F-1 student to make sure that they were not taking entirely online courses.\n\n<b>The Lawsuit</b>\nIn response to the new directive, The Regents of the University of California filed this lawsuit on July 10, 2020. They were represented by private and in-house counsel. The University sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Plaintiffs argued that the new directive violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in two ways. First, the directive was arbitrary and capricious. According to the plaintiffs, the directive failed to consider important aspects of the problem. It also did not address the reliance interests of higher education institutions that put resources into devising public health and safety plans for the upcoming year and it lacked any reasonable basis for the shift in policy. Second, the plaintiffs claimed that defendants failed to comply with notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures when they issued the new directive which violated the APA. Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, an order vacating and setting aside the new directive, an order preventing the defendants from enforcing the the directive, and attorney's fees and costs.\n\nSimultaneously, the plaintiffs submitted an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the new policy. They also filed a motion to shorten the time for consideration of the temporary restraining order and argued that the court must take immediate action to avoid doing irreparable harm to the academic community. The case was assigned to Judge Jeffrey S. White after plaintiffs decline to proceed before a magistrate judge.\n\nOn July 13, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The next day the case was related to <a href= \"https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17694\">State of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a> and re-assigned to Judge Jon S.

Defendants were the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the new directive violated the Administrative Procedure Act in four ways: 1) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to consider reliance interests of F-1 and M-1 visa holders; 2) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to offer a reasoned basis to justify the policy; 3) defendants did not engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking when coming up with the new policy; and 4) the directive violated the Fifth Amendment in that it stripped plaintiffs of their visas without due process of law. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the agencies from enforcing the new directive. Plaintiffs also requested that the court vacate and set aside the new directive, in addition to declaratory relief and attorney's fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Cormac J.

However, in an amendment to the students' application for a temporary restraining order, they noted that despite the removal, the government failed to issue a formal statement of rescission or explanation and failed to issue a statement confirming that the March guidance would remain in effect for the duration of the emergency. They sought an order directing the government to administer the student visa program in accordance with the March guidance for the duration of the emergency.\n\nThe government filed a motion to dismiss and opposition to the students' application for a temporary restraining order.

{"document": "In March 2018, Secretary Ross and the Department of Commerce announced that a citizenship question would be added to the 2020 Census, because of a request from the Department of Justice for data to enforce the Voting Rights Act. A number of lawsuits followed, culminating in the Supreme Court affirming that the asserted reason for including the citizenship question — to aid in Voting Rights Act enforcement — was pretextual. Subsequently, President Trump, in a continued effort to attempt to exclude immigrants from the 2020 Census count, issued a Presidential Memorandum on July 21, 2020 entitled “Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census.\" This memorandum essentially sought to accomplish the same ends as the 2018 action by the Department of Commerce.

I § 1 and U.S. Const. art. II § 3,  as well as violating the Census Act.

The plaintiff was an organization \"dedicated to protecting and defending the civil rights of individuals and educating the public concerning civil rights issues.\" Represented by its own counsel and by the private law firm Ballard Spahr, the plaintiff filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.\n\nAccording to the plaintiff, DHS operated many immigrant detention centers nationwide, including one in Adelanto, CA (the Adelanto Detention Facility [ADF]) in contract with the private-prison corporation GEO Group, and one in Gadsen, AL (the Etowah County Detention Center [ECDC]) in contract with the county sheriff's office. In both facilities, many detainees had alleged substandard conditions including inadequate medical care and mental health care, solitary confinement, and sexual assault. These conditions allegedly led to the death of detained individuals. The plaintiff sought information on conditions of confinement and the individuals detained at these facilities to inform public debate on the issue.\n\nThe plaintiff alleged that it had submitted several FOIA requests to ICE on Aug. 15 and Sept. 29, 2017, seeking records related to both the detention centers. The complaint further claimed that, to date, the plaintiff had not received a substantive response from any of the defendant agencies and that the plaintiff had constructively exhausted all required administrative remedies. The plaintiff sought a disclosure order under FOIA, legal fees, and expedited action.\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2018, this case was assigned to Judge Richard P. Matsch. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 29. In the amended complaint, the plaintiff included additional facilities run by DHS whose agency records and data had not been made public despite plaintiffs’ FOIA requests. These facilities included the Denver Contract Detention Facility, located in Aurora, Colorado, which was operated by the defendants pursuant to a contract with GEO. Additionally, the Theo Lacy Facility, located in Orange County, California, was also added to the complaint. There, too, the defendants refused to make public agency records in response to the plaintiff's FOIA requests. The Theo Lacy Facility was operated by the defendants through a contract with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. The plaintiff alleged that both facilities have been the subject of numerous complaints, investigations by nongovernmental civil rights organizations, and reports concerning substandard conditions of confinement.  \n\nThe plaintiff also alleged noncompliance with a FOIA request seeking agency records as to the conditions of confinement at all facilities used by ICE for the detention of individuals during their immigration proceedings. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants exceeded the mandated statutory deadline as to all FOIA requests submitted as of the time of the filing of the first amended complaint. Accordingly, the plaintiff requested that the court declare the defendants' withholding of the requested records unlawful and enjoin any further noncompliance. Further, the plaintiff requested that the court order the defendants to make the records subject to the FOIA requests in controversy available and award the plaintiff costs and attorneys’ fees.\n\nOn May 30, 2019 this suit was reassigned to Judge John L. Kane. The plaintiff moved for leave to file second amended complaint on July 5, 2019. The defendants responded in opposition to the motion on Aug. 9, 2019.  \n\nOn Sept. 16, 2019, the plaintiff and defendants filed a joint notice of potential partial settlement. While tentative, the proposal indicated that the plaintiff may withdraw its motion for sanctions and the discovery order to produce documents. It would also end the litigation surrounding the plaintiff’s opposed motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.\n\nOn January 16, 2020, Judge Kane ordered that the parties file a joint status report by February 3, 2020, indicating whether it remains necessary for the Court to rule on the plaintiff's pending motions. On February 3, 2020, the court ordered the plaintiff's motions for sanctions and order to produce documents to be withdrawn as moot. Additionally, the court stated that if an agreement could not be reached as to the documents in question the defendants should then move for summary judgment.\n\nBefore filing for summary judgment, the parties were able to reach a resolution on the plaintiff’s FOIA requests on May 6, 2020. However, the parties could not reach an agreement regarding plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and cost. The plaintiff’s filed a motion for attorneys’ fees and costs on June 8, 2020.

Frank Legal Services Organization of the Yale Law School, filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (\"FOIA\"), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, seeking to compel the release of government records regarding the immigration enforcement policies, practices, and activities of the Immigration and Custom Enforcement Division of the Department of Homeland Security (\"ICE\") in and around New Haven, Connecticut. Specifically, Plaintiffs sought the release of records relating to a June 6, 2007 immigration raid in New Haven, Connecticut, in which 29 individuals were arrested and detained.  Plaintiffs alleged that the raid came on the heels of the approval of a municipal identification card program in New Haven. The Government filed an answer, generally denying Plaintiffs' allegations.  \n\nIn April of 2008, the Government moved for summary judgment. During oral argument, the District Court (Judge Mark R. Kravitz) suggested he conduct an in camera review of certain categories of documents in dispute. In September of 2008, the Court issued its Ruling on Documents Submitted In Camera, holding that certain categories of documents containing individually identifiable information were properly withheld from disclosure, but that certain email documents were not exempt from disclosure. Unidad Latina En Acción v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 253 F.R.D. 44 (D. Conn. 2008). The Court instructed the parties to use this ruling as a guide for resolving similar disputes.\n\nOn December 9, 2008, the Court (Judge Kravitz) entered its ruling on the adequacy of the Government's search. The Court ordered the Government to submit an additional declaration detailing three discrete aspects of its search, but stated that once the Government did so, it would be inclined to grant summary judgment on the adequacy of the search. However, the Plaintiffs then moved for relief from the order, stating that the Government had included false statements in one of the declarations that the Court had relied upon. The Court subsequently granted the Plaintiffs' motion and allowed them to depose certain ICE FOIA officers on the adequacy of the Government's search. The Government also withdrew its summary judgment motion insofar as it pertained to the adequacy of the search. \n\nOn January 30, 2009, the Court (Judge Kravitz) ruled on its second in camera review based on a certain set of redactions in the Government's documents. The Court ordered that the redactions were appropriate where the individually identifiable information could be matched to individuals, but held it was inappropriate to withhold such information when it was already in the public domain. With this ruling, the Court denied the Government's summary judgment motion as moot, as it had now conducted two in camera reviews and the Government had withdrawn another aspect of its motion.\n\nThe Government then submitted a third round of documents for the Court's review, with the dispute now centered on the scope of Plaintiffs' FOIA request. On March 27, 2009, the Court entered a text order stating that, for reasons stated during oral argument, the Government had properly withheld certain documents but not others.\n\nIn late May 2009, following the depositions of the ICE FOIA officers, the parties had worked out an agreement regarding the adequacy of the Government's searches. By November, the parties stipulated that, with the exception of costs and attorneys fees, no further relief was being sought from the Court, and stipulated to dismiss the claims with prejudice. The Court entered judgment for Plaintiffs in part and for the Government in part.

Plaintiffs, represented by private and public interest counsel including the ACLU, sought certification of a class of all persons who had been or would be detained in ICE facilities; who had been or would be determined to have a credible fear of persecution in their home countries; and who were eligible for release, but had been denied such release pursuant to ICE's blanket \"No-Release Policy.\"\n\nIn addition to class certification, plaintiffs asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the No-Release Policy violated the APA (as arbitrary and capricious), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (by denying plaintiffs individualized custody determinations, instead basing such determinations on a policy of deterring future immigration). Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction the same day they filed their complaint.\n\nOn Feb. 20, 2015, the District Court (Judge James E. Boasberg) granted plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification, and denied defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court found that, although an across-the-board ICE policy aimed at denying all release to asylum-seeking Central American families did not exist, there was \"ample support in the record\" to find that DHS required ICE officers \"to consider deterrence of mass migration as a factor in custody determinations, and that this policy has played a significant role in the recent increased detention of Central American mothers and children.\" The Court also found that this policy \"contributed to the near universal detention of Central American families since June 2014.\" The Court held that plaintiffs had standing to challenge this policy, as they satisfied the requirements for class certification under the relation back doctrine.\n\nIn ruling on the merits of a preliminary injunction, the Court held that plaintiffs had a significant likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their claim, and stated that DHS's approach to detention did not comport with \"traditional purposes\" and was \"poorly substantiated.\" The Court also held that plaintiffs were likely to face irreparable harm without injunctive relief; the public interest would be served by an injunction; and the government could not be harmed by an injunction ending an unlawful practice. <i>R.I.L-R v.

However, despite this policy change, the government maintained that the Court lacked jurisdiction over the case and that the challenged policy had been lawful.\n\nAfter conferring with the parties, on June 29, 2015, Judge Boasberg dissolved the preliminary injunction (except for the provisional class certification) and administratively closed the case. Judge Boasberg specified that if defendants wish to reinstate a policy of considering deterrence, they must notify the Court. If this happens, plaintiffs may move to administratively reopen the case and request a reinstatement of the preliminary injunction. As of February 20, 2021, the case remained administratively closed and there was no further activity in the case. Still, the district court’s order requiring the government to inform plaintiffs if it resumes its practice of detaining families on deterrence grounds remains in effect.\n", "summary": "On Jan. 6, 2015, Central American immigrant mothers and children filed a class action lawsuit against DHS and ICE, challenging their \"No-Release Policy\" in making custody determinations for asylum-seeking families.

{"document": "On November 20, 2018, a group of asylum seekers challenged the federal government’s latest asylum policy, which prohibited people who enter the United States along the southern border somewhere other than a designated port of entry from obtaining asylum. Specifically, the plaintiffs challenged an interim final rule promulgated on November 9, 2018, declaring all those subject to a presidential proclamation concerning the southern border ineligible for asylum, as well as the “Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States” signed the same day blocking the entry of all people entering the United States without inspection at the southern border. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Represented by the National Immigrant Justice Center, Human Rights First, and private counsel, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and assigned to Magistrate Judge Randolph D. Moss.\n\nThe plaintiffs were six non-citizens who entered the United States seeking asylum. Two were a father and daughter who fled Honduras to escape a gang threatening to kill them, fearing the local police would not be willing to protect them. Another fled from Mexico, seeking safety from her gang-affiliated partner who repeatedly beat her and threatened to kill her. A fourth plaintiff was an unaccompanied minor from Honduras who sought to escape a credible fear of murder from his father—a police officer who abused him—and from a gang that the plaintiff refused to join on moral grounds. Another two plaintiffs were a mother and her son from Honduras seeking asylum to escape the violence and threat of death posed by her husband. None had been granted asylum. \n\nThe plaintiffs argued that federal law allowed non-citizens to seek asylum regardless of their immigration status or how they entered the United States. Further, federal law established procedural safeguards that aimed to give asylum seekers a fair review process during removal proceedings. The plaintiffs also argued that under treaty obligations, the United States could not deny asylum on the basis of where the non-citizen entered the country. But the government’s new rule, part of its broader “zero-tolerance” policy on immigration, “shutters access to the asylum system for thousands of men, women, and children that the Administration concedes are likely to have meritorious asylum claims.” Faced with even longer wait times at the border, the complaint argued, asylum seekers already in dangerous situations and with scarce financial resources were thus left seriously vulnerable to violence from criminal organizations near the border.\n\nAt the same time the complaint was filed, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, to be followed by a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation and enforcement of the rule and the proclamation. \n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs, as did a group of seven United States Senators.\n\nOn December 17, 2018, the court held a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and consolidated the case with <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17043\">S.M.S.R. v.

The court held that the rule challenged by the plaintiffs was “unlawful” within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. The court also found both the plaintiffs’ argument for an injunction and the defendants’ argument against the injunction unpersuasive; as a practical matter, it would be impossible to vacate the challenged rule with respect to the organizational plaintiffs without vacating the entire rule. As such, the court agreed to vacate the rule but declined the plaintiffs’ request to enforce the requested injunction.

Represented by the Transgender Law Center and the Rapid Defense Network, along with private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States. They requested an injunction ordering supervised release of all transgender people in immigration detention. The plaintiffs argued that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not provide sufficient measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in its facilities and that transgender individuals are particularly vulnerable to infection because they are more likely to have underlying health conditions like HIV, diabetes, and high blood pressure. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that by subjecting them to a higher risk of infection, the defendants failed to ensure their safety and health and held them in conditions amounting to punishment in violation of their substantive due process rights.

United States Department of Homeland Security</i></a> challenges the Department of Homeland Security’s consideration and adjudication of applications following certification of honorable military service. \n</i>\n<hr>\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act provides an expedited path to citizenship for non-citizens serving in the United States military, but in 2016, the Obama Department of Defense implemented a new internal policy adding substantive and procedural requirements. Objecting to new policy, three non-citizen service members, represented by private counsel, filed this class-action lawsuit against the Department of Defense. The complaint, filed on September 1, 2017 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and assigned to Judge Ellen S. Huvelle, alleged that the Department’s policy violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Department’s new requirements were unlawful; an injunction barring the Department from implementing the 2016 policy; and mandamus and APA relief compelling the Department to promptly process naturalization paperwork without adding extra-statutory requirements. They also sought to bar the Department from retaliation against soldiers participating in the lawsuit, and from discharging a soldier in order to avoid certifying her honorable service. Finally, they sought attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs had all joined the military through the MAVNI program (“Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest”), through which the Department of Defense enlisted non-citizen soldiers who had special medical or linguistic skills needed by the military. Under this program, which was authorized by 8 U.S.C. §1440, MAVNI soldiers qualified for an expedited pathway to U.S. citizenship; the Department even contractually required MAVNI soldiers to apply for citizenship. This opportunity was a significant recruiting incentive. \n\nAs part of the expedited naturalization process, the Department of Defense was required to certify to the Department of Homeland Security that an applicant’s military service had been honorable; DHS created Form N-426 for this certification. The statute did not specify a particular duration of service; it simply required a soldier’s service to be honorable. DHS regulations confirmed that a soldier could be eligible for expedited naturalization after one day of military service.\n\nContrary to the express language of the statute, the 2016 policy indicated that the Department would not certify a soldier’s honorable service unless she had served in active-duty status. The policy also restricted the pool of military officials authorized to sign the certification.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ certification requests had been denied or delayed because of the new policy. They alleged that the delay in naturalization deprived them of the protections that the statute was intended to provide, including access to United States consular services while deployed overseas, work and school authorization and benefits, and ability to sponsor family members.\n\nOn October 25, 2017, the court granted a preliminary injunction, requiring that the Department “use its best efforts” to complete each N-426 form within 2 days of receiving it. 285 F. Supp. 3d 21. The order provisionally certified a class for purposes of the preliminary injunction, comprising MAVNI recruits who had enlisted prior to October 13, 2017. Two days later, the Department sought an administrative stay of one week, to allow time for the Solicitor General to decide whether to appeal the order; the court denied that motion the same day. The court’s order clarified that any application which had previously been returned to its applicant would have to be re-submitted in order to be certified.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 3, 2017. On November 15, they moved to enforce the preliminary injunction, alleging that the Department was not complying with the court’s order: it was not promptly completing N-426 forms, it had “imposed new administrative pre-conditions for issuance of N-426 forms,” and it had not informed unit commanders or class members of the requirements of the preliminary injunction.\n\nThe same week, the Department moved for dismissal or for summary judgment. Acknowledging that the court had already granted class certification in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17688&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseType%7CIM%3BcaseState%7CDC%3BcaseNum%7C0080%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B\"><i>Nio</i></a>, the Department did not oppose the plaintiffs’ class certification motion in this case. It did, however, seek to limit the class to include only those who qualified as of the date of class certification. When the court granted certification on December 1, 2017, it specified no cut-off date for class membership; it simply specified MAVNI soldiers who had not received a duly authenticated N-426.\n\nOn December 15, 2017, the court ordered the Department to submit regular status reports. (This order was eventually vacated in June 2020.)\n\nOn January 11, 2018, the court dismissed the plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim, but denied the Department’s motion to dismiss (or grant summary judgment on) the remainder of the plaintiffs’ claims. 285 F. Supp. 3d 257. On May 23, the court denied the Department’s motion to reconsider. 315 F. Supp. 3d 266.

United States Department of Defense</i></a> is a similar challenge by non-MAVNI soldiers.</i><hr>The Immigration and Nationality Act provides an expedited path to citizenship for foreign nationals serving in the United States military. However, in 2017, the Department of Homeland Security began (at the request of the Department of Defense) to delay soldiers’ citizenship applications until the Department of Defense could complete an additional background check. Objecting to this new policy, 10 non-citizen service members, represented by private counsel, filed this class-action lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Department of Defense. The complaint, filed May 24, 2017 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and assigned to Judge Ellen S. Huvelle, alleged that the Department of Homeland Security’s policy was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. \n\nThe plaintiffs had all joined the military through the MAVNI program (“Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest”), through which the Department of Defense enlisted non-citizen soldiers who had special medical or linguistic skills needed by the military. Under this program, which was authorized by 8 U.S.C. §1440, MAVNI soldiers qualified for an expedited pathway to U.S. citizenship; the military even contractually required MAVNI soldiers to apply for citizenship. This opportunity was a significant recruiting incentive.\n\nWhen a soldier applied for expedited naturalization, the Department of Defense was required by law to certify the soldier’s honorable military service (using DHS Form N-426), after which the Department of Homeland Security would process the soldier’s naturalization application. The plaintiffs in this case had already received certification of their honorable military service; however, after issuing certification, the Department of Defense asked the Department of Homeland Security to delay the soldiers’ applications while it conducted further background checks and investigations.\n\nWhen the Department of Homeland Security complied with this request, the resulting delay deprived the plaintiffs of the protections of citizenship that the statute was intended to provide for service members. The plaintiffs claimed that Congress had enacted the statute to make the naturalization process easier for soldiers, not harder, and that this enhanced background investigation process was directly contrary to congressional intent.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a declaration that it was not lawful for the agencies to put applications on hold to conduct background checks. They sought an injunction compelling the Department of Homeland Security to promptly process applications (and to expedite applications which had already been delayed); barring the Department of Defense from further interference with the processing of applications; and prohibiting either agency from retaliating against the plaintiffs or members of the proposed class. They sought similar mandamus and Administrative Procedure Act relief. Finally, they sought attorneys’ fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August 4, 2017. On August 24, the court ordered the agencies to begin submitting weekly status reports.\n\nOn September 6, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. Although they had demonstrated that the processing delay was causing them irreparable harm, they had failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits. Further, the plaintiffs’ irreparable harm did not outweigh the seriousness of the national security concerns presented by the agencies. 270 F. Supp. 3d 49.\n\nOn October 13, 2017, the Department of Defense <a href=\"https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/Naturalization-Honorable-Service-Certification.pdf\"> further announced</a> that it would “recall and de-certify” its honorable service certifications for service members who had not yet completed a background check. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, objecting to this additional obstacle in the naturalization process.\n\nThe court granted class certification on October 27, 2017. 323 F.R.D. 28. The class consisted of MAVNI soldiers who had enlisted prior to October 13, 2017; had received an N-426 certifying their honorable service; and whose naturalization had been delayed or withheld because of the agencies’ new policies. The same day, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, “for the reasons set forth in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-DC-0079-0003.pdf\">Court’s opinion granting a preliminary injunction in <i>Kirwa</i></a>” (issued two days earlier). The injunction prevented the Department of Defense from recalling or de-certifying a soldier’s Form N-426 while awaiting the results of a background investigation.\n\nOn January 23, 2018, the court denied the agencies’ motion to dismiss. In an April 12, 2018 order, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for more extensive preliminary injunctive relief. The agencies were ordered to submit reports to the court every four weeks, and the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Robin M. Meriweather for further proceedings.\n\nOn June 20, 2018, the court denied another motion by the agencies for dismissal or for summary judgment. On July 16, 2018, the magistrate judge ordered the agencies to provide a redacted version of a confidential agency document that the plaintiffs sought in discovery. 314 F. Supp. 3d 238.\n\nA year later, on May 22, 2019, the court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs. Because the Department of Homeland Security’s “purported reasons” for delaying applications “[did] not comport with the evidence before the Court,” the court concluded that the policy of delay was “arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.” The court therefore vacated the MSSD portion of the delay policy (the MSSD was one of the key components of the background investigation). 385 F. Supp. 3d 44.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This putative class action case challenges the government’s use of an emergency public health order issued under 42 U.S.C. § 265 to restrict immigration of unaccompanied minors.  Pursuant to the emergency public order, the government has expelled unaccompanied children without following usual immigration laws, saying the children could spread COVID-19 if the children were processed and detained under regular immigration laws. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the order, as well as class certification and a preliminary injunction. On November 18, the court granted the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction and certified the class. The defendants appealed on November 25 and moved to stay the case pending appeal, which the D.C. Circuit granted. The case and appeal remain ongoing. <hr>\n\n<b><u>Immigration Safeguards For Unaccompanied Children</b></u>\nPreviously, unaccompanied children arriving at the border seeking safety were awarded protection under two laws. First, provisions in the Homeland Security Act vest care for unaccompanied children with the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), giving the minors access to legal care and housing.  Second, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) requires that minors must be transferred to ORR custody within 72 hours following apprehension, and removal of a child requires a decision by an immigration judge. Separately, statutes affirming internationally agreed upon protections permit unaccompanied children to seek shelter in the United States by claiming asylum, withholding of removal, and protection from torture.  Furthermore, immigration laws recognize the possibility that immigrants arrive at the border with a communicable disease, however these statutes do not permit deportation without screening for persecution or torture. \n\n<b><u>CDC Issues Emergency Public Health Order (Title 42 Process)</b></u>\nOn March 20, 2020, the President announced that public health provision of Title 42 of the U.S. Code would be used to suspend entry of all individuals at the border who lack proper documentation. Simultaneously, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a regulation without notice and comment. Specifically invoking language contained in Section 265, the government claimed that the Surgeon General may prohibit introduction of persons that pose serious danger to the United States because of the presence of a communicable disease in their country of origin. Pursuant to the regulation, the CDC issued an order that other agencies may immediately suspend the introduction of these immigrants because of the danger they pose to Border Patrol personnel at ports of entry. The order gives the Department of Homeland Security discretion to allow exceptions based on the totality of the circumstances, and it remains silent on application for individuals seeking asylum, withholding of removal, Convention Against Torture (CAT) protection, and circumstances for unaccompanied children. In the complaint, this regulation and subsequent order is referred to as the Title 42 Process. \n\n<b><u>The Plaintiff’s Apprehension Under the Title 42 Process and Subsequent Lawsuit</b></u>\nOn August 11, 2020, border patrol agents apprehended the plaintiff, a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor fleeing persecution in Guatemala. Immediately, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) placed him into custody awaiting deportation pursuant to the Title 42 Process. Additionally, even with the presence of a relative in the United States and vacancy in an ORR facility, the plaintiff – exhibiting no COVID-19 symptoms – remained in CBP custody.\n\nIn response to this treatment by the Border Patrol, on August 14, 2020, the plaintiff, represented by the ACLU, sued the leaders of numerous governmental departments, including the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the Centers for Disease and Control, and officials leading CPB, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the Administrative Procedure Act for unlawful agency action and arbitrary and capricious enforcement. The plaintiff alleged that the Title 42 Process violates the requirements of the TVPRA, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Public Health Service Act. The plaintiff requested the court certify the class as “[a]ll unaccompanied noncitizen children who (1) are or will be detained in U.S. government custody in the United States, and (2) are or will be subjected to the Title 42 Process.” In addition, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the new Title 42 Process as applied to the plaintiff and class members, as well as attorney’s fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a motion for classwide preliminary injunction on August 20th, asking the court to cease the application of the Title 42 Process to plaintiff and class members. The International Refugee Assistance Project filed an Amicus Brief in support of the plaintiff’s motion. On September 6, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey for the preparation of a report and recommendation on both the motions for a preliminary injunction and class certification. \n\nOn September 25, Magistrate Judge Harvey recommended that Judge Sullivan grant the class certification and the preliminary injunction. 2020 WL 5793305. He found that the plaintiff was likely to succeed on his claim that the Regulation and Order exceeded the authority granted by the Public Health Service Act because the Act does not authorize the government to expel the plaintiff or putative class members from the US outside of the removal process of the Immigration and Nationality Act and other safeguards in Title 8 of the U.S. Code, including protections provided in the TVPRA. \n\nOn November 18, Judge Sullivan adopted Magistrate Judge Harvey's recommendations and granted the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction and provisionally granted the motion to certify class. 2020 WL 6770508. The order declared that the removal of the plaintiff without due process exceeded the authority that public health emergency decrees usually confer. Judge Harvey noted that another court in the D.C. District Court examined the Title 42 Process in a case with similar facts also granted a preliminary injunction based on likelihood of success on the merits. For more information, see <a href=\"https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17601\"><i>J.B.B.C. v. Wolf</i></a>. \n\nOn November 25, the defendants appealed the order to the D.C. Circuit, which was assigned USCA Case Number 20-5357. The defendants also filed a motion to stay pending appeal on December 3.\n\nBack in the district court, the defendants moved for reconsideration of the November 18 order, which the court denied on December 3. The defendants contended that, given the strain on the strain on the healthcare systems along the southern border and increased number of unaccompanied minors covered by the CDC Order, prohibiting the expulsion of class members deprived the government of an \"important tool\" to help address the public health emergency, increased the risk of transmitting COVID-19 into the United States, and further strained the country's limited healthcare resources. The court ruled that the government did not meet its its burden of showing that the circumstances justified a stay pending appeal.\n\nIn response to the defendants' notices to the court regarding their compliance with the preliminary injunction, on January 22, the court ordered the parties to submit joint status reports addressing the defendants' compliance and, more specifically, updating the court on the situation regarding thirty-two minors who were returned to Guatemala in violation of the injunction. \n\nOn January 29, the D.C. Circuit granted the defendants' motion to stay. On March 1, the defendants filed a joint motion to suspend the briefing schedule, which the Circuit Court granted the following day. \n\nIn the District Court, the defendants filed multiple joint motions to hold the case in abeyance, which the court granted. A joint status report is due on April 22, 2021.\n\nThe case remains ongoing.", "summary": "In August 2020, a persecuted minor seeking asylum in the United States who was instead detained filed this class action complaint in the D.C.

On November 18, the court granted the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction and certified the class. The defendants appealed on November 25 and moved to stay the case pending appeal.

{"document": "On December 21, 2020, Human Rights First, a nonprofit human rights organization, brought this lawsuit against then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf and others in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of refugees seeking to enter the United States for asylum. Plaintiffs challenged a new rule promulgated by the Department of Homeland Security that sought to change applicants' eligibility for asylum. The new rule would have restricted who qualified as a refugee, which refugees were able to seek asylum, and how likely a given applicant could succeed in their claim. Represented by Williams and Connolly in D.C., plaintiffs alleged that the rule changes amounted to overturning legal precedent as well as being counter to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Refugee Act, and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Specifically, plaintiffs argued that the Department of Homeland Security acted contrary to existing legal authority, in excess of the Department’s given authority, in a manner inconsistent with how procedural rulemaking ought to occur, and without comprehensive consideration of the interests involved. Plaintiffs further argued that the rules were enacted by Wolf when the latter was without proper authority as the Acting Secretary. Plaintiffs thus sought declaratory and injunctive relief pertaining to their claims and to strike down the rules as well as attorneys’ fees. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan was assigned to the case.\n\nOn December 22, 2020, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. However, as a result of a nationwide preliminary injunction granted in the cases <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18018\">Pangea Legal Services v.

{"document": "On May 25, 2011, three foreign residents of Indiana filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division, against the cities of Indianapolis and Franklin and the counties of Marion and Johnson. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Indiana, the national ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, the National Immigration Law Center, and private counsel, filed their suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq., and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, claiming that Indiana's Senate Enrolled Act 590 (SEA 590) violated the federal Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Section 19, which allowed local law enforcement officers to make warrantless arrests of people who were subject to a removal order issued by an immigration court or a detainer or notice of action issued by the Department of Homeland Security, or who had been indicted or convicted of an aggravated felony, was preempted by federal law and constituted an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment and a violation of due process under the Fourteenth. They also claimed that Section 18, which made the use of consular identification cards for identification within the state a civil infraction punishable by fine, was preempted by federal law and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that SEA 590 violated the Constitution and a peremptory injunction barring its enforcement before it came into effect on July 1, 2011.\n\nOn June 13, 2011, Mexico moved for leave to file an amicus on behalf of plaintiffs, and Brazil, Guatemala, El Salvador and Columbia moved to join it.

The court certified both classes and appointed counsel for them.\n\nOn October 11, 2011, the county defendants filed a motion to join the United States as a necessary party.

Represented by Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, the plaintiff is Iranian-born and lives in Switzerland; she was traveling to Boston to commence work at Brigham & Woman's hospital as a researcher and expert on state-of-the-art genetic sequencing technologies focusing on pediatric susceptibility to infection.\n\nThe complaint alleged that on Jan. 28, 2017, a gate operator at the Frankfurt airport, who introduced himself as a representative from the consulate of the United States, told the plaintiff that she was ineligible to board a flight to the United States pursuant to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on Jan. 27, 2017 (suspending entry into the United States of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen). The complaint further alleged that when the plaintiff returned to the Frankfort airport on Jan. 31, with a copy of the Jan. 29 Temporary Restraining Order issued in <i>Louhghalem/Tootkaboni v.

{"document": "This is a case about President Trump’s July 21, 2020 memorandum titled “Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census” to the Secretary of Commerce. This memo instructed the 2020 Census to exclude undocumented immigrants from the population data created for the purposes of congressional apportionment. Many felt this action was taken to deter participation by immigrant communities and communities of color in the 2020 Census, which would in turn deprive these communities of the political representation and federal financial resources to which they are entitled, and filed suit as a result.\n\nIn response to the memo, Haitian-Americans United, Inc., Brazilian Worker Center, Chelsea Collaborative, Inc. and Centro Presente—all non-profits serving immigrants of color across Massachusetts—filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District Of Massachusetts on July 27, 2020. The plaintiffs sued President Trump, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Director of the U.S. Census Bureau Steven Dillingham, and Secretary of the Department of Commerce Wilbur Ross under the Administrative Procedure Act and 42 U.S.C. § 1985. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the memo violated Article I, Section 2 of Constitution which specifies that congressional apportionment must be based on a total count of all persons because excluding undocumented residents will not result in the required of an \"actual enumermation\" of all persons and will chill immigrant participation in the 2020 census. The plaintiffs also alleged that the memo violated the right to equal protection as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment becuase the memo \"is motivated by racial animus towards immigrants of color, non-US citizens, foreign-born individuals, and undocumented individuals. The plaintiffs further argued that the President and the Secretary of Commerce have conspired to violate immigrants' and non-citizens' right to equal protection. Represented by Lawyers for Civil Rights, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief that the memo was unconstitutional and that any compliance with the memo's instructions to the Census Bureau to produce tabulations of population data excluding undocumented residents for congressional apportionment violated the Administrative Procedure Act, and injunctive relief preventing the defendants from providing information to the President that would permit him to exclude undocumented immigrants from the congressional apportionment base.

{"document": "On Jan. 24, 2018, the NAACP filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Represented by its own counsel, the NAACP challenged DHS's Nov. 2017 revocation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians living in the United States. The plaintiff alleged that DHS violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fifth Amendment by relying on stereotypes based on race and national origin to deprive Haitians of their rights. The plaintiff sought mandamus (for DHS to carry out the Immigration and Nationality Act's procedures for reviewing TPS) and a declaratory judgment. The case was assigned to Judge Marvin J. Garbis. \n\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Secretary of DHS may find that a country's conditions temporarily prevent its nationals from safely returning, or that the country is unable to adequately handle the return of nationals. In such a situation, the Secretary may grant TPS to these nationals for 6 to 18 months, with a possible extension following a review of country conditions. TPS allows recipients to remain and work legally in the United States.\n\nDHS had initiated TPS for Haitians following the Jan. 2010 earthquake in Haiti. After each 18-month period since then, DHS had reviewed the program, determined that Haitian nationals could not yet return safely (due to severe safety, health, housing, and infrastructure problems, exacerbated by subsequent hurricanes), and extended the program.\n\nThis policy, however, ended with DHS' termination of TPS for Haitians in Nov. 2017. The NAACP argued that DHS' decision to end the program was not based on a change in conditions in Haiti, but rather on racially discriminatory stereotypes of Haitians. These stereotypes allegedly appeared in President Trump's remarks that the plaintiffs claimed disparaged Haitians, and DHS' alleged search for evidence of Haitians' criminality and welfare dependence.\n\nOn Apr. 17, the NAACP filed an amended complaint, adding two other organizational plaintiffs that advocate for Haitians living in the U.S.\n\nOn May 7, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and lack of jurisdiction. The defendants argued that Congress had statutorily precluded judicial review of challenges to the Secretary's discretionary decisions regarding TPS designations. As to the plaintiffs' equal protection claims, the defendants argued that the rational basis standard of review applied and that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the Secretary's decision was not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. \n\nThe case was reassigned to Judge Deborah K. Chasanow on July 24, 2018.\n\nOn March 12, 2019, Judge Chasanow filed an opinion and order granting in part and denying in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. First, Judge Chasanow found that the court did have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' constitutional claims. Next, she held that the plaintiffs had alleged a plausible claim for relief. Instead of rational basis review, Judge Chasanow found that the proper question was whether the government's decision to terminate TPS was motivated by impermissible race or national origin discrimination; if so, the action would be presumptively invalid and only upheld if it were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government purpose. Consequently, Judge Chasanow held that it was appropriate to view any circumstantial evidence to find proof of discriminatory motive, and that the plaintiffs had provided such evidence, which was to be viewed in their favor at this stage. Judge Chasanow then dismissed the plaintiffs' claims for mandamus and declaratory relief, as their constitutional claim would provide them with full relief. 364 F.Supp.3d 568. \n\nOn April 8, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to stay or, in the alternative, to confine discovery to the administrative record.

Nielsen</i> (located <a href=\"https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16815\">here</a> in this Clearinghouse). \n\nIn an April 26 order, Judge Chasanow informed the parties that if they could reach an agreement, discovery could be limited to what had already been produced by the government in other, parallel litigation.\n\nOn March 23, 2020, Judge Chasanow granted the defendants' motion to stay. Due to the interconnected nature of the parallel litigation, particularly related to the scope of permissible discovery, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Judge Chasanow concluded it was best to stay proceedings in this case while the other cases were litigated. \n\nThis case is ongoing.", "summary": "On Jan. 24, 2018, the NAACP sued the DHS over its Nov. 2017 revocation of Temporary Protected Status (first implemented after the Jan. 2010 Haitian earthquake) for Haitians living in the United States.

The Fourth Circuit dismissed these appeals on September 30, 2020. \n\nBack in the District Court on September 18, 2020, Judge Chuang granted in part and denied in part the June 19 motion for class certification. The court approved two subclasses: (1) the \"Howard County Subclass\" defined as \"All persons who are or will in the future be in ICE detention at the Howard County Detention Center who are age 50 or older or who have medical conditions that place them at heightened risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19;\" and (2), a \"Worcester County Subclass\" defined as \"All persons who are or will in the future be in ICE detention at the Worcester County Detention Center who are age 50 or older or who have medical conditions that place them at heightened risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19.\" However, the court denied the petitioner's request that the court hold expedited bail hearings for class members. The court reasoned that due to the reduced numbers of ICE detainees in the Detention Facilities, improved mitigation measures, and test results showing no cases among ICE detainees and limited numbers of positive tests among staff, it couldn't find that exceptional circumstances required bail hearings as the only way to protect the petitioners' health and safety. 2020 WL 5593338.\n\nIn light of a growing number of positive tests, the petitioners renewed their motion for expedited bail hearings, asserting unconstitutional conditions of confinement. They argued that respondents' efforts to address COVID-19 failed to protect the petitioners from a known threat to their health and safety and that the plaintiffs' confinement was impermissible because they are civil detainees, not convicted criminal prisoners. \n\nJudge Chuang denied the plaintiffs' motion on January 26, 2021. The court determined that the petitioners did not have a high probability of success in establishing that the respondents acted with deliberate indifference to the health and safety of the plaintiffs. The court found that HCDC's recent measures to combat COVID-19 spread, including increased testing, the distribution of N-95 masks, and the offering of vaccination to all detainees, constituted a reasonable response to the detainees' health concerns. The court also found that the respondents' offer of vaccinations undermined the claim of impermissible punishment. The court concluded that the petitioners failed to identify any specific exceptional circumstances warranting bail determinations for all high-risk ICE detainees. 2021 WL 252718\n\nThe case is ongoing. ", "summary": "This is a habeas action seeking the release of immigration detainees housed in ICE facilities in Maryland. The court initially denied the detainees' TRO, but eventually granted two preliminary injunctions that ordered the release of several detainees from their respective detention centers. The court also granted the petitioners' motion for class certification."}
{"document": "This lawsuit was filed in state court in March 2007 by a landlord in Valley Park, Missouri, to challenge the City's anti-immigration ordinances, which reached both housing and employment issues.  The plaintiff was one of several parties to an earlier case, in which the court had ruled prior versions of the ordinances unlawful under state law.  Reynolds v. City of Valley Park, IM-MO-1.   The City then passed amended versions, which are the subject of this lawsuit, and also of a new iteration of the Reynolds case (\"Reynolds II\").  In Reynolds II, the plaintiffs won a temporary restraining order in April, which was then continued by consent of the parties until final resolution.  See IM-MO-1 for more details on the ordinances and both Reynolds litigations. \n\nThe plaintiff in this case filed a petition for a preliminary injunction, and the case was then removed by defendants to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, before Judge E. Richard Webber.  \n\nIn July 2007, the City repealed the immigration-related components of the housing ordinance.  Accordingly, on August 9, 2007, the parties in this case agreed to dismiss the housing-related causes of action.  The employment matters remained in issue; the plaintiffs argued that the employment ordinance was inoperative, because its enacting language stated that it came into effect only on the end of the injunction in Reynolds v. Valley Park, and that injunction had become permanent.  After the filing of the dismissal, the City enacted legislation which made the employment ordinance effective immediately.  Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a declaration that the employment ordinance was invalid and unenforceable and moved to amend their complaint.  Both parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nOn October 5, 2007, Judge Webber issued an order granting plaintiffs leave to take nine additional discovery depositions.  Plaintiff's request to depose the City Attorney was, however, denied.  The depositions were completed on October 19, 2007, and the parties supplemented their summary judgment briefs to address the additional factual information gleamed from the depositions.\n\nOn January 31, 2008, Judge Webber issued his Memorandum and Order in which he held that the Ordinance at issue was not preempted by federal law, nor did plaintiffs prove that  the Ordinance violated equal protection, due process or Missouri state law.  Accordingly, the Court denied plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief and entered judgment in favor of the City.\n\nFollowing plaintiff's appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, affirmed the lower court's order on June 5, 2009.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a habeas action brought by seven medically vulnerable detainees in Mississippi. They sought release from detention because their underlying medical conditions made them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, which they alleged made their detention unconstitutional. The court denied a temporary restraining order on June 3, 2020.<hr> On April 16, 2020, seven medically vulnerable civil immigration detainees held in the Adams County Detention Center brought this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers' Guild, and the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law, the plaintiffs sued Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the New Orleans ICE field office and the warden of the Adams County Detention Center under the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 701) and the federal habeas statute (28 U.S.C. § 2241). The plaintiffs alleged that the risks from COVID-19 rendered their continued detention unsafe and that the government did not have sufficiently compelling reasons to keep them detained, violating the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment. They sought habeas, declaratory, and injunctive relief. \n\nAt the same time, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), arguing that their detention was unconstitutional and that release from detention was the only action that could remedy the violation of their rights. The defendants filed a motion in opposition to the TRO on April 30. \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge David C. Bramlette III and Magistrate Judge Michael T. Parker. \n\nAfter a hearing, Judge Bramlette denied the TRO on June 3, 2020. While Judge Bramlette determined that habeas relief was available to detainees challenging conditions of confinement who requested release, he found that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits because (1) the government's interest in ensuring that detainees did not abscond justified continued detention; and (2) the defendants were taking steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the detention center. So, Judge Bramlette concluded that the defendants were likely neither punishing detainees nor deliberately indifferent to their medical needs. 2020 WL 2949779.\n\nTwo months passed without further substantive docket activity.

{"document": "On October 7, 2013, a group of Latino men and the Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance (MIJA) filed this putative class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana. Plaintiffs sued the Montana Highway Patrol (MHP) and Montana Department of Justice under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, claimed violations of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments' prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures; and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.). Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as attorney’s fees.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class status to represent “[a]ll Latino persons who, since October 7, 2010, have been or will be in the future, stopped, detained, questioned or searched by Montana Highway Patrol officers while driving or sitting in a vehicle on a public roadway or parking area in the State of Montana.”\n\nPlaintiffs alleged that Defendants had a pattern and practice of seizing Latino residents and visitors of Montana and “prolonging their detention” for the sole purpose of contacting the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) based on suspicions of immigration status violations, which was not within the authority of MHP. Plaintiffs alleged MHP used racial profiling to form their suspicions regarding immigration status and used deceptive practices to detain Latino residents and visitors.\n\nSpecifically, one of the named plaintiffs in this case alleged he was pulled over for a speeding violation, then asked repeated questions regarding his citizenship and whether he was in the country legally. He was a U.S. citizen, but was subjected to prolonged detention during which members of the MHP contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), even after production of a valid Montana driver’s license. A second named plaintiff alleged he was asked to produce identification as the passenger of a vehicle. He and the driver were detained for two hours while DHS was contacted to inquire about their immigration status; no traffic violation or any other citation was issued for this stop.\n\nOn December 3, 2013, Judge Sam E. Haddon recused himself from the case. The case was reassigned to Judge Dana L. Christensen.\n\nOn December 6, 2013, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. They argued that the state law claims were barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity; that Title VI did not apply to individuals, yet plaintiffs were suing individuals; and that plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claims were “doubled up” with the equal protection claims. Based on an April 1, 2014 report issued by Magistrate Judge Carolyn S. Otsby, on July 25, 2014, Judge Christensen dismissed the state law claims but denied the motion to dismiss the Title VI and Fourth Amendment claims.\n\nThe parties proceeded to discovery, but on April 3, 2015, Judge Christensen approved a settlement agreement. Under the terms of the settlement, MHP would adhere to its policy GR-9, which stated that Highway Patrol officers cannot detain individuals <i>solely</i> for the purpose of verifying immigration status or stop individuals on the basis of race or national origin, among other descriptors. The settlement further provided for training for MHP officers on this policy and also began requiring officers to log when and if they contacted DHS during the course of a traffic stop. In addition, the defendants agreed to pay for racial profiling studies done by an independent authority over a five year period; to post annual reports regarding racial profiling and steps taken to address it on the Montana Department of Justice website; and to establish an Independent Police Auditor to review investigations of complaints. Finally, the consent decree stated that the defendants would pay the plaintiffs' attorneys fees, but there was no later order as to the exact amount. \n\nThe consent decree ended on April 3, 2020 without any motions for enforcement.\n", "summary": "A group of Latino men sued the Montana Highway Patrol after a series of traffic stops during which they alleged they were discriminated against and unlawfully detained for prolonged periods of time while their immigration status was checked.

{"document": "The Jama lawsuit is a companion case to the class action, Brown v. Esmor Correctional Services, Inc., No. 98-1282(DRD) [IM-NJ-0003] and Joaquin DaSilva v. Esmor Correctional Services Incorporated, et al., No. 96-3755(DRD), which were also pending in to U.S. District Court District of New Jersey. All three cases, Jama, Brown and DaSilva were filed on behalf of undocumented aliens who were detained at a facility that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (''INS'') maintained in Elizabeth, New Jersey pending a determination of their asylum status. Plaintiffs in all cases alleged that during their detention they were subjected to torture, beatings, harassment and inhumane living conditions which included inadequate sanitation, exercise, and medical treatment. Brown was a class action, while Jama and DaSilva were filed and maintained on behalf of individual plaintiffs that opted out of the Brown class. All three cases were assigned to District Court Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise.\n\nJama was filed on June 16, 1997 and named as defendants the INS, Esmor Correctional Services, Inc., the private corporation which operated the facility for the INS., and individual corporate officers and agents. Claims for relief included alleged violations of the First, Fifth, and Thirteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; numerous provisions of the New Jersey Constitution; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (''ICCPR''); customary international law; the Alien Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1350 (''ATCA''); the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb, et seq. (''RFRA''); the Fair Labor Standards Act; and New Jersey law. \n\nOn April 24, 1998 the District Court (Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise) certified the Brown case as a class action consisting of a class of all detainees who were incarcerated at the Elizabeth, New Jersey facility from August 1994 to July 1995. Notice was sent to class members in March 1999. Class members were given the option to opt out of the class and pursue their own damage actions. Many of the class notices mailed out were returned as undeliverable, as detainees had been released or transferred.\n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the Jama case as applied to various groups. The District Court, Judge Debevoise) granted the motion in part and denied it without prejudice in part. Jama v. U.S. I.N.S., 22 F.Supp.2d 353 (D.N.J. Oct 01, 1998).\n\nOn October 29, 1998, the Jama, Brown and DaSilva cases were consolidated for the purpose of discovery.\n\nExtensive discovery proceeded for four years. During that time, the parties also engaged in protracted litigation over whether plaintiffs in the Jama and DaSilva actions failed to timely opt-out of the Brown class action. See DaSilva v. Esmor Correctional Services Inc., 215 F.R.D. 477 (D.N.J. 2003); Jama v. Esmor Correctional Services, Inc., 2005 WL 2901899, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26060 (D.N.J. Nov 01, 2005); and Dasilva v. Esmor Correctional Services, Inc., 167 Fed.Appx. 303 (3rd Cir. 2006). The Jama plaintiffs eventually settled their claims against the U.S. and the INS, leaving Esmor and its officers as the lone defendants.\n\nIn January 2003, the Esmor defendants filed a motion for summary judgment in the Jama Action. A similar motion was filed in the Brown class action case in September 2003. Individual INS defendants also moved to dismiss or for summary judgment\n\nOral arguments on all the motions for summary judgment were conducted on June 29 and June 30, 2004. The District Court Debevoise, disposed of all pending motions in two separate orders. Jama v. INS, 334 F. Supp. 2d 662 (D.N.J. 2004) (addressing the Brown motions) and Jama v. U.S. I.N.S., 343 F.Supp.2d 338 (D.N.J. 2004) (addressing the Jama motions). Judge Debevoise held that the settlement agreement between plaintiffs and the U.S. settled any and all claims, that the INS was therefore entitled to be dismissed from the case. As to the Esmor defendants, Judge Debevoise ruled that plaintiffs had viable claims under 1) the Alien Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1350 (the \"ATCA\"); the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000 bb, et seq. (the \"RFRA\"); and state law claims based on Esmor's and its officers' alleged negligent failure to safeguard plaintiffs' property and negligent hiring, training, supervision and retention of employees. All other claims were dismissed.\n\nThe Court then deconsolidated the Brown case from the Jama and DaSilva actions, finding that the Brown case was ready for trial. The DaSilva case was eventually dismissed without prejudice and its plaintiffs became members of the Brown action class. The Brown case ultimately settled in August 2005, while the Jama action proceeded to trial. \n\nThe Jama proceedings were stayed briefly from November 2005 to February 2006, while the Courts resolved the objection that the Jama plaintiffs did not timely opt out of the Brown class action. See Jama v. Esmor Correctional Services, Inc., 2005 WL 2901899, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26060 (D.N.J. Nov 01, 2005) and Dasilva v. Esmor Correctional Services, Inc., 167 Fed.Appx. 303 (3rd Cir. 2006). After the stay was lifted, the parties completed discovery, including depositions of experts.\n\nPre-trial motions were filed and the Court was called upon to resolve disputes over expert witness testimony. Jama v. Esmor Correctional Services, Inc., 2007 WL 1847385, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45706 (D.N.J. Jun 25, 2007).\n\nA jury trial began on September 25, 2007 and continued through mid-November. On November 13, 2007, the jury reached a verdict, finding as follows:\n\n1. For defendants on the Alien Tort Claims Act claim and certain negligence claims.\n\n2. For plaintiff Jama on Religious Freedom Restoration Act claim and awarded $1.00 in nominal damages.\n\n3. For plaintiff Jama and against Esmor and several individual defendants on claim for negligent hiring, training, supervision and/or retention and awarded $100,000 in compensatory damages. \n\nNo punitive damages were rendered.\n\nOn November 20, 2007, the Court awarded plaintiffs attorneys' fees in the amount of $137,808.04 ($29,208.04 to Debevoise & Plimpton and $108,600.00 to the Rutgers Constitutional Litigation Clinic) in connection to a prior ruling concerning spoliation of evidence. Jama v. Esmor Corr. Servs., Inc., No. 97-3093(DRD), 2007 WL 4166016 (D.N.J. Nov. 20, 2007).\n\nOn March 17, 2008, the District Court (Judge Debevoise) entered an opinion denying Defendants' renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. The Court held that the trial record \"revealed a history of grievous abuses of the religious beliefs and practices not only of Jama but also of others, utterly without justification; and there is revealed a pattern of physical and emotional abuse of detainees, including Jama, perpetrated by untrained and often sadistic guards, all of which was known or should have been known by higher officers in Esmor.\" Jama v. Esmor Corr. Servs., Inc., No. 97-3093(DRD), 2008 WL 724337 (D.N.J. Mar. 17, 2008).\n\nOn April 16, 2008, Defendants filed a notice of appeal, seeking review of the Court's denial of their motions for judgment as a matter of law. This appeal would subsequently be voluntarily dismissed on October 2, 2008.\n\nOn April 23, 2008, the District Court awarded Plaintiffs attorneys' fees and expenses, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, in the amount of $642,398.57. Jama v. Esmor Corr. Servs., Inc., 549 F. Supp. 2d 602 (D.N.J. 2008). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit subsequently vacated the order, holding that the District Court's \"degree of success inquiry under § 1988 was based on an impermissible reconstruction of the jury verdict,\" and remanded for further proceedings. Jama v. Esmor Corr. Servs, Inc., 577 F.3d 169 (3d Cir. 2009). The parties subsequently reached a settlement agreement on the question of attorneys' fees (which was not filed with the Court).

Plaintiffs claimed that they were detained, interrogated and subjected to physical abuse, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The complaint sought damages and an injunction restraining ICE's New York Regional Office from executing unconstitutional raids.\n\nOn December 7, 2007, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim.  On July 30, 2008, the District Court (Judge John G. Koeltl) dismissed this motion as moot, because Plaintiffs had amended their complaint.  On December 21, 2009, Plaintiffs filed their fourth amended complaint, adding claims of Fifth Amendment violations (violations of Equal Protection due to the targeting of Latino communities); false imprisonment; reckless, negligent, and intentional infliction of emotional distress; trespass; assault and battery; and excessive force.  They sought equitable relief, damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and damages under <i>Bivens</i>.  After the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <i>Iqbal v. Ashcroft</i>, Defendants moved to dismiss the <i>Bivens</i> claim against the high-ranking official defendants on March 29, 2010.  And they moved to dismiss the claim for injunctive relief on May 19, 2010, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek such relief because they were unlikely to again be subjected to the allegedly unconstitutional behavior.\n\nOn December 22, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a petition to certify their class.  However, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <i>Dukes v. Walmart</i>, the District Court withdrew Plaintiffs' petition for class certification and granted leave to amend.  On November 22, 2011, Plaintiffs refiled their petition to certify their class.  On April 16, 2012, the District Court (Judge Katherine B.

However, on September 27, the District Court (Judge Forrest) adjourned all pending motions, presumably due to ongoing settlement negotiations.  On November 15, the court set a deadline of December 12 for the parties to submit a settlement or restore the action. This deadline was extended, after which the parties submitted a settlement agreement and voluntary dismissal on December 27. Judge Forrest signed the agreement on April 4, 2013.  The settlement agreement stipulated to a payment of one million dollars from ICE to Plaintiffs ($36,000 to each Plaintiff, remainder to attorneys), termination of Plaintiffs' immigration proceedings, implementation of a policy of training ICE officers on how to obtain proper consent for home (and curtilage) entrance, and a discontinuance of \"protective sweeps\" unless there is a reasonable, articulable suspicion of danger.  This agreement terminated the suit.\n\nDocument destruction as required by the settlement continued into 2015. There has been no docket activity since 2015.

{"document": "On May 18, 2010, two organizations comprised of day laborers and/or predominately Latino immigrant workers filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the First and Fourteenth Amendments against the Town of Oyster Bay. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and LatinoJustice PRLDEF, sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees and costs, claiming that the defendants, through the passage of an ordinance prohibiting the solicitation of labor from the town's streets and sidewalks, unlawfully prohibited speech related to employment and had a discriminatory animus against predominately Latino immigrant day laborers.  \n\nIn September 2009, the Town Board enacted the ordinance in question. It prohibited any person from standing on a street corner stopping or attempting to stop a passing car for employment-related purposes. It also prohibited drivers from stopping their cars for the same purposes.  The proposed purpose of the ordinance was to promote the health, safety, and welfare of motorists and pedestrians on the streets of the town.  However, the supervisor referenced the ordinance as a temporary solution to dealing with those who were not on the path to citizenship.  Comments from the public showed that town residents feared groups of men unfamiliar to them standing on the streets.  There was also proof of animosity towards immigrant day laborers, such as town residents saying the day laborers were unsightly, illegal, and not wanted in that town.  \n\nPlaintiffs argued that since New York laws already addressed health and safety concerns on the streets, this animus against predominantly Latino immigrant day laborers was what actually motivated the passing of the ordinance and that this violated the First Amendment right to free speech and Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. They also argued that the law was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  As a result of the ordinance, day laborers had suffered a significant loss of wages and harassment from police officers and people driving by them.  \n\nTwo days after the complaint was filed, on May 20, 2010, the District Court (Judge Denis Reagan Hurley) granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order preventing the town from enforcing the ordinance at issue. Then, on June 1, 2010, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance at issue, pending final resolution of the First Amendment claims. In response to this order, the defendants filed a notice of appeal with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on June 21, 2010. The case was argued in the Second Circuit under the docket number 10-2505-cv. Little docket activity occurred until May 17, 2011, when the Second Circuit (Judges Barrington D. Parker, Gerard E. Lynch, and Raymond J. Lohier, Jr.) affirmed the District Court's order converting the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction and remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings.  \n\nAfter a few months of discovery, on September 29, 2011, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The parties continued through the discovery process. On March 30, 2012, the District Court (Magistrate Judge Arlene Rosario Lindsay) granted the plaintiffs' motion for a protective order to withhold from discovery certain privileged documents: The identification documents and/or immigration status of the individual day laborers known to the plaintiffs.  The parties then continued to go through more discovery litigation.\n\nOn June 18, 2013, the District Court (Judge Hurley) affirmed Magistrate Judge Lindsay's protective order, allowing plaintiffs to withhold privileged documents in the discovery process.  Additionally, the District Court rejected the defendants' arguments that the plaintiffs lacked standing in this case, dismissing the defendants' motion for partial summary judgment. 954 F.Supp.2d 127.\n\nOn December 1, 2013, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment to permanently prevent the ordinance from ever taking effect, as it was unconstitutional. In the almost two-year interim, a similar court case, <i>Reed v. Town of Gilbert</i> was decided by the Supreme Court on June 18, 2015, which provided a rationale to dismiss this case as unconstitutional under the First Amendment and permanently enjoin the ordinance. On September 3, 2015, the District Court (Judge Hurley) cited this case as part of its rationale and issued a judgment that enjoined the ordinance permanently and declared the ordinance unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Because the District Court found that the ordinance did not withstand scrutiny under the First Amendment, it did not address the plaintiffs' due process or Equal Protection claims in its judgment. 128 F.Supp.3d 597.\n\nOn September 15, 2015, the defendants appealed the District Court's decision to enjoin the ordinance. The appeal continued in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals under the docket number 15-2914-cv. During this appeal, the defendants also argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring this case. On August 22, 2017, the Second Circuit (Judges Dennis Jacobs, Barrington D. Parker, and Jane A. Restani) affirmed the District Court's ruling enjoining the ordinance. The Second Circuit found that the District Court did not err in finding the ordinance unconstitutional under the First Amendment and that the plaintiffs indeed had standing to bring suit against the defendants.868 F.3d 104.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, the final stages of litigation began to determine how much defendants would pay to plaintiffs in attorney's fees and costs. In July of 2019, the Court ordered that defendants pay $1,505,806 to the plaintiffs' attorneys. On November 25th of that year, a satisfaction of the judgment was entered and the case was closed.", "summary": "On May 18, 2010, two organizations comprised of day laborers and/or predominately Latino immigrant workers filed a class action lawsuit in the Eastern District Court of New York under the First and Fourteenth Amendments against the Town of Oyster Bay.

After defeating the defendant's partial motion for summary judgment due to lack of standing, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was successful. On September 3, 2015, the District Court enjoined the ordinance and declared it unconstitutional as it violated the first amendment.

{"document": "On October 21, 2014, the American Immigration Council, National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, and American Civil Liberties Union filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the National Immigration Law Center, the American Immigration Council, the National Immigration Project/NLG and the ACLU Foundation Immigrants’ Rights Project sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants failed to disclose documents regarding information and practices in an Artesia, New Mexico immigration detention center.  Specifically, the defendants failed to disclose information concerning the expedited removal of families Artesia after 2014.\n\nThere had been growing concern about the policies, procedures and practices related to the implementation of the expedited removal process in Artesia, sparking major concern from the media and the public.  The facility in Artesia held women and minor children who had fled Central America, seeking refuge in the United States.  Many of these migrants fled persecution and extreme danger in their home countries, and sought asylum in the U.S.  However, some of these families have since been deported back to the countries from which they had fled, raising concern about the removal process.  The plaintiffs sought to examine the extent to which these women and children had valid claims of asylum and if these families were receiving the process required by law.  In order to understand this process, the plaintiffs submitted FOIA requests to each of the defendants for any agency records that the defendants prepared, received, transmitted, collected or maintained that concerned the policies, procedures and guidelines with respect to the Immigration and Nationality Act as well as a request for expedited processing.  However, none of the defendants had made any determination as to whether they would comply with the plaintiffs’ request for the documents.  The defendants also denied the plaintiffs request for expedited processing, even though the plaintiffs claimed that these documents were necessary to educate the public about time critical government activities.\n\nOn February 3, 2015, Judge Lorna G. Schofield ordered that the parties submitted to the Court a proposed schedule for the production of documents responsive to the plaintiffs' request.  On February 13, 2015, the parties agreed on the number of pages each defendant should produce and review per month, until all responsive documents were gathered.\n\nThe parties settled on June 6, 2017. The defendants agreed to pay different amounts of money to the Plaintiffs, as the following: (i) $16,800 should be paid by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement; (ii) $21,600 should be paid by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services; and (iii) $9,600 should be paid by the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. The parties provided that the settlement agreement did not constitute an admission by the US or its agencies, including defendants, that plaintiffs or their counsels were entitled to fees and costs.

{"document": "This case deals with the Trump Administration's effort to require state police departments to cooperate in immigration enforcement, which was part of the implementation of Executive Order 13768, which promised in January 2017 to deny federal grant funding to “sanctuary jurisdictions.” The lawsuit began on July 18, 2018, when the States of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, and Virginia (“the States”) a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) (formally, the Attorney General) under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Ex Parte Young. The States, represented by their Attorneys General as well as outside counsel, claimed that the DOJ had violated the Separation of Powers, the APA and the Tenth Amendment Anti-Commandeering requirement; they sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n\nIn their complaint, the States challenged the DOJ’s implementation of new conditional requirements for Byrne JAG funds in the 2017 Fiscal Year (“FY”). The Byrne JAG program provides funding for States, allowing them to prioritize chosen criminal justice programs. On July 25, 2017, the DOJ announced that applicants for FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds would have to agree to three immigration-related conditions: (1) to allow federal agents, upon request, access to correctional facilities in order to question suspected noncitizens about their right to be in or stay in the United States, (2) to respond to requests from the Department of Homeland Security to give advance notice of the scheduled release date and time of noncitizens at state or local correctional facilities, and (3) to comply with various conditions related to 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which included prohibiting states and localities from restricting  their officials from communicating with immigration authorities regarding anyone’s citizenship or immigration status, monitoring compliance of all subgrantees, and notifying the DOJ if the State became aware of evidence that a subgrantee was not in compliance.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Edgardo Ramos on July 19, 2018. Shortly after, on July 26, 2019, the Court accepted the plaintiffs’ request in <i> <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16713 \"> The City of New York v. Whitaker </a> </i>, 1:18-cv-06474 to relate that case, brought by the City of New York, with this one; the NYC action was against the same defendants for the same conduct.\n\nOn July 20, 2018, the DOJ released the FY 2018 State Solicitation. In the FY 2018 version, the DOJ added to the conditions the States must meet in order to be eligible for the funds. In response, on August 6, 2018, the States submitted an amended complaint, adding the State of Rhode Island as a plaintiff and addressing the new FYI 2018 conditions. \n\nOn August 17, 2018, both the States and the City filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The States requested summary judgment on the portions of the complaint related to FY 2017, seeking specifically declaratory judgment that the immigration conditions placed the program were unlawful, an injunction that enjoined the defendants from imposing those conditions nationwide, and a writ of mandamus directing the defendants to disburse New York City’s FY 2017 award and to issue new awards without the three conditions to all grantees nationwide that previously received the award documents. \n\nThe ACLU filed an Amicus Brief on August 31, 2018 in support of the plaintiffs. They argued that the actions taken by the defendants to put immigration-related conditions on the JAG funds were inappropriate claims to authority because they upset the balance of power between state governments and the federal government, and that their imposed conditions were negatively impacting the plaintiffs’ ability to supervise their own police forces. \n\nOn September 14, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss both this case and the related City of New York case, arguing that the immigration-related conditions on the JAG funds did not violate the Separation of Powers, that Congress delegated authority to the DOJ to place conditions on the grants, that the conditions did not violate the Spending Clause because the conditions bear a relationship to the purposes of the Byrne JAG Program, and that even if the Court were to grant an injunction it should be limited to the parties rather than nationwide.\n\nOn November 30, 2018, Judge Ramos issued an opinion and order denying the defendant’s motion for partial summary judgment, or in the alternative, motion to dismiss, and granting the plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment. 343 F. Supp 3d 213. Judge Ramos granted summary judgment on the States’ and the City’s claims holding that: <ul><li>Notice, Access and Compliance conditions were ultra vires and not in accordance with law under APA (Counts II and III, City Count II) </li><li>8 U.S.C. sec. 1373(a)-(b) insofar as it applies to states and localities was facially unconstitutional under the anti-commandeering doctrine of the Tenth Amendment (Count V, City Count V and XI) </li><li>Notice, Access, and Compliance Conditions violated constitutional separation of powers (Count I, City Count I). Deny City Count IV (violation of the Spending Clause) as moot</li><li>The notice, access, compliance conditions were arbitrary and capricious under the APA (Count IV, city Count III) </ul>He ordered the defendants to: <ul><li>Disburse the FY 2017 Byrne JAG awards to the States</li><li>Stop enforcing the immigration-related conditions it tried to impose on the State’s FY 2017 Byrne JAG awards</li><li>Reissue the States’ FY 2017 Byrne JAG documents without the immigration-related conditions</ul>In his ruling, Judge Ramos declined to issue a nationwide injunction, as requested by the plaintiffs. He noted that such a move was not necessary to afford the plaintiffs’ relief and that the scope of decisions by other district courts in like cases has been similarly limited.\n\nAfter a conference, Judge Ramos modified the opinion and removed the requirement to reissue the documents to the States on January 4, 2019.\n\nOn January 28, 2019, the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit of the injunction issued against the defendants in the district court’s November 30, 2018 opinion and order. \n\nBack in the district court, the plaintiffs again filed a motion for partial summary on March 1, 2019. The plaintiffs requested summary judgment on the portions of the complaint related to FY 2018 and sought declaratory judgment that the immigration conditions placed the program were unlawful, an injunction that enjoined the defendants from imposing those conditions, and a writ of mandamus directing defendants to disburse New York City’s FY 2018 award and to issue new awards without the three conditions to all grantees that previously received the award documents. On April 12, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or alternatively, partial summary judgment.\n\nOn February 26, 2020, a Second Circuit panel (Circuit Judges Ralph Winter, Jose Cabranes, and Reena Raggi) issued an opinion reversing the district court's award of partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs, vacating the district court's mandate and injunction, and remanding the case to the district court. Judge Raggi, writing for the panel, concluded that the plain language of the relevant statutes authorized the Attorney General to impose all three challenged conditions on Byrne grant applications. Judge Raggi found that these conditions help to enforce national immigration laws and policies and that they ensure that applicants \"satisfy particular statutory grant requirements imposed by Congress and subject to Attorney General oversight.\" Additionally, Judge Raggi, relying on a Supreme Court decision in <i>Arizona v. United States</i> that made clear States may not pursue policies that undermine federal law, held that the challenged conditions intrude on the powers reserved to the States. Finally, Judge Raggi concluded that in imposing the challenged conditions, the Attorney General did not overlook their important detrimental effects so as to make their imposition arbitrary and capricious. 951 F.3d 84. \n\nAs of March 3, 2020, the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment is pending before the district court and the case is ongoing.

In 2018, a judge granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. In 2019, the defendants appealed this judgment. And later, the plaintiffs made a motion for summary judgment on the 2018 immigration-related conditions. In February 2020, a Second Circuit panel reversed the district court's order granting partial summary judgment, vacated the mandate and injunction, and remanded the case to the district court, concluding that the Attorney General was statutorily authorized to impose the challenged conditions and that the imposition of these conditions was not arbitrary and capricious.

In response, on July 24, 2020, several immigration advocacy and nonprofit organizations filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, sued the Bureau of the Census, the President of the United States, the Director of the United States Census Bureau, the United States Department of Commerce, and the Secretary of Commerce. The plaintiffs claimed that by excluding “undocumented immigrants from: (a) the tabulation of the total population of the states; (b) the calculation and statement of the whole number of persons in each state; and (c) the calculation and statement of the apportionment of the House of Representatives among the states” the defendants were violating the Constitution and the laws of the United States. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, a writ of mandamus compelling the President to apportion the House of representatives among states based on actual enumeration of the population, including undocumented immigrants, and attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs allege excluding undocumented immigrants violated the Enumeration and Apportionment clauses of the US Constitution (Article I, Sec. 2, Cl. 3 and Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment) which require all persons to be included in the congressional apportionment base. They also alleged that the memo violated their right to equal protection because it denied undocumented immigrants personhood under the Constitution on the basis of race and national origin and was motivated by a desire to harm immigrant communities of color (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments ). The complaint further contended violations of the Census Act (2 U.S.C. § 2a(a); 13 U.S.C. § 141), Separation of Powers (Article I, Sec. 2, Cl. 3 of the Constitution, as amended by the Fourteenth Amendment), and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Lewis J.

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Sections 7 and 9 of that act, which impose tax penalties on businesses that do not check the work eligibility of all of their employees in a federal database and allow discharged employees to bring discrimination suits against their employers for employing unauthorized workers, were preempted by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).\n\nPlaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on the same day that they filed their complaint, and defendants moved to dismiss the claim on February 20, 2008.

Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief preventing the implementation of a Directive issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\" (\"the Directive\") and a Memorandum entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion Consistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Priorities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of Aliens\" (the \"Morton Memorandum\"). Plaintiffs claimed that the Directive commanded ICE officers to violate federal law, compelled them to violate their oaths of office, violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), unconstitutionally usurped and encroached upon the legislative powers of Congress, as defined in Article I of the United States Constitution, and violated the obligation of the executive branch to faithfully execute the law, as required by Article II, Section 3, of the United States Constitution.  On October 10, 2012, the ICE employees were joined by the State of Mississippi as a plaintiff in an Amended Complaint.\n\nOn January 24, 2013, the Court (Judge Reed C. O'Connor) granted in part and denied in part the government's November 13, 2012 Motion to Dismiss.  Crane v. Napolitano, 920 F.Supp.2d 724 (N.D. Tex. 2013). The Court held that venue was appropriate in the Northern District of Texas.  With respect to several of the ICE Agent Plaintiffs' causes of action the Court found that these Plaintiffs had not suffered an injury-in-fact, and therefore lacked standing to pursue the claims.  In particular, the Court found that even if following the Directive and the Morton Memorandum did require them to violate their oaths to uphold the Constitution, and to alter their employment conduct, neither effect injured them concretely enough to support standing.  However, the Court found that the allegation that the Directive and Memo compelled the plaintiffs to violate a federal statute upon pain of adverse employment action did satisfy the requirements of standing. (With respect to one additional asserted cause of action, relating to the issuance of employment authorization to aliens covered by the Directive/Memo, the Court noted that the plaintiffs were not involved in employment authorization decisions and did not articulate a way in which employment authorization harmed them personally. Thus, the Court dismissed without prejudice Plaintiffs' third cause of action.)\n\nWith respect to the State of Mississippi, the court found that Mississippi's asserted fiscal injury was purely speculative because there was no concrete evidence that the costs associated with the presence of illegal aliens in the state of Mississippi have increased or will increase as a result of the Directive or the Morton Memorandum. The Court held that Mississippi failed to allege an injury-in-fact sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirements of standing and dismissed the state of Mississippi's claims without prejudice.\n\nThe federal government also asserted that this Court lacks jurisdiction because Plaintiffs' claims are federal employment disputes subject to the Civil Service Reform Act (\"CSRA\"), but the Court deferred ruling on this claim until trial because Defendant's claim that the CSRA precludes federal-court jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims had been inadequately briefed.\n\nOn April 23, 2013, the Court (Judge Reed O'Connor) held a hearing regarding Plaintiffs' Application for Preliminary Injunctive Relief. The Court concluded that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Directive and related provisions of the Morton Memorandum violate 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(A), but deferred ruling until the parties provided the Court with additional briefing regarding the CSRA dispute. Crane v. Napolitano, 2013 WL 1744422 (N.D. Tex. 2013).\n\nThe CSRA was then fully briefed, and on July 31, 2013, the Court (Judge Reed C.

Plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\">denied class certification</a> on Jan. 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David v. Signal International</i></a>. The amended complaint, filed on behalf of 21 individuals, asserted claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. §1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. §1590 (trafficking)), the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. §1962), the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. §1981), the Ku Kux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. §1985), the Thirteenth Amendment, as well as claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs were represented by the Equal Justice Center and the Transnational Worker Rights Clinic.\n\nPlaintiffs were allegedly brought into the United States to provide labor and services to defendant Signal International. Signal was based in Pascagoula, Mississippi and was in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs in the Gulf Coast region. One plaintiff worked in Pascagoula; the remaining plaintiffs worked at Signal's Orange, Texas site. The complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid defendant Signal's recruiters as much as $25,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States found out they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, Plaintiffs were forced to pay additional fees ($1050 per month) to live in racially segregated labor camps, and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. \n\nIn July 2014, U.S. Magistrate Judge Zack Hawthorn denied Signal's motion to transfer this case to the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs in this case only overlapped with the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David</i></a> case insofar as their FLSA claims in the <i>David</i> case were concerned. Magistrate Judge Hawthorn found the similarity in issues in the cases not substantial enough to warrant transfer because the current venue was otherwise proper. \n\nIn June 2015, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn severed and transferred Signal's cross-claims against co-defendants (immigration attorneys, recruiters, and labor brokers) to the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n\nTrial was set for December 2015. However, in July 2015, the Court stayed the case after Signal filed for bankruptcy. <i>In re Signal Int’l, Inc, et al.,</i> No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015). As a part of the bankruptcy filings, the plaintiffs entered into a plan support agreement (PSA) which contemplated a settlement of the claims of this lawsuit against Signal entities through a consensual Chapter 11 plan proposed by Signal. The PSA, with a liquidation trust for distribution of settlement proceeds, became effective on Dec. 14, 2015.\n\nIn Dec. 2015, in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14378\">related EEOC case</a>, the EEOC announced that the parties had reached a <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/12-18-15.cfm\">settlement</a> for all cases, approved by the bankruptcy court. Signal would pay $5 million to 476 guestworkers through a claims process. All aggrieved individuals included in the litigation could receive relief in spite of the bankruptcy proceedings. Signal's CEO also issued an apology for its conduct.\n\nIn this case, the parties were to update the court every 120 days as to the status of the bankruptcy proceedings. The parties' report on July 5, 2018 noted that 20 of the 21 plaintiffs had reached a settlement with the Burnett (immigration attorney) defendants, and the remaining one plaintiff could not be located. The plaintiffs advised that they would be dismissing their claims against them soon because the Burnett defendants had met their obligations under the settlement. Plaintiffs requested the stay remain in effect as to the Signal defendants and Dewan (recruiter) defendants.\n\nOn August 24, 2018, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn issued a report and recommendation to dismiss without prejudice the one remaining plaintiff who did not respond to the court’s order. District Judge Ron Judge Clark adopted the report and recommendation on September 12, 2018 and dismissed this plaintiff without prejudice. \n\nThe case is ongoing as to the Signal defendants and Dewan defendants.

{"document": "On October 26, 2015, sixteen undocumented immigrants formerly detained in Dallas County, Texas, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued Dallas County and the Dallas County Sheriff under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought damages and an injunction preventing the defendants from detaining the plaintiffs solely based on a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an immigration hold, or an immigration detainer. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had violated their constitutional rights by holding them in Dallas County jails for an additional 48 hours after the time they would otherwise have been released, in order to facilitate their arrest by ICE. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants unlawfully detained them by prohibiting bond or by failing to release them even after they had been cleared. The case was assigned to Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater.  \n\nOn December 18, 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and to dismiss the claims against Sheriff Valdez based on qualified immunity. On January 8, 2016, the case was consolidated with another action brought by the same counsel against Dallas County on behalf of a group of plaintiffs asserting identical claims (3:15-cv-4008).\n\nOn June 7, 2016, Judge Fitzwater granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, but also granted the plaintiffs leave to replead. Judge Fitzwater held that the plaintiffs had failed to plausibly alleged that they had either paid bail or were otherwise eligible for release but were detained solely on the basis of an ICE-issued request to detain. The court also found that the plaintiffs had not plausibly alleged that Dallas County lacked probable cause to detain the plaintiffs after they were otherwise eligible for release. 2016 WL 3166306.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 5, 2016. The complaint provided facts demonstrating that Dallas County had not allowed pretrial release even where the detainee paid bond. Instead, the defendants would either continue holding the detainee for transfer to ICE, or would petition the court to find the bail insufficient. The plaintiffs alleged that because of this policy, some detainees chose not to pay bail because they knew doing so would be futile. The complaint further alleged that continuing to hold the plaintiffs after they would have otherwise been cleared for release without probable cause as to a different criminal offense constituted overdetention. The amended complaint did not list Sheriff Lupe Valdez as a defendant. \n\nDallas County then moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On January 17, 2017, Judge Fitzwater denied in part and granted in part the defendant's motion. He held that the plaintiffs had standing and could bring suit for violations of the Fourth Amendment. He dismissed the plaintiffs' due process claims under the Fourteenth Amendment because the claims were already 'covered by' the Fourth Amendment. 2017 WL 169102. \n\nOn May 8, 2017, Judge Fitzwater granted a motion allowing the state of Texas to intervene as a defendant in the case. \n\nOn June 16, 2017, Judge Fitzwater granted the plaintiffs’ request to consolidate this case with a related one, <i>Delcid Bonilla v. Dallas County</i> (3:17-cv-201). The plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint reflecting the consolidation and the additional plaintiffs. \n\nDue to the complexity of the case, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a bellwether trial plan on November 15, 2017. They proposed using five exemplary plaintiffs to represent the 45 named plaintiffs in order to make discovery significantly less expensive and avoid a lengthy trial. \n\nOn March 9, 2018, the case was reassigned to Judge Karen Gren Scholer. \n\nOn March 30, 2018, Judge Scholer denied the plaintiffs' motion for a bellwether trial plain. \n\nOn April 20, 2018, the defendants moved for summary judgment. \n\nOver the next several months, twenty-six of the plaintiffs dismissed their claims with prejudice. Eighteen other plaintiffs fell out of contact with counsel and were designated by the court as pro se.\n\nAs of October 18, 2018, there was only one plaintiff still represented by counsel and pursuing a claim. That plaintiff had reached an oral agreement to settle his claim with the defendants. \n\nOn October 26, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the pro se plaintiffs for lack of prosecution and failure to respond to discovery. \n\nOn November 30, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion for entry of an agreed final judgment between the remaining plaintiff and the defendants. The motion stated that the parties had entered into a private settlement agreement.\n\nOn December 4, 2018, Judge Scholer ordered entry of the final judgment, whereby the state of Texas agreed to pay the remaining plaintiff $9,500 in complete and total satisfaction of all his claims. \n\nOn January 7, 2019, Judge Scholer dismissed the pro se plaintiffs' claims with prejudice. \n\nThe case is closed. \n", "summary": "On October 26, 2015, sixteen undocumented immigrants formerly detained in Dallas County, Texas, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.

{"document": "After being imprisoned in Bexar County Adult Detention Center (BCADA) for about 75 days after his criminal charges were dismissed, an individual filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas August 26, 2016. Bexar County detained the plaintiff, despite the dismissal, of his criminal charges under a Bexar County policy and practice that detains individuals whenever Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents asks them to do so. The plaintiff filed suit against Bexar County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and against the ICE officers and employees responsible for his illegal detention under <i>Bivens</i>. He claimed violations of his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments; and claims for declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, sought declaratory relief, monetary relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was initially assigned to Chief Judge Orlando L. Garcia.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 18, 2016, adding claims for violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act and adding the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of ICE as defendants. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to issue detainers in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act’s requirements and that these defendants were charged with administering and enforcing the Act\n\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment, and Judge Garcia granted in part and denied in part both motions on June 5, 2017. The court determined that the County's actions in detaining the plaintiff without establishing probable cause met the deliberate-indifference standard necessary to show a constitutional violation. The plaintiff was thus awarded partial summary judgment and damages on the § 1983 claim to be free from unreasonable search and seizures against the County. The court denied the § 1983 claim relating to the County's policy of requiring receipt of judicial authorization by fax or email before dismissing a detainee, because the plaintiff did not adequately plead that this policy was the moving force behind the constitutional violations. The court thus granted partial summary judgment to the defendant. 2017 WL 2896021. The defendants immediately filed a motion for reconsideration.\n\nAt the same time, on May 23, 2017, the parties filed a joint motion to consolidate the present case with <i>Trujillo v. United States </i>, 5:17-cv-00054-OLG, because the legal and factual issues were similar. In <i>Trujillo v. United States </i>, 5:17-cv-00054-OLG, the same plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the United States seeking damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act for his false imprisonment. The following day, the court granted this motion to avoid unnecessary cost or delay and to promote the administration of justice. \n\nThe Secretary of DHS, the Director of ICE, and the ICE San Antonio Field Officer moved to dismiss the FTCA claims and stay the case on August 18, 2017. The motion to dismiss was granted as to DHS, ICE, and other federal employees and the motion to stay was denied on October 18, 2017. 2017 WL 6033861. The plaintiff appealed to the Fifth Circuit on November 10, 2017 and the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction (Docket #17-51005). \n\nBack in the district court, the court reconsidered the issue after briefing. On January 17, 2019, the court vacated their original granting of the plaintiff's summary judgment motion. They instead granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and ordered the case to be closed. \n\nOn February 11, 2019, the plaintiff appealed the case to the Fifth Circuit (Docket # 19-50124).

{"document": "On May 3, 2011, a coalition of immigrant rights groups and individual immigrants filed this class action lawsuit against the State of Utah in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, challenging the state's immigration-enforcement law, House Bill 497 (HB 497). HB 497 was a severe, anti-immigrant law that criminalized everyday activities, such as driving an undocumented immigrant to the store and authorized police to stop and detail an individual simply to verify his or her immigration status. The plaintiffs, represented by the state and national ACLU, the National Immigration Law Center, and private counsel, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983; the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201; and state law, claiming that the law was unconstitutional.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs claimed that HB 497, in requiring state and local law enforcement to check the identification of all people they stop, arrest or detain and ascertain whether they are in the country lawfully; allowing them to make warrantless arrests on \"reasonable suspicion\" that a person is an alien who is (1) subject to a removal order by an immigration court, (2) subject to an immigration detainer request, or (3) charged or convicted in another state with one or more \"aggravated felonies;\" and criminalizing the act of encouraging or inducing illegal immigrants to come to, enter or reside in Utah, is preempted under the Supremacy Clause and in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs sought a declaration of the law's unconstitutionality and an injunction barring enforcement of the law before it came into effect on May 10, 2011. \n\nIn passing HB 497, Utah became the first state to follow the lead of Arizona in enacting aggressive immigration-related laws at the state level; Indiana, Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina were soon to follow. For the case challenging the Arizona's SB 1070, see <i>United States v. Arizona</i> [IM-AZ-0015]; for the case challenging Indiana's SEA 590, see <i>Buquer v. City of Indianapolis </i> [IM-IN-0002]; for the case challenging Georgia's HB 87, see <i>Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights v. Deal</i> [IM-GA-0007]; for cases challenging Alabama's HB 56, see <i>United States v. Alabama </i>[IM-AL-0005], Hispanic Interest Coalition v. Bentley [IM-AL-0006], and Parsley v. Bentley [IM-AL-0007]; and for cases challenging South Carolina's Act 69, see Lowcountry Immigration Coalition v. Haley [IM-SC-0001] and United States v. South Carolina [IM-SC-0002].\n\nOn May 6, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing on May 10, the district court (Judge Clark Waddoups) issued a temporary restraining order on May 11, barring enforcement of HB 497 pending further order of the court and giving parties time to brief the court regarding the merits of plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2011 WL 7143098 (D. Utah May 11, 2011).\n\nOver the course of the summer, various amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of plaintiffs, including those by the governments of Mexico and various Central and South American countries.\n\nOn August 1, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.\n\nOn November 22, 2011, the federal government filed a separate lawsuit challenging the Utah law solely on preemption grounds. It was consolidated with this case on November 28, and on December 15, the Department of Justice filed its own motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nRather than deciding on any of the motions before it, on February 21, 2012, the district court declared that it would refrain from making any rulings until the Supreme Court issued its decision in United States v. Arizona (IM-AZ-0015) but confirmed that the restraining order would continue until it ruled on the pending motions for preliminary injunction.\n\nWhile the district court awaited the Supreme Court’s decision, the plaintiffs filed several notices of supplemental authority in 2013 to support its pending motions for preliminary injunctions. The plaintiffs cited circuit court decisions and argued that those provided further support that HB 497 was unconstitutional on Supremacy Clause grounds. \n\nOnce the Supreme Court ruled on all but few motions for United States v. Arizona, Judge Waddoups ruled on all three pending motions for preliminary injunctions on June 18, 2014. First, the court ruled against the United States and plaintiffs’ overall facial challenge against HB 497 as a whole because the constitutional language did not expressly preempt all immigration-related state legislation, and the Supreme Court did not hold that the entire field of immigration regulation is either conflict or field preempted. But the court ruled against the key provisions of HB 497, such as Section 10 and 11, which granted warrantless arrest based solely on suspicion of immigration status and made it criminal to assist or encourage undocumented immigrants. The court also put strict limits on when the police could check the identification of detained individuals to verify immigration status. 26 F. Supp. 3d 1125. HB 497 was unconstitutional because it unlawfully interfered with federal power and authority over immigration matters in violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and authorized and required unreasonable seizures and arrests in violation of the Fourth Amendment. \n\nOn November 25, 2014, the parties filed a joint report regarding the discussions toward agreeing on a proposed final judgment in light of the court’s preliminary injunction decision. In the proposed final judgment, the State of Utah agreed to permanently scrap the key problematic provisions of HB 497 and implement the remaining sections under restriction. For example, the parties agreed to severely limit Sections 3 and 4 of HB 497, which made it clear that police are not allowed to stop or detain an individual simply to verify their immigration status. The terms of the settlement made clear that the law does not require Utahns to carry identification with them at all times, following the federal district court decision. \n\nOn December 4, 2014, the district court entered a judgment per the parties’ proposed final judgment and dismissed without prejudice the plaintiffs’ and the United States’ remaining claims that were not yet adjudicated. On April 28, 2015, the parties notified the court about the settlement of attorney fees and costs and later advised the Court that the payment has been made. The case is now closed.", "summary": "This is one in a series of cases challenging comprehensive state immigration laws.

The plaintiffs, represented by the various public interest organizations including the ACLU of Vermont, Center for Constitutional Rights, the National Immigration Law Center, as well as private counsel, sought injunctive, monetary, and declaratory relief, claiming violations of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, as well as federal tort claims, including Invasion of Privacy, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and False Imprisonment. \n\nThe plaintiffs, organizers and advocates for immigrant farmworkers, alleged that ICE has retaliated against them in response to their advocacy and public criticism, thereby chilling their speech and interfering with their freedom of association. As a result, Migrant Justice claimed that it had to take extensive and costly precautions, limiting its overall reach to the community. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that ICE has infiltrated their meetings; targeted, surveilled, and engaged in disinformation campaigns to sow distrust among their members; and arrested and/or detained twenty active Migrant Justice members pursuant to an unlawful retaliatory policy. The plaintiffs further alleged that DMV employees consistently share personally identifying information about plaintiffs with ICE in a manner that disproportionately targets and impacts non-white and Latinx residents. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 7, 2019, removing one member of the organization as a plaintiff. There were no other substantive changes made to the complaint.\n\nOn January 21, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice as to Wanda Minoli, the Commissioner of the Vermont DMV after entering into a settlement. The DMV agreed to not share immigration or citizenship information with ICE, DHS, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and to implement new protocols to protect against such disclosures, including training for its law enforcement employees, counter staff, and managers. The settlement also included improvements to the DMV's language access services. The DMV agreed to 18 months of auditing and $100,000 in attorneys' fees: $20,000 would go to the plaintiffs and $80,000 would be set aside for the DMV's costs in complying with the settlement.\n\nOn October 28, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice after entering into a settlement with the remaining defendants.

ICE also promised to tell its agents that immigrants, regardless of immigration status, are protected by the First Amendment and have the right to freedom of speech and assembly.

The Travel Ban indefinitely banned millions of nationals of five Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Pars Equality Center and OneAmerica are immigrant and refugee advocacy organizations, and the individual plaintiffs are U.S. citizens, foreign nationals lawfully present in the U.S., and individuals abroad who were been affected by the Travel Ban and the implementation of its waiver provision. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, alleging that the waiver process under the Travel Ban was being implemented in an unduly restrictive manner, violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs—represented by private counsel, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the National Immigration Law Center, and the International Refugee Assistance Project—sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. Specifically, the plaintiffs requested that the waiver provision be enjoined, that any agency guidance and policies implementing that provision be vacated and remanded to the agencies, and that the agencies be directed to issue new guidance in conformance with the APA, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Constitution. \n\nFurthermore, the plaintiffs sought to define the class as: \"Individuals in the United States with an approved petition to be reunited with family members who are (i) a national of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen, (ii) subject to the Proclamation, and (iii) currently awaiting a decision on a waiver or have been denied a waiver; Nationals of the Designated Countries who are lawfully present in the United States who, but for the uncertainty created by the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of the waiver provision, wish to travel abroad and return to the United States; and Individuals who have applied for a visa who are (i) nationals of the Designated Countries, (ii) subject to the Proclamation, and (iii) currently awaiting a decision on a waiver or have been denied a waiver.\" The case was assigned to Judge Benjamin H.

Judge James Donato was assigned to the case.\n\nOn February 20, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to either consolidate this case with the <i>Emami</i> case or stay this case pending the outcome of the proceedings in <i>Emami</i> to avoid duplicative litigation. The plaintiffs opposed the defendants' proposed complete merger of this case with <i>Emami</i>, arguing that such a merger would unnecessarily delay these proceedings further and deprive this case of its independent character. \n\nThe court heard oral argument on April 11, 2019, and decided to allow both cases to proceed, with the understanding that the parties would have to communicate so as to prevent any duplicative actions.

The named plaintiff, who was a female citizen arrested for a DWI, alleged that she was forced to strip naked, such that she was nude from the waist up in the presence of male officers not involved in her search.  The search was videotaped.  Plaintiff alleged that her treatment was the result of the official Humboldt County Jail policy, in which officers routinely subjected detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the detainees possessed contraband or weapons, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and California state law.  Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages and class certification.\n\nAfter the parties engaged in discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment.  The District Court (Saundra Brown Armstrong) found that plaintiff failed to present any evidence of similar complaints, which negated that a custom or practice of improper searches existed at the Jail.  As such, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the County of Humboldt and its Sheriff on plaintiff's municipal liability claim.  Spellman v. Humboldt County, 2006 WL 1626922 (N.D.Cal.

The plaintiffs, represented by the Prison Law Office, Disability Rights California, and private counsel, sought injunctive and declaratory relief. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant violated prisoners' Constitutional rights by failing to provide minimally adequate health care and failing to protect prisoners from injury and violence from other prisoners.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Lawrence J. O'Neill and Magistrate Judge Barbara A. McAuliffe. On January 25, 2012, the plaintiffs amended their complaint to add three individual plaintiffs to the suit, and brought additional claims against the defendants under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The plaintiffs also expanded the scope of the injunctive relief requested, seeking the compulsion of reasonable accommodations to prisoners with disabilities. \n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint due to failure to state a claim for which the court could provide a remedy. Judge O'Neill denied this motion on May 16, 2012, finding that the plaintiffs' complaint had sufficiently pleaded their claims. 2012 WL 1799179. \n\nThe parties stipulated to and the Court ordered the substitution of the individual defendants with the county of Fresno on November 16, 2012. This stipulation also dismissed the claims of three of the named plaintiffs, without prejudice.   \n\nOn May 28, 2015, the parties filed a joint motion for preliminary approval of the consent decree they had drafted.

The plaintiffs' counsel agreed to be responsible for monitoring compliance with the consent decree and the remedial plan. The decree was court enforceable, and the parties agreed it would last for four years after its approval -- unless the court earlier determined that the defendants were in substantial\ncompliance, or it was extended based on non-compliance.  The defendant also agreed to pay the plaintiffs' counsel $900,000 in attorneys' fees and $40,000 per year for monitoring fees and expenses.

The plaintiffs sued Alameda County and the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for violations of their rights under the U.S. Constitution and state law.  Represented by private counsel, they sought monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief. \n\nSpecifically, the complaint alleges that pregnant women prisoners were denied medical attention and other accommodations including weather-appropriate clothing, nutritious food, feminine hygiene products, and fresh air.  The specific conduct targeted toward pregnant women took place within an environment marked by general hostility toward women prisoners and indifference to women’s medical and hygienic needs.  Further, the complaint alleged that the Alameda County Jail systematically discriminated against the women prisoners, compared to men prisoners, in access to reasonable facilities and services.  In the complaint, the women prisoners sought recognition of class certification consisting of a main class of women prisoners with a sub-class of pregnant prisoners.  The plaintiffs claimed that the conduct of the Alameda County Jail staff violated women prisoners’ rights protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.   \n\nOn the same day that the initial complaint was filed, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent further harm to the pregnant plaintiffs.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This putative class-action lawsuit, brought by inmates in Orange County Jail, argued that county and the sheriff violated the U.S. Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in failing to provide adequate care amidst the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The court granted the motion for provisional class-certification and partially granted a temporary restraining order, but the defendants appealed and the Supreme Court stayed the injunctive relief while the appeals to the Ninth Circuit proceeded.<hr>\n\nThis putative class-action lawsuit was filed on April 30, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The lawsuit was filed by several inmates in Orange County Jail. The suit arose out of the COVID-19 pandemic that swept the world in early 2020. As the virus raged throughout the country, it became particularly problematic in jails and prison systems. This lawsuit alleged that Orange County Jail's management of the virus was wholly inadequate and in violation of the U.S. Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The suit alleged that requisite social distancing was not possible due to the high density of inmates in the jail, that the masks were simply pieces of fabric (and were not always used by guards), and that isolation policies were ineffective. The plaintiffs were medically vulnerable inmates in Orange County Jail and they were represented by ACLU National, ACLU Fund of Southern California, and ACLU Disabilities Rights Program attorneys, the UC Irvine Civil Rights Litigation Clinic, and private counsel. They sued Orange County and the Sheriff of Orange County.\n\nThe complaint alleged that defendants' failure to adequately mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the jail system represented violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. They argued that the conditions represented an unconstitutional punishment and unconstitutional confinement in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees that the state provide for reasonable health and safety of inmates. As for the Eighth Amendment, they argued that the lack of precautions constituted deliberate indifference to the health of the inmates as to be cruel and unusual punishment. The plaintiffs also argued that the failure to protect medically vulnerable inmates (particularly those with co-morbidities), constituted discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, a writ of habeas corpus to identify all members of a Medically-Vulnerable Subclass and Disability Subclass and grant them release, injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, or habeas corpus that would mitigate the spread of COVID-19, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. \n\nOn May 11, the plaintiffs submitted an application for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction and a motion for provisional class certification. On May 26, the court granted the motion for provisional class-certification and granted in part and denied in part the application for a temporary restraining order. The grant of provisional class status created two classes, a Pre-Trial Class and a Post-Conviction Class. Under each of those were Disability Subclasses and Medically-Vulnerable Subclasses. The partial grant of the TRO mandated defendants to follow CDC social distancing guidelines, expand testing, and enhance sanitation efforts in the jails. It did not grant release to any prisoners, though. 2020 WL 2754938.\n\nDefendants appealed this decision two days later and applied to stay the case pending a decision from the 9th Circuit (docket #: 20-55568). In both the district court and the 9th Circuit, the defendants filed emergency motions to stay the lower court decision, but the district court denied this motion on June 2. 2020 WL 4039073. The 9th Circuit then denied this motion on June 17. However, they remanded the case to the district court to gauge whether any changed circumstances might require alterations to the TRO. 2020 WL 3547960.\n\nThe defendants then filed an ex parte application with the district court to dissolve the TRO, which the district court denied yet again in late June. The defendants tried to argue that the declining rate of COVID-19 in the Orange County Jail represented a significant enough change to warrant dissolution of the preliminary injunction. On July 1, the defendants appealed once more to the 9th Circuit (docket #: 20-55668). And, once again, the 9th Circuit denied the motion on July 3.\n\nThen on July 21, the defendants brought the case to the Supreme Court, submitting an emergency application for stay of injunctive relief. In a 5-4 decision, the Court granted the stay on August 5. There was no majority, opinion, but Justice Sotomayor wrote a dissent arguing that, even if the majority would have granted the stay at the district court, it was not so clearly wrong as to warrant granting certiorari. 2020 WL 4499350.\n\nOn August 25, the plaintiffs filed motions to dismiss as moot each of the pending appeals in the 9th Circuit. They argued that the preliminary injunction had expired and therefore the appeals were moot. The defendants sought to continue litigating the appeals and alleged that without review by the appellate court, there was nothing to stop the district court from entering preliminary injunctions every 90 days throughout the life of the case. On October 15, 2020, the two appeals were consolidated.\n\nThe case is ongoing and in discovery as of February 17, 2021.", "summary": "This putative class-action lawsuit, brought by inmates in Orange County Jail, argued that county and the sheriff violated the U.S. Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in failing to provide adequate care amidst the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, and applied in both the district court and the Ninth Circuit to stay the case in the lower court until the appeals court had ruled. Both denied these applications, however the Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court saying that the defendants could try to modify the injunction if there were any changed circumstances. Defendants did so, but the district court denied any modifications once again. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which likewise rejected the defendants' motion. Finally, the defendants went to the Supreme Court and asked them to stay the injunction while the Ninth Circuit heard the case on the merits. The Supreme Court obliged on August 5, staying the injunction.\r\n\r\nThe case is ongoing as of February 17, 2021."}
{"document": "On February 23, 2006, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, plaintiffs filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs claimed that D.C. Jail officials violated their Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendment rights in detaining them beyond their release dates and violated their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for conducting blanket strip searches.\n\nThe Barnes case followed a nearly identical class action lawsuit styled Bynum v. District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 02-956 (RCL), <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=5502\">JC-DC-0004</a> in this Clearinghouse.  The Bynum case resulted in a $14 million settlement.  \n\nThe Barnes plaintiffs alleged that while the District agreed to stop its practices of overdetention and strip searches, and did so in the context of the Bynum settlement. The Final Approval Order in the Bynum case did not require that those practices stop.  The Barnes plaintiffs alleged that despite the Bynum settlement, the unlawful practices of overdetention and strip searches had been reconstituted, such that injunctive relief was now necessary.\n\nThe Barnes plaintiffs, who were represented by some of the same attorneys as in Bynum, sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe District moved to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment.  That motion was denied on March 26, 2007, by the District Court (Judge Royce C. Lamberth).  The Court certified an Overdetention Class and a Strip Search class, just as it had done in the Bynum case.\n\nOn January 20, 2011, the plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint for individual money damages and class injunctive relief and jury demand. Following the close of liability discovery, the parties cross-motions for summary judgment were granted in part and denied in part.\n\nOn June 24, 2011, the District Court (Judge Lamberth) ruled on both parties' summary judgment motions. Judge Lamberth granted the plaintiffs summary judgment on their claims related to the strip searches and on the District’s liability for overdetentions from 2005 to 2006. Judge Lamberth granted the District summary judgment on its claims of overdetentions from 2008 to the present. 793 F. Supp. 2d 260 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\nThen, the plaintiffs asked for leave to file another amended complaint. The parties moved again for summary judgement. But on December 7, 2011, the District Court (Judge Lamberth) held that 1) the court would not grant the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint and that the court would not entertain further motions for summary judgment. Judge Lamberth also addressed additional discovery issues, how the issue of general damages would be tried, and that the class would be decertified to try the issue of special damages.  278 F.R.D. 14 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\nAfter Judge Lamberth had decertified the special damages class, the plaintiffs had moved to stay the decertification order and to make the stay of decertification order retroactive to date of that order. On February 19, 2013, the District Court (Judge Lamberth) stayed the decertification order was appropriate, but only as of when the plaintiffs’ moved for the stay. Leading up to the trial, both parties filed various motions regarding discovery and evidence that the court addressed. \n\nIn March 2013, there was a week-long jury trial. Afterward, the District moved for judgment as a matter of law, which was denied. But on March 11, the jury found that the plaintiffs were unconstitutionally overdetained at the D.C. Jail between 2007 and 2008, but that the District wasn't liable; the jury didn't find evidence of \"deliberate indifference\" to the inmates' rights. Because Judge Lamberth had already granted the plaintiffs summary judgment on claims related to the strip searches and on the city's liability for overdetentions from 2005 to 2006, the parties moved for the case to be referred to mediation and the litigation stayed. \n\nOn November 4, 2013, the parties reached a settlement agreement, which the Court approved on March 18, 2014. The District agreed to provide monetary compensation for each plaintiff, based on the length of time they were \"overdetained\" and for qualifying strip searches. The District also agreed to pay a total of $6.2 million to the plaintiffs, the class members, and to cover costs and attorney's fees. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the agreement. \n\nAs of February 2016, the District had filed two status reports with the court on the payments to the plaintiffs.

{"document": "On December 2, 2002, nine female plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, filed this 42 U.S.C §1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  The plaintiffs challenged the practice of the U.S. Marshal's Service and the District of Columbia of conducting blanket strip, visual body cavity, and/or squat searches (\"strip searches\") of female arrestees that were being held in the Superior Court Cell Block of the D.C. Superior Court while awaiting presentment before a judicial officer.  Specifically, the plaintiffs complained that the policy and practice of subjecting all female arrestees to strip searches in the absence of reasonable individualized suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment.  The plaintiffs further complained that the practice of subjecting female arrestees but not similarly situated male arrestees to blanket strip searches violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.  The class action complaint was amended twice in 2006.\n\nDefendants denied all allegations and, on May 31, 2006, sought dismissal of the case on numerous grounds, including the defense of qualified immunity.  On November 14, 2006, the District Court (Judge Rosemary M. Collyer) denied Defendants' motion to dismiss in its entirety.  Johnson v. District of Columbia, 461 F.Supp.2d 48 (D.D.C. 2006).  Defendants initially appealed, but the appeal was subsequently voluntarily dismissed.  Johnson v. Government of District of Columbia, 2007 WL 1760078 (D.C.Cir. Jun 11, 2007).\n\nOn February 8, 2008, the District Court granted the plaintiff's motions for class certification. The Court designated two groups of classes, the Fifth Amendment Class and the Fourth Amendment Class. \n\nThe court defined the Fourth Amendment Class as, \"Each woman who, during the Class Period (December 2, 1999, until April 25, 2003), was, (i) held in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) awaiting presentment under a statute of the District of Columbia; (iii) subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search; (iv) under similar circumstances for which male arrestees were not subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search.\"\n\nThe court defined the Fifth Amendment Class as, \"each woman who, during the Class Period (December 2, 1999, until April 25, 2003), was, (i) held in the Superior Court Cell Block; (ii) awaiting presentment under a statute of the District of Columbia on either (a) a non-drug, non-violent traffic offense, (b) a non-drug, non- violent misdemeanor, or (c) a non-drug, non-violent felony; and (iii) subjected to a blanket strip, visual body cavity and/or squat search; (iv) without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that she was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband.\" \n\nIn this opinion, the District Court also dismissed all charges against the United States Marshall's Service. \n\nOn February 28, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a cross-claim against United States Superior Court Marshall Todd Dillard on the grounds that he caused them (separately and concurrently) to be subjected strip searches at the D.C. Superior Court cellblock in violation of the 4th and 5th amendments. And that by instituting and implementing a policy which subjected the plaintiffs, all women, to strip searches without individualized suspicion, the co-defendant is liable to the District for all, or part of the claims asserted by the plaintiff against the District of Columbia in this action, by virtue of his practice and policy. This crossclaim was partially in response to the District Court having previously dismissed the plaintiff's claims against the United States Marshall's Service.\n\nOn May 23, 2008, the District of Columbia filed for summary judgment for the charges against the District of Columbia. The District Court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on October 31, 2008. The Court found that the District of Columbia cannot be liable to the plaintiffs as a matter of law on any of the theories they advance inasmuch as the Marshal was a federal official and not an employee, servant, agent or actor under the control of the District of Columbia, and inasmuch as the District of Columbia had no choice but to turn over arrestees to the Superior Court Marshal for presentment. This dismissal left the Marshall (Todd Dillard) as the sole defendant in this case.\n\nOn January 14, 2010, the District Court denied the plaintiff's motion to amend their complaint for the third time.\n\nOn April 5, 2010, the defendant filed for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' remaining claims against the Marshall.\n\nOn April 21, 2011, the District Court issued an opinion that granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Court conceded that the record shows that during the class period female arrestees were subjected to a blanket practice of strip searches while many, if not most, male arrestees were not. It is nonetheless clear that former Marshal Dillard is entitled to qualified immunity from the Fourth Amendment claims. The Fifth Amendment claims similarly fail as the plaintiffs proffered no evidence that former Marshal Dillard purposefully discriminated by intending a gender disparity in search procedures. Summary judgment was denied to the plaintiffs on their Fourth Amendment claims and granted to Marshal Dillard on the Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims. Accordingly the case was dismissed from District Court. \n\nOn May 4, 2011, the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the DC Circuit Court. \n\nOn August 13, 2014 the DC Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the District Court's summary judgment ruling for Superior Court Marshal, finding him entitled to qualified immunity. And also affirming the District Court's summary judgment ruling for the District of Columbia, concluding that because the Superior Court Marshal in charge of the cellblock was at all times a federal official acting under color of federal law, the city had no authority to prevent the strip searches.", "summary": "In 2002, nine female plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, filed this 42 U.S.C §1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

The plaintiff claimed that the officials at DC’s Correctional Treatment Facility denied him (1) effective access to qualified interpreters (2) effective access to telecommunications, (3) access to jail alerts and announcements, and (4) adequate access to visitation. This effectively prevented the plaintiff from communicating with staff and inmates inside the jail, and family and friends during visitation hours. The plaintiff sued the District of Columbia under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the plaintiff sought damages and attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that officers at the D.C. Correctional Treatment Facility denied him adequate accommodations from the moment he arrived. The plaintiff’s native language was American Sign Language. He had relied on interpreters and auxiliary aids when communicating with people who did not know American Sign Language. Although he could communicate via notes in written English, it was his second language and no substitute for the accommodations guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. Yet no interpreter was present for intake, orientation, or at any point during the plaintiff’s fifty-one day sentence. The lack of accommodation prevented the plaintiff from obtaining adequate health care, accessing the facility’s rehabilitative services, and communicating with visitors. During in person visits, the plaintiff wore handcuffs. The plaintiff analogized that this was equivalent to gagging a hearing prisoner. \n\nOn April 4, 2013 the case was reassigned to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Over a year later on August 2, 2014, Judge Jackson referred the case to a magistrate judge for mediation. But by October, the parties had not reached a settlement. The case proceeded through discovery.\n\nOn November 14, 2014 the plaintiff moved for summary judgment with respect to claim (1) that he had been denied access to an interpreter, and claim (2) that he had been denied effective telecommunication technology. On September 2, 2015, the judge granted the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment with respect to his claims that the facility had denied him adequate access to interpreters and telecommunications technology. 128 F.Supp.3d 250 (D.D.C. 2015). On September 29, 2015 the defendant filed a motion to reconsider the summary judgment the court had filed against them. Judge Brown denied this motion on November 25, 2015. 146 F.Supp.3d 197 (D.D.C. 2015).\n\nThe case then went to trial with respect to the plaintiff’s remaining Rehabilitation Act claims, and on May 11, 2016 the jury returned a judgment for the plaintiff and awarded $70,000 in damages. The city appealed. The District of Columbia sought and obtained an order to withhold attorneys' fees from the judgment until the appeal had been resolved. \n\nThe Defendant appealed on the following issues: the calculation of the plaintiff's damages, whether there was a duty to conduct disability assessment before admitting the plaintiff, whether there was a genuine issue of fact that the jail afforded the plaintiff an interpreter and on the plaintiffs non-interpreter claims, and whether the court erred in allowing opinions from the plaintiff's experts.

{"document": "On June 29, 2009, two inmates at the Manatee County Jail filed a pro se lawsuit in the Middle District Court of Florida challenging the constitutionality of the jail’s new mail policy. The inmates filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated at the jail, alleging that the new policy, which only allowed inmates to receive post-cards, was unconstitutional. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged that jail personnel were opening their privileged mail and were allowing trainees to search legal bins and legal mail without the owner being present, and that the defendants were violating their constitutional rights by allowing trainees to perform training exercises on them and other prisoners, including cavity searches. The plaintiffs asked the court for injunction and declaratory judgment claiming violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nOn July 8, 2009, the case was dismissed without prejudice, because the plaintiffs raised several unrelated claims in the same complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended pro se complaint on July 24, 2009, which only challenged the Manatee County Jail mail policy. The Court dismissed the amended complaint without prejudice because the plaintiffs were proceeding pro se and were purporting to bring a class action for themselves and all others similarly situated. \n\nOn September 4, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a pro se 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, alleging that the new mail policy at Manatee County Jail and the Defendants' practice of opening privileged mail and censoring the newspaper given to inmates violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. \n\nThe court appointed counsel to the Plaintiffs on October 26, 2009. Plaintiffs' counsel--the Florida Justice Institute and private counsel--filed an amended complaint on February 18, 2010, claiming that the new mail policy violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the inmates and the inmates family members and friends. The plaintiffs' group included two inmates and two family members of inmates. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief. \n\nOn April 15, 2010, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint. Later, on May 12, 2010, the defendants filed a motion to disqualify Judge Kovachevich for bias or prejudice. The defendants alleged that one of Judge Kovachevich's staff attorneys undertook a factual investigation regarding the plaintiffs' claim. Allegedly, the staff attorney contacted the jail and requested legal precedent regarding the defendants' mail policy. Additionally, the defendants claimed that the staff attorney made a sua sponte request for counsel to represent the plaintiffs.  \n\nOn May 28, 2010 Judge Elizabeth A. Kovachevich dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint. The court held that postcard only mail policies were reasonably related to penological interests and cited precedent from the Middle District of Florida. <i>Turner v. Safley</i>, 482 U.S. at 85, 107 S.Ct. 2254 (1987).\n\nOn June 23, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the case. Specifically the plaintiffs argued that the case should be reconsidered because the case was dismissed while there was a pending motion for the recusal of Judge Kovachevich. Furthermore, the court dismissed the case sua sponte before the defendants explained why their practices carried out a legitimate penological interest, nor were the plaintiffs allowed to present evidence to the contrary. \n\nOn March 11, 2011 the court issued an order to have both parties report on whether the case was moot before ruling on the plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration. The order stated that both inmates had been released from the jail and that any argument for granting injunctive relief on account that the plaintiffs might be future inmates was without merit. The plaintiffs’ counsel responded on March 25, 2011 and argued that the case was not moot because the plaintiffs still had standing to seek injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of the proposed class of persons similarly situated. On March 29, 2011 the defendants responded that the claims were moot because the plaintiffs were no longer inmates and thus no longer had a personal stake in the matter. \n\nWhat happened next is unclear. Two of the lawyers for the Florida Justice Institute filed motions to withdraw, because they were moving out of state. Both motions stated that other counsel would remain involved (both motions were granted). But there is no other recorded activity in the docket.

{"document": "On April 8, 1999, inmates at the Foster County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia, who had tested positive for HIV, filed this class action lawsuit against county officials.  The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Center for Human Rights, brought the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  They alleged that the defendants' policies, which denied even basic medical care to HIV-positive prisoners, were sufficient to meet the deliberate indifference standard required to show a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Plaintiffs alleged that the same practices also violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought improvements in medical care and a reduction in overcrowding.  \n\nOn April 16, 1999, the court (Judge Marvin H. Shoob) held a preliminary injunction hearing, at which the parties presented a proposed settlement.  The court entered a consent order as to the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief on the same day.\n\nSubsequently, on January 10, 2000, the parties filed a joint motion to provide notice of class action settlement.  On January 24, 2000, the court (Judge Shoob), after a hearing on the settlement, entered a final order and closed the case.  The defendants were required to improve medical care and reduce overcrowding in the jail. The final settlement agreement specifically required that the defendant provide timely medical access to all present and future HIV-positive inmates [the class], and treatment that met the standard of care set forth by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

The appointed health care monitor submitted a status report to the court on March 7, 2000, detailing areas in need of improvement at the jail.  On April 11, 2000, the court (Judge Shoob) entered an order adopting the recommendations of the report, including that the scope of the settlement agreement reached to intake processes and medical care for all inmates, and aspects of communicable diseases.  Furthermore, the agreement required the elimination of overcrowding at the jail.  Foster v. Fulton Co., No. 1:99-CV-900-MHS, 2000 WL 34016360 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 11, 2000).\n\nFor approximately the next two years, the monitors continued to submit status reports, and the defendants continued to adjust policies to comply with the court's orders.  \n\nOn November 5, 2001, the court directed the parties to respond to the monitor's report that ten areas were \"far from compliance\" with the settlement agreement.  On April 16, 2002, the court (Judge Shoob) issued an order finding the defendants in breach of the settlement agreement, and requiring them to employ a sufficient number of trained staff, to refer HIV-positive inmates to outside specialists in a timely manner, and to improve overall jail conditions, including overcrowding, security, and nutrition.  Foster v. Fulton Co., 223 F. Supp. 2d 1292 (N.D. Ga. 2002).\n\nOn July 12, 2002, the court (Judge Shoob) denied the defendants' motion to stay implementation of actions ordered in the April 12, 2002 opinion.  The court held that the defendants were required to develop a unified system for providing counsel and the opportunity to review their charges for detainees within 72 hours of arrest, and to develop a meaningful discharge plan for physically and mentally ill prisoners.  Foster v. Fulton Co., 223 F. Supp. 2d 1301 (N.D. Ga. 2002).  \n\nAccording to the PACER docket, on October 28, 2002, the court (Judge Shoob) withdrew portions of its orders issued on April 12, 2002, and on July 12, 2002, required the appointment of counsel to indigents charged with minor offenses and the provision of all purpose hearings in state court within 72 hours of arrest to combat overcrowding.\n\nOn November 13, 2002 the Court terminated the case, with the consent of all parties, after the county promised to continue outside monitoring of jail health care for 18 months.  The docket reflects no further entries regarding the litigation of this case.  In 2003 and 2005 the plaintiffs filed copies of the notice they posted in the jail detailing the terms of the settlement.

{"document": "On January 27, 2009, current and former detainees at the Cook County Jail (CCJ), in Chicago, filed this class action lawsuit against Cook County and the Sheriff of Cook County in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought certification of two sub-classes: \"all inmates housed at Cook County Department of Corrections on or after January 1, 2007, who have made a written request for dental care because of acute pain and who suffered prolonged and unnecessary pain because of lack of treatment\" and \"all persons presently confined at the Cook County Jail who are experiencing dental pain and who have waited more than seven days after making a written request for treatment of that pain without having been examined by a dentist.\" For the first class, the plaintiffs sought monetary relief. For the second class, the plaintiffs sought both monetary and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs alleged that the Jail's failure to provide adequate dental care constituted deliberate indifference to their medical needs in violation of their constitutional rights. The case was assigned to Judge Joan H. Lefkow.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, the judge certified the second class of plaintiffs while denying the first class's certification. 2010 WL 4791509. Other judges in the same district had denied class certification in similar circumstances, and defendants (and the court) cited principles of comity to support denial of certification in this case. The plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of this denial, citing recent Supreme Court case law. On August 17, 2011, the judge granted this motion and certified both sub-classes. 2011 WL 13136965. \n\nThe defendants then appealed the August 17 decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The sole issue on appeal was if a district court, when deciding a motion for class certification, should defer, based on the principles of comity, to a sister court's ruling of on a motion for certification of a similar case. On June 19, 2012, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's grant of class certification by holding that another federal district judge's rulings on class certification was not preclusive. 683 F.3d 373. \n\nOn December 22, 2014, the district court issued an opinion decertifying the injunctive class, rendering the plaintiff's request for a permanent injunction moot. 2014 WL 7330792. The court also modified the definition of the damages class, narrowing it in a way to be determined at a later date. The court noted that positive changes in the provision of dental services at CCJ had made it so that injunctive relief would be so vague as to be pointless or too detailed to be practical. The plaintiffs immediately appealed the decision to deny the injunction to the Court of Appeals and moved to sub-divide the class to address the issues perceived by the court. \n\nThe defendants also filed a motion for an interlocutory appeal of the decision not to decertify the damages class, but it was denied by the Seventh Circuit on February 25, 2015. On July 6, 2016, the Seventh Circuit denied the plaintiffs' appeal of the decertification and renewed request for injunctive relief. 828 F.3d 541.\n\nOn October 13, 2016, Judge Lefkow denied the plaintiff's motion to sub-divide the class and strongly suggested that settlement would be appropriate. 2016 WL 5939704. \n\nThen, after many months of negotiations, the parties reached a settlement agreement and moved for preliminary approval of the agreement on May 1, 2018. The agreement required that the defendant County establish a settlement fund in the amount of $5,563,000 to cover damages for class members associated with their dental care, incentive awards, fees and costs of counsel, resolution of three separate lawsuits, and administration of this settlement. The court was to retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the agreement.

{"document": "On December 19, 2014, individuals who were incarcerated in the Marion County correctional system filed this class-action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.  The plaintiffs sued the Marion County Sheriff and the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought money damages for a class of individuals who were incarcerated in the Marion County correctional system for unreasonable periods of time. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants violated their Fourth Amendment right to protection against unreasonable seizures and detentions and their Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. The plaintiffs also alleged the defendants incarcerated the plaintiffs for longer than legally authorized because the plaintiffs were detained after their release was ordered and/or after the legal authority for their detention had ceased. The case was assigned to Judge Richard L. Young.\n\nThe Marion County Sheriff's Department stated to multiple individuals that the sheriff had a period of seventy-two hours after a release order to process prisoners out of jail. The plaintiffs argued that this is an unreasonable period of time. Additionally, the Sheriff had a practice of re-arresting and re-imprisoning individuals who had been released on their own recognizance or had their charges vacated or dismissed, at which point the Sheriff no longer had any legal right to detain them. The plaintiffs claimed that these procedures constituted unreasonable seizures and detentions, deprivation of liberty without due process, false imprisonment, and negligence. The plaintiffs sought the creation of a common fund from which all class members could claim compensatory damages and attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nEarly in the litigation, the plaintiffs filed three separate amended complaints. The third amended complaint, filed on May 13, 2015, added three plaintiffs and factual allegations to accommodate the new plaintiffs.\n\nTwo days prior, on May 11, 2015, a non-party to this case filed a motion to transfer this case to the Indiana Supreme Court. The court denied this motion on October 14, 2015, reasoning that the moving party was not a party to this action nor could he be a member of the putative class because the class had not yet been certified. Furthermore, Judge Dinsmore noted that the court did not have the authority to transfer the case to the Indiana Supreme Court. (Two-and-half years later, on January 19, 2018, this non-party filed a notice of appeal of this decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed the appeal, however, noting that this pro se appellant had neither paid the $505.00 appellate fees nor filed a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis in the district court.)\n\nOn October 15, 2015, the plaintiffs moved for class certification of a general class and five subclasses. The general class consisted of \"all individuals who, from December 19, 2012 to the present, were held in confinement by the Marion County Sheriff after legal authority for those detentions ceased.\" The five subclasses were based on the reasons the Sheriff ceased to have authority. The reasons were that the defendants were: \"operating under a standard of seventy-two (72) hours to release prisoners who are ordered released\" (72-hour subclass); \"not accepting cash or surety bonds but instead outsourcing the payment and processing of these bonds to the Marion County Clerk\" (cash subclass); \"employing a computer system inadequate for the purposes intended with respect to the timely release of prisoners\" (computer system subclass); \"re-arresting and imprisoning individuals who are released on their own recognizance, found not guilty or acquitted, or who have had their criminal charges vacated or dismissed, and for whom the Sheriff no longer has any legal right to detain\" (wrongful arrest subclass); and, \"keeping inmates imprisoned who the courts have released to Community Corrections for electronic monitoring\" (Community Corrections subclass).\n\nOn September 30, 2016, the district court entered an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Judge Young granted the motion as to the wrongful arrest subclass and the Community Corrections subclass. The class was certified as:\n<blockquote>\"All individuals who, from December 19, 2012, to the present, were held in confinement by the Sheriff after legal authority for those detentions ceased due to the Sheriff’s policies or practices of: (1) re-arresting and imprisoning individuals who are released on their own recognizance, found not guilty or acquitted, or who have had their criminal charges vacated or dismissed; and (2) keeping inmates imprisoned who the courts have released to Community Corrections for electronic monitoring.\"</blockquote>\nThe court denied the motion as to the 72-hour subclass, the cash subclass, and the computer system subclass. Dissatisfied with this order, the plaintiffs appealed the district court's denial as to the 72-hour and computer system subclasses. 2016 WL 5946839. Subsequently, on November 2, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion to stay case proceedings pending resolution of this appeal. \n\nOn December 5, 2016, Judge Dinsmore filed a report and recommendation regarding the plaintiffs' motion to stay, recommending that the court grant the motion. Agreeing with Judge Dinsmore, Judge Young adopted the report and granted the motion.\n\nOn June 15, 2017, the Seventh Circuit issued an opinion vacating the district court's decision and remanding the case. In this opinion, the appeals court found the district court's reasoning for denying the computer system subclass to be without base. Moreover, the Seventh Circuit noted that the district court erred in relying on a 48-hour presumption of reasonableness with regard to detention as a basis for denying certification of the 72-hour subclass. 859 F.3d 489. Given this opinion, the plaintiffs moved to amend the class certification order on July 10, 2017, asking the district court to certify the computer system subclass and modify its 48-hour presumption to a 6-hour presumption. In response, on September 19, 2017, arguing that the Seventh Circuit's opinion did not order the district court to certify the two subclasses, the defendants filed a motion to set a class certification hearing to resolve factual disputes. \n\nAgreeing with the defendants, the district court granted the defendants' motion for hearing and denied the plaintiffs' motion on December 14, 2017. The hearing was originally set for February 16, 2018, but was later rescheduled and held on October 8, 2018. The court certified the class of plaintiffs on November 5, 2019 with respect to the following classes: 1) the Sheriff's practice of operating under a standard allowing up to 72 hours to release prisoners who are ordered released; and 2) the Sheriff's practice of employing a computer system inadequate for the purposes intended with respect to the timely release of prisoners.\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Indianapolis and Marion County moved for summary judgment. That same day, several of the named defendants also filed for partial summary judgment.

{"document": "Built in 1991, the Campbell County Detention Center was designed to hold 135 prisoners. It quickly became overcrowded. In the weeks before this lawsuit was filed in the district court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, on April 29, 2005, the jail's population reached a high of 276 prisoners, many of whom were forced to sleep on the floor.  Many of the inmates were awaiting transfer to the Kentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC), which was also named as a defendant in this lawsuit.  The KDOC addressed overcrowding at the jail by simply reducing the required floor space for each prisoner from 50 to 40 square feet. This lawsuit, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by attorney Robert B. Newman of the Cincinnati, Ohio, law firm Newman & Meeks, alleged the overcrowding violated the prisoners' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

The Court (Judge William O. Bertelsman) approved the settlement, after allowing one class member to opt-out, signing the consent decree on February 7, 2006.  \n\nTo settle the suit, County officials and the KDOC agreed to a number of measures aimed at reducing overcrowding. These included the building of a new Restricted Custody Center to house felons headed for the KDOC, expansion and remodeling of the old jail, and the implementation of new policies to prevent overcrowding. \n\nAt the detention center, County officials agreed to add 256 beds, as well as a new kitchen and laundry facility, and to convert the old kitchen and laundry space into an upgraded infirmary. A full time nurse position was also created and filled.  The jail also agreed to install more bunk beds and renovate dormitory showers; replace a boiler and all air conditioning units; upgrade the security system; and replace a leaky roof. \n\nIn addition, the County agreed to decline regular requests to house federal prisoners, and the KDOC agreed to remove prisoners from the detention center within 45 days or sooner after the imposition of a prison sentence. The county reached an agreement with Boone County to house up to 30 prisoners at Boone County's new jail if necessary. County officials agreed to appoint a \"Population/Pretrial Officer\" responsible for managing the number of prisoners at the detention center; implement a \"Pretrial Conditional Release Program\" to reduce the number of prisoners housed at the detention center; and initiate an objective jail classification system. Finally, a Criminal Justice Advisory Council (CJAC) was to be be created and maintained to foster communication between judges, defense attorneys, and probation and parole officers in order to address issues that might reduce jail population. As an element of the CJAC, Campbell County police chiefs agreed to instruct their officers to simply ticket and release misdemeanor offenders (except those charged with domestic violence or driving under the influence) who are not a threat to public safety or a flight risk.\n\nOn April 14, the Court required that status reports be filed every six months.

Judge Xinis also directed the parties to submit a joint recommendation for an Independent Inspector by April 27, or two recommendations each, with supporting documents, if they were unable to agree. \n\nThe defendant filed their response in opposition to plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order on April 25 under seal.

By letter dated March 6, 2003, the DOJ advised Santa Fe County of minimal remedial measures it should implement in order to remedy unconstitutional practices relating to: (1) medical and mental health care; (2) suicide prevention; (3) protection of inmates from harm; (4) fire safety; (5) sanitation; and (6) inmate grievance procedures (including court access).\n\nSanta Fe County agreed to make the recommended reforms.

{"document": "On June 16, 2008, people with mental disabilities who had been arrested and detained in the Doña Ana County Detention Center (“DACDC”) brought this class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico. The plaintiffs sued the Board of County Commissioners for the County of Doña Ana, the DACDC, and law enforcement. The Plaintiffs, represented by the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and private counsel, sought sought class-wide preliminary and permanent injunctive relief for violations of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the New Mexico Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and  the Rehabilitation Act. Additionally, the named Plaintiffs sought damages for the violations of their rights and for the negligent acts and omissions that gave rise to tort claims.\n\nThere were two groups of Defendants: County Commissioners and Law Enforcement, in this matter. The first group of Defendants encompassed the Board of County Commissioners for the County of Doña Ana, which was responsible for all county operations including the Doña Ana County Detention Center. The second group of Defendants was comprised of two subgroups of law enforcement, City of Las Cruces Police Department and Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Office. \n\nSpecifically, the Plaintiffs alleged that at least thirty percent of DACDC’s approximately nine hundred detainees had mental disabilities. According to the Plaintiffs, the DACDC Defendants had continually and persistently ignored the mental health needs of detainees, and had failed to provide them with constitutionally adequate mental health services. The Defendants never instituted an effective system for making routine assessments of detainees with symptoms of mental illness. Nor did the Defendants implement an effective system for tracking detainees who needed mental health care. The DACDC Defendants failed to provide regular monitoring of detainees’ mental health care needs, and failed to provide the treatment they need.\n\nAs stated in the Plaintiffs’ complaint, failure in treatment led the Defendants to rely too heavily on the use of segregation for detainees with mental health care needs. A significant number of detainees in the segregation units exhibited obvious symptoms of serious mental illness. Notwithstanding isolation’s particularly harmful effects on the mental health of detainees, the Defendants failed to conduct regular medical rounds and assessments of their needs. The Defendants also failed to engage in meaningful discharge planning for detainees with mental disabilities. The Defendants discharged detainees without access to the medications they may have been taking in jail, without referrals to community mental health programs, and without any other essential discharge planning services needed to manage their mental illnesses. The predictable result was recidivism and a cycle of arrests and detentions. \nThe Law Enforcement Defendants were aware of the DACDC Defendants’ failure to meet the serious mental healthcare needs of detainees. Nevertheless, according to the Plaintiffs, the Law Enforcement Defendants persisted in a discriminatory pattern and practice of arresting persons with mental disabilities and transporting them to DACDC, instead of taking them to appropriate community based services or otherwise diverting them from the criminal justice system. Additionally, the Law Enforcement Defendants’ failed to effectively train law enforcement personnel to recognize the signs of mental disabilities and respond appropriately.\n\nOn January 3, 2008 the Plaintiffs entered an amended complaint for Class Action injunctive relief and damages. On the same day the Defendants moved to remove the case to federal court. The Plaintiffs submitted multiple amended complaints, and the Defendants sought to dismiss the claims based on the U.S. Constitution and the New Mexico Constitution as well as the class action claims. \n\nIn August 2008, the parties began engaging in settlement conversations.\n\nAs these conversations continued, on May 2, 2009, the Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Defendants from continuing to subject the Plaintiffs and other people with mental disabilities to the actions and inactions set forth in the complaint. The injunction was denied on November 20, 2009 at the recommendation of Magistrate Judge Gregory B. Wormuth because public policy weighed against doing so without clarity of facts regarding key allegations. \n\nOn July 2, 2009, Judge William P. Johnson affirmed Magistrate Judge Karen B. Molzen’s Report and Recommendation to sanction  the County Defendants for failure to report their change of position regarding settlement talks after a year and a half of attempted settlement discussions. Specifically, the County Manager, who had engaged in settlement conversations, failed to inform the Plaintiffs that the Board of Commissioners had rejected the new direction of the talks. The Court ordered that the County Defendants to pay sanctions to Plaintiffs in the amount of $7,394.00.\n\nOn July 9, 2009, the Plaintiffs dismissed with prejudice their claims against the City Defendants, since the Plaintiffs and the City Defendants had reached a settlement in the case. Six months later, on December 15, 2009, the case was settled with the County Defendants before Judge William P. Johnson. The settlement, found on the <a href=http://www.bazelon.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bravosettlement9-09.pdf”>Bazelon Center website</a>,   called for expanded training, new policies and procedures, increased resources to divert people with mental illnesses from the criminal justice system. It also included a monetary payment totalling $150,000 as damages for the named plaintiffs and attorneys fees. It included no payment to class members. . \n\nOn January 15, 2010 the Plaintiffs dismissed with prejudice (closing the case) the matter against the County Defendants.\n", "summary": "This class action was brought on behalf of people with mental disabilities arrested and detained in the Doña Ana County Detention Center (“DACDC”), to redress violations of their constitutional rights, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act.

Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked for compensatory and punitive damages, alleging she was falsely arrested, police used excessive force when arresting her, that she was strip-searched in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that Defendants committed battery.  Plaintiff alleged claims against her cousin for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and intentional infliction of emotional distress because Plaintiff was arrested after her cousin filed a complaint against her.\n\nOn January 21, 1997, Defendant Detective arrested Plaintiff for a misdemeanor.  Plaintiff alleged Defendant used excessive force by bruising her arm when the Detective handcuffed her.  Plaintiff was subjected to a strip and body cavity search at Central Booking by two female Corrections Department employees, in accordance with a City policy of strip-searching all arrestees, and without any reasonable suspicion.  Plaintiff was released on her own recognizance the following day and the charges against her were eventually dropped.  Plaintiff was traumatized and humiliated, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, entered therapy, and took antidepressants.\n\nOn July 17, 1998, Defendants offered Plaintiff $25,001 plus reasonable attorney's fees accrued up to that date.  Plaintiff did not accept the settlement offer.\n\nOn April 26, 1999, Plaintiff settled her claims against her cousin for $2,500.\n\nOn May 7, 1999, the United States District Court (Judge Robert P. Patterson, Jr.) awarded plaintiff $19,645 in compensatory damages and $5,000,000 in punitive damages against the city according to a jury verdict following a three day jury trial.  The Court granted a directed verdict for Plaintiff regarding the strip-search.  The Court found that Defendant's strip-search policy violated the Fourth Amendment and there was no evidence the officers believed Plaintiff concealed contraband.

The Court held that Plaintiff was liable for Defendants' costs from the date of their offer because their offer was more than her jury award.  Plaintiff was awarded attorney's fees and costs incurred prior to July 17, 1998, a total of $419,116.45.  Defendants were granted $8,038.40.  Ciraolo v.

The plaintiffs sued the Sheriff of Delaware County under 42 U.S.C § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought monetary relief for severe emotional distress, psychological damage, and significant pain and suffering, personal humiliation, and degradation. The plaintiffs claimed that the Sheriff failed to properly train, supervise, or control deputies and jailers while they were in charge of female inmates. They alleged that the jailers' negligence and misconduct deprived them of rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments’ due process and equal protection clauses.

She alleged that the City of Philadelphia of had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all pre-trial detainees remanded to the custody of the Philadelphia Prison System, regardless of criminal charge or reasonable suspicion.  Plaintiff alleged that the policy required all arrestees to disrobe in front of a corrections officer, who then conducted visual inspection of the genitals and body cavities, using a flashlight to illuminate body cavities.

{"document": "On March 15, 2012, a group of juvenile prisoners in Central County Jail in Polk County filed a lawsuit in the Middle District of Florida under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Though plaintiffs amended their complaint twice to include different defendants, the lawsuit proceeded against the Sheriff of Polk County and Corizon Health, Inc., the health care provider retained by the Sheriff to provide medical services for the prisoners. The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, asked the court for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, claiming that the youths' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. The plaintiffs also requested class certification. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs claimed that, as juveniles, they were housed in an adult correctional facility. The plaintiffs claimed they were left unattended for long periods of time, and punished regularly with chemical agents, isolation and lockdown. The plaintiffs were forced to eat in their cells, and clean their own toilets with the soap provided for personal hygiene. The plaintiffs claimed a complete lack of rehabilitative services and extremely poor educational services. \n\nOn May 4, 2012, the Court (Judge Steven D. Merryday) granted the motion to dismiss for two named individual defendants, but denied the overall motion to dismiss the case. On August 13, 2012, the Court issued an order stating that K.G. (the representative of the sub-class of juvenile prisoners needing mental health treatment), as a pre-trial detainee, could only represent other pre-trial detainees, and therefore K.G., and the resulting subclass could not sue under the Eighth Amendment. However, Judge Merryday once again denied the overall motion to dismiss the case.\n\nOn November 19, 2012, the complaint was amended to include lack of adequate medical care. The plaintiffs alleged that medication was not provided to juveniles with serious mental and psychiatric problems, or that the medication was given irregularly and not in the way prescribed. The plaintiffs further alleged that no medical or counseling services were offered to children professing suicidal ideations. Instead, such children were put on \"suicide watch.\" \"Suicide watch\" consists of placing the child in a open cage, with only a hard bench along one side. The children would be left there for at least 23 hours, but often for days.  \"Suicide watch\" was also given to children punitively.  Children also had to strip publicly and put on a 'turtle' suit, which left them vulnerable to the chemical agents, which continued to be used against children on \"suicide watch.\" \n\nOn April 30, 2013, the Court granted class certification and denied the requested preliminary injunction. The first subclass was defined as: \"each person who is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court (that is, including preadjudicates and excluding direct files) and who is now or in the future incarcerated in the Polk County Jail.\" \n\nA Second sub-class was compromised as each person: \"(1) who is now or in the future incarcerated in the Polk County Jail, (2) who is under eighteen or under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, and (3) who suffers from a 'mental disorder.' \" With a person who suffers from a mental disorder defined as: \"diagnosed by a mental health care professional, qualified in Florida both to diagnose mental disorders and to prescribe psychotropic medication, and who is suffering from a 'moderate' or 'severe' 'mental disorder,' as defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and (2) whose current diagnosis, including any prescription for psychotropic medication, appears in the person’s 'intake' records presented to the Polk County Jail at the time the person is presented to, and accepted by, the Polk County Jail for detention.\"\n\nOn June 12, 2013, Judge Merryday denied defendants' motions for summary judgment, and the parties proceeded to a bench trial, which ran from November 18, 2013 to December 18, 2013. At its close, Judge Merryday ordered both parties to submit proposed finding of facts and conclusions from both the plaintiff and the defendant. \n\nOn April 16, 2015, Judge Merryday issued an opinion denying relief to the plaintiffs, holding that the plaintiffs failed to prove that either the Sheriff or Corizon demonstrated deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to the plaintiffs and that plaintiffs failed to show that defendants' policies and customs violated their constitutional rights.

The plaintiffs alleged that through policy and practice, the DJJ subjected children to solitary confinement, often repeatedly and without any time limit. The plaintiffs cited scientific material that discusses the side effects of isolation: trauma, depression, anxiety, an increased risk of suicide and self-harm, and permanent interference with development. The plaintiffs also alleged that the DJJ failed to provide mental health exams prior to confinement and failed to provide meaningful mental health services during confinement to prevent the onset or exacerbation of mental illness. The plaintiffs brought claims of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

{"document": "On May 16, 2008, the Attorney General, on behalf of the United States, filed suit against the state of Ohio, its governor, the director of youth services, and the superintendents of its juvenile correctional facilities pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141 for an alleged pattern or practice of violating the rights of juvenile detainees under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1482, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n\nThe United States alleged that Ohio failed to protect the youth at its facilities from harm and undue risk of harm, failed to meet their medical and mental health needs, and failed to provide adequate special education services. The alleged harm and undue risk included unwarranted use of force and seclusion, and inadequate grievance and investigation procedures, while the alleged inadequacies of the health and education services were more total and included lack of dental care, and inadequate intake, screening, and treatment. \n\nThe facilities sued were Circleville Youth Center, Cuyahoga Hills Boys School, Indian River School, Marion Juvenile Correctional Center, Mohican Youth Center, Ohio River Valley Youth Center, Scioto Juvenile Correctional Center, and the Freedom Center. The suit was filed as a result of Department of Justice (DOJ) investigations into the conditions of confinement at the Scioto and Marion centers that began in 2005.\n\nOn June 12, 2008 in accordance with a joint motion of the parties, the court (Judge Algenon L. Marbley) ordered the entry of a stipulation to injunctive relief for the Scioto and Marion centers and conditionally dismissed the claims against the other facilities. The other facilities were already under a stipulated injunction from the related case <i>S.H. v. Stickrath</i>, linked below (Clearinghouse code: JI-OH-0004), so the claims were dismissed on the condition that the United States have access to all relevant Ohio Department of Youth Services (ODYS) policies and the monitor from the <i>Stickrath</i>. The Independent Fact Finder's 214-page <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/JI-OH-0004-0003.pdf\"> report</a> from that case contains useful background for the issues in this case. The Court entered the Stipulation for Injunctive Relief on June 24, 2008.\n\nThe injunction required Ohio to develop a wide variety of policies, procedures and practices to remedy the undue harm, inadequate medical and mental health care access, and inadequate special education services to which it subjected the juveniles detained in its facilities. In addition, the injunction appointed a monitor, Fred Cohen, to conduct investigations and report periodically on the state's compliance and required the state to train its employees, develop any additional documents or forms necessary to comply with the injunction, and to create and collect data to assess its performance. The terms of the injunction also guaranteed the Department of Justice access to the youth and staff at the Scioto and Marion centers and to all relevant records. Ohio had one year to revise its policies, training materials, and assessment tools so as to comply with the injunction, which was to last for three years or terminate early upon a showing of a year of substantial compliance.\n\nMonitor Fred Cohen, who had acted as the monitor for both the <i>S.H.</i> case and this case, resigned from monitoring duties only for this case on September 24, 2009. On December 15, 2009, the Court approved modification of the stipulation to provide a new monitoring scheme in which the DOJ acted as monitor through a team of experts. The modification also recognized that the injunction ceased to apply to the Marion facility, which had been closed.\n\nOn February 26, 2010, the court ordered ODYS to develop a new meal policy that would ensure that it fed the juveniles committed to the facilities. ODYS had promulgated a protocol that said that youth who refused to go to the cafeteria would not receive a meal. It was applied inconsistently and appeared to deny food to those who refused out of fear. The issue led to a show cause hearing because of discrepancies in the summaries and data provided to the court and to a subsequent order to submit a new policy.\n\nBy the consent of the parties, the court amended the injunction on June 6, 2011, to remove many provisions. The monitoring section was redone, and the DOJ relinquished that role to a team of experts. Most notable was that the 3-year expiration clause was removed, making the injunction terminable only on a showing of substantial compliance for two reporting periods. The court adopted a revised version of the injunction that reflected the two amendments in a single document on June 28, 2011.\n\nOn January 18, 2013, as a result of problems with the Progress Unit indicated in the Monitor's Third Report, the parties entered into a consent order that laid out a series of requirements meant to ensure that youth on the Progress Unit are not subjected excessive seclusion, that they receive structured programming, that they be screened to ensure they were not sent to the unit for symptoms of mental illness, and that they be given treatment plans that include reasonable goals designed to enable them to leave the unit. The order would be terminated only upon a showing of substantial compliance for six months.\n\nThe Monitor's Fourth Report and the First Status Report on Progress Unit were completed in 2013 and included an evaluation of the Scioto Facility. Both reports stated that Ohio was not in substantial compliance with the respective injunctions. \n\nAs a result of the State's inability to comply with the consent order, on March 12, 2014 the Department of Justice moved to supplement its original complaint by also including the state's use of unlawful seclusion at all of its juvenile correctional facilities. The court approved this motion on March 28, 2014 and DOJ filed a supplemental complaint on March 31, 2014. At the time that DOJ filed its supplemental complaint, it also sought a temporary restraining order to stem the state's seclusion of juveniles with mental health disorders.\n\nThe Department of Justice announced a final agreement with the State of Ohio on Wednesday, May 21, 2014. While Ohio was working to eventually eliminate disciplinary seclusion of youth, this agreement included interim measures that would taken to ensure that seclusion only occurred under certain conditions and for a limited duration. The state also agreed to reduce the potential harms caused by seclusion by increasing access to therapeutic, educational and recreational services while a young person is in seclusion.\n\nOn Feb. 11, 2015, the monitoring Correctional Institution Inspection Committee, issued a <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/JI-OH-0006-0022.pdf\">report</a> showing a dramatic decline in use of seclusion.  \n\nThe court-appointed monitors submitted final reports in 2015, establishing that the defendant had achieved substantial compliance with the agreement's provisions. The report on the DYS facilities for boys was submitted June 10, 2015, and the report on the DYS-contracted facilities for girls was submitted on November 30, 2015. The monitors submitted their final status report, \"The Ohio Model: A Report on the Transformational Reform of the Ohio Department of Youth Services, 2007-2015,\" on December 7, 2015. The report documented improvements including recording and review of uses of force; a meaningful grievance system; abolition of disciplinary seclusion and dramatic reductions in pre-hearing seclusion; educational programming; increased family visitation; improved mental health treatment; and reduction of the incarcerated population. \n\nOn December 3, 2015, the parties made a joint motion to terminate the consent decree. The consent decree was terminated on December 9, 2015, and the case is now closed.\n", "summary": "The Attorney General filed suit against the state of Ohio, its governor, the director of youth services, and the superintendents of its juvenile correctional facilities pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141 for an alleged pattern or practice of violating the rights of juvenile detainees under the 14th Amendment, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

The County and individual County officials denied the allegations and argued that the individual officials were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nOn March 20, 2002, the District Court (Judge Lawrence L.

{"document": "On May 7, 2004, individuals in the custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) filed a civil rights suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, challenging the conditions of their confinement at the Florida Civil Commitment Center (FCCC) in Arcadia, Florida.  Plaintiffs were all involuntarily civilly confined at the FCCC pursuant to Sexually Violent Predator Act §§ 394.910, et seq. Fla. Stat. (2003).  Plaintiffs alleged violations of their constitutional rights, specifically their 14th Amendment rights, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et. seq. (ADA) by the denial of effective sex offender treatment programs, lack of appropriate mental health care, and the failure to identify and accommodate inmates with disabilities in a way that would allow them to participate effectively in sex-offender treatment.  Attorneys for the Southern Legal Counsel, Inc., the Florida Institutional Legal Services, Inc. and the Legal Advocacy Center of Central Florida, Inc. represented plaintiffs.  \n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.  Defendants named in the Complaint were the DCF and the private corporation Liberty Behavioral Healthcare Corp. which operated the FCCC pursuant to a contract with the DCF.\n\nDiscovery and discovery related disputes comprised the majority of the case activity for the next several years.\n\nOn January 16, 2007, the District Court (Judge John E. Steele) granted Liberty's motion to be dismissed as a defendant, on the grounds that Liberty no longer operated the FCCC and that the plaintiff class sought declaratory and injunctive relief, but not money damages. Plaintiffs moved to join GEO Group, Inc., the company contracted to run the facility for a five-year term beginning on January 1, 2007, as a defendant. This motion was granted, but because of likely delays that would have resulted from GEO's participation as a party, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed GEO on June 4, 2007. The case continued against DCF.\n\nDiscovery disputes and failed attempts by other inmates to join the case as intervening plaintiffs dominated the case docket for the next two and a half years.

The case settled on November 23, 2009, and the case was dismissed with prejudice.\n\nThe settlement established a Final Action Plan, which itself was not, the parties agreed, a judicially enforceable settlement or court issued injunction. The Plan called for improvements to the oversight and staffing of the inpatient mental health unit, the implementation of policies addressing the screening and referral process for the use of anti-androgens, comprehensive discharge planning for Phase IV residents, modifications to the special needs treatment track, and additional training for clinical staff and housing staff. The Final Action Plan also acknowledged significant improvements implemented by DCF and GEO during the pendency of the case.

The Final Action Plan was scheduled to be fully implemented by February 2010.\n\nThe defendants agreed to pay $249,000 in fees and costs to the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n\nSeveral class members objected to the settlement. They argued, inter alia, that the settlement should have required a federal monitor or court oversight to ensure compliance.

The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Represented by private counsel and the ACLU, they sought a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, and the right of all class members to bring subsequent individual lawsuits for damages.  \n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the state failed to provide adequate and meaningful health treatment to the plaintiffs and those similarly situated; the treatment and care that was given was, they alleged, punitive and constitutionally inadequate.  Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had failed to properly train their staff, provide individualized treatment programs, allow for family participation in rehabilitation efforts, allow for fair grievance procedures, afford reasonable opportunities to residents for activities, and to institute a procedure to guarantee appropriate therapist/patient confidentiality.  The defendants also allegedly required, as a precondition to participation in all but the most basic treatment, that plaintiffs admit to many crimes for which they were not convicted.  The conditions of confinement, according to the plaintiffs, were also unreasonable restrictive.  Examples included routine strip searches, routine shackling with restraints used in “super-max” prisons, intrusive and frequent cell searches, constant surveillance and in general having their freedom of movement restricted in a variety of arbitrary ways.\n\nOn March 19, 2002, this case was reassigned from Judge Matthew F.

The plaintiffs, represented by public interest attorneys, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that, despite their being found not guilty by reason of insanity of criminal offenses, they were still being incarcerated in Louisiana prisons. The named plaintiffs claimed that their continued imprisonment violated their Fourteenth Amendment right under the Due Process Clause, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504). \n\nThe named plaintiffs were all found not guilty by reason of insanity during their criminal trials and they were all committed by the courts to the Eastern Louisiana Mental Health System (ELMHS), which runs a state mental health facility. Nevertheless, at the time of the complaint, all named plaintiffs still remained incarcerated in state prisons, despite the fact that no other criminal charges had been filed against them. Plaintiffs claim that by continuing to incarcerate them, the state is discriminating against them on the basis of their mental illness and denying them appropriate mental health services. \n \nAfter the plaintiffs filed an amended class-action complaint, the Judge Shelly Dick granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. 2014 WL 7334911.

{"document": "On October 31, 2001, the Center for Public Representation, the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, and a private law firm filed a class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1396, against the Governor of Massachusetts and other state officials, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Rosie D. and eight other Medicaid-eligible children, aged 6 to 15, who were hospitalized or at risk of hospitalization due to a lack of home-based services. The class they sought to represent included tens of thousands of children in Massachusetts who were eligible for Medicaid (MassHealth) and had emotional, behavioral, or psychiatric disabilities. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had failed to provide medically necessary services as required under the federal Medicaid Act, and that it had failed to inform parents and children that they were entitled to these covered services. \n\nOn December 19, 2001, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On March 29, 2002, the district court (Judge Michael A. Ponsor) denied the motion to dismiss and certified the case as a class action. The defendants appealed the denial of their motion to dismiss. On November 7, 2002, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected the defendants’ appeal, holding that children had an enforceable right under the Medicaid Act to medically necessary treatment. 310 F.3d 230.\n\nThe district court issued an order compelling the defendants to produce requested documents for the plaintiffs on April 14, 2003. 256 F. Supp. 2d 115.\n\nOn December 16, 2004, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On March 25, 2005, the district court denied the motion for summary judgment, and the case headed for trial.\n\nThe case went through a six-week trial in the spring of 2005. On January 26, 2006, the court issued a 98-page decision that found that Massachusetts had violated the EPSDT provisions of the federal Medicaid Act (requirements for “Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment” services) by failing to provide home-based services to thousands of children across the state. 410 F. Supp. 2d 18. The result of this failure was that thousands of Massachusetts children with serious emotional disturbance were forced to endure unnecessary confinement in residential facilities or to remain in costly institutions far longer than their medical conditions required. \n\nAs a result of the judgment, the parties entered into negotiations to create a remedial plan. After six months of negotiations that failed to produce agreement, both sides presented separate plans to the court. On February 22, 2007, the court approved a modified version of the defendants’ plan. 474 F. Supp. 2d 238. The court’s adopted plan sought to restructure the children's mental health system by incorporating intensive home-based services, including behavioral health screenings, assessments, case management, crisis intervention, and in-home therapeutic supports. The plan’s strict timelines required full implementation by June 2009. The court also appointed a monitor to oversee the implementation, to mediate disputes between the parties, and to determine compliance with the court’s order.\n\nOn January 16, 2009, the defendants filed a motion to modify the judgment and to give them until July 1, 2010 to implement the plan. On February 27, 2009, the district court granted some extra time to the defendants, allowing them until December 1, 2009, to fully implement the remedial plan.\n\nBoth parties submitted periodical implementation reports on the remedial plan. On November 29, 2011, the court partially granted the plaintiffs’ motion to insure timely access to remedial services. The court ordered the defendants to propose a new plan for standards governing enrollment in Intensive Care Coordination, and a new timetable for implementation of these standards. The court also ordered that the defendants must appear before it every 60 days to report on their compliance progress.\n\nOver the next few years, both parties continued to submit status reports, and the court proceeded to extend the monitor’s role in six-month increments and endorsed the parties’ agreement regarding the monitor’s budget. \n\nOn February 7, 2019, the court denied the defendants’ motion to terminate monitoring. It noted that despite “persistent prodding from the court, Defendants are still grossly failing” to bring themselves into compliance with the remedial plan. Specifically, the defendants had failed to demonstrate they could provide “reasonably prompt” care to a substantial portion of the plaintiffs, which was defined as offering an initial appointment within fourteen days after initial contact. Citing this, and the defendants’ apparent lack of effort at compliance, the court retained its power to continue its supervision. \n\nThe defendants appealed this decision to the First Circuit on March 11, 2019. On March 13, the court denied the plaintiffs’ two outstanding motions, “in light of the general rule that…the filing of an appeal deprives a district court of the power to act substantively in a case until proceedings on appeal conclude.” The same day, the case was reassigned to Judge Richard G. Stearns.\n\nOn July 1, 2019, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to extend the appointment of the court monitor, subject to the First Circuit’s ruling on appeal. \n\nOn May 4, 2020, the First Circuit reversed the judgment of the district court. It held that because the parties’ agreement had provided for the monitor’s appointment to conclude on December 31, 2018, the district court had improperly extended the monitor’s appointment. On remand, the plaintiffs should have the opportunity to show “good cause” to modify the agreement by extending the monitor’s appointment; the district court should analyze the question in light of <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=126\"><i>Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail</i></a>. 958 F.3d 51\n\nThe First Circuit denied the plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing <i>en banc</i> (before the entire court, rather than the typical 3-judge panel) on June 17, 2020.

The DOJ asked the court to enjoin the State of Mississippi from discriminating against adults with mental illness and from failing to provide them with appropriate integrated community programs. \n\nThe DOJ claimed that Mississippi violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by \"administering the State's mental health service system in a manner that denies qualified adults with mental illness the benefits of the State's mental health services.\" See <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/MH-MS-0001-0001.pdf\">Complaint</a>. Further, the DOJ argued that State hospitals were segregated because they restricted contact with people without disabilities, and presented a lack of meaningful choice for patients in opportunities such as choosing friends, food, living space, activities, and employment.\n\nOn October 24, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate this case with <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12480\">Troupe v.

But soon afterward, the plaintiffs in both cases filed a motion for reconsideration of the consolidation. On March 19, 2017, District Court Judge Henry T. Wingate vacated the December 6 consolidation order, finding that there were few common questions of fact between the cases and that consolidating them would result in undue delays and injustice to the plaintiffs.\n\nAfter months of discovery, defendants moved for summary judgement on December 21, 2018, claiming that the plaintiffs lacked standing under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and had failed to prove that a reasonable modification of Mississippi's mental health system was available.

The government asked the court for injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants were depriving patients of MMHI of constitutional rights, privileges and immunities.  Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendants failed to provide adequate medical care, failed to provide individualized psychiatric care and treatment, and failed to provide adequate trained direct care and professional staff.\n\nThe CRIPA investigation began in 1990.  On November 2, 1990, the Department of Justice (DOJ) began sending internal memoranda recommending a CRIPA investigation of conditions at MMHI.  The preliminary findings indicated that conditions there included inadequate psychiatric care and treatment, inadequate supervision and neglect caused by an inadequate number of professional and direct care staff, as well as general medical care deficiencies, including overuse and misuse of medication and an unsafe and unsanitary environment.  On December 12, 1990, the DOJ sent the Governor of Tennessee a letter indicating an intention to investigate.  And, on April 4, 1991, the DOJ sent another letter to the Governor presenting interim findings.  In that letter, the DOJ indicated it found MMHI did not have a sufficient number of psychiatrists, nurses, or psychiatric technicians, and that DMH/MR planned to cut additional staff positions at MMHI.  On February 6, 1992, the DOJ sent another letter to the Governor presenting its findings.  In that letter, the DOJ indicated it found that MMHI failed to provide patients with adequate general and emergency medical care, had inadequate psychiatric care and medication practices, and employed improper and excessive use of physical restraints.  Further, in its findings letter, DOJ demanded implementation of certain remedial measures.\n\nApparently, the parties began negotiating a settlement before the CRIPA lawsuit was filed.

{"document": "Pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") conducted an investigation of conditions at the Nim Henson Geriatric Center (\"Henson\"), a county-operated skilled nursing facility in Jackson, Kentucky.  The investigation resulted in a findings letter being sent to Breathitt County's judge executive on March 6, 2003.  The letter stated that in June 2002, DOJ and certain of its expert consultants toured the facility, interviewed administrators, residents and staff, and reviewed medical and other records.  The DOJ's investigation led it to conclude that certain conditions at Henson violated residents' federal constitutional and statutory rights.  According to the DOJ, residents at Henson suffered from deficiencies in the following areas:  1) general medical care, 2) chemical restraints, 3) wound and nutritional care, 4) restorative care, 5) psychiatric care, and 6) incident management and quality assurance.\n\nThe findings letter described that the DOJ investigators determined that the facility's medication management practices; its medical notes and documentation; and its oversight and management of medical care did not meet generally accepted standards of care.  Among the identified systemic deficiencies were unjustified use on residents of polypharmacy and psychotropic medications, inadequate monitoring of medications' effects, and failure to re-evaluate the continued necessity or dosage units of certain drugs.  The investigation found poor or absent (i) physician-pharmacist consultations, (ii) medication policies and guidelines, (iii) diagnosis and treatment of underlying disorders (rather than symptoms), (iv) medical notes and documentation, and (v) oversight and management of medical care.\n\nThe facility employed sedation for reasons not associated with a medical condition, and the intermediate care unit within the facility provided substandard wound assessment, identification, care and tracking.  Failure to appropriately respond to instances of weight loss and overuse of feeding tubes reflected poor nutritional care at the facility.  Henson's failure to provide active (as opposed to passive) group activities, an absence of functional furniture, and care plans that failed to include restorative interventions addressing preventable declines in residents' functioning were other shortcomings described in the findings letter.  Particularly in the intermediate care unit, DOJ found that the nursing staff lacked a systematized approach to resident assessment and to the provision of early intervention regarding significant changes in resident status. Additionally, at least half of the residents sampled were receiving psychiatric care that substantially departed from generally accepted standards. No psychiatric and no behavioral professionals were available to the facility; physicians and nurses at the facility had no training in geriatric psychiatry generally, or in treating individuals experiencing dementia or depression; and residents who badly needed acute psychiatric care were rarely transferred to psychiatric hospitals. Henson's incident management efforts failed to pull relevant disciplines together to identify and provide needed supports and services to prevent falls and injuries. Likewise, the facility lacked an effective quality assurance system to track significant trends and events and ensure that proper corrective action occurs. Regarding discharge planning, the DOJ found that Henson's staff did not adequately evaluate or assess residents for their discharge potential.  It failed to have its treatment professionals periodically assess whether community-based treatment was appropriate.  These latter inadequacies violated the Americans with Disabilities Act-imposed obligation to treat residents in the most integrated setting appropriate to their individual needs.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 42 C.F.R. § 35.139(j).\n\nThe DOJ findings letter proposed remedial actions to remedy the multiple deficiencies, invited the county to address the issues, and alerted the county to the possibility of a CRIPA lawsuit brought by the United States to compel remedial action.\n\nOn February 17, 2004 the United States filed a complaint against Breathitt County, Kentucky, and Breathitt County Geriatric Corporation for violating CRIPA, 42 U.S.C. §1997, within the Nim Henson Nursing Home for the violations noted in the findings letter above. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendants failed to protect residents from harm and, further, failed “to provide adequate medical, nursing, nutritional, wound, restorative, and psychiatric care to residents” in the nursing home. Moreover, the complaint alleged that the defendants failed to continually assess whether the treatment needs of residents were being met. \n\nOn February 19, 2004, a settlement agreement was entered with the court. Through the settlement agreement the parties agreed to the following terms:  Defendants would ensure that residents shall be promptly assessed, diagnosed, treated, monitored, and, when necessary, reassessed, diagnosed, and treated with current, generally accepted standards of care, including documentation adequate to withstand clinical scrutiny. Defendants would develop policies to fully monitor medication distribution, and the effects of medications on patients. Defendants would keep accurate, current, complete, and organized medical documentation. Defendants would cease using restrictive controls and chemical restraints except in narrow situations. Defendants would create and maintain a documentation system, as well as a formulary, for patient wound care. Furthermore, defendants would ensure that nurses knew “the wound status of each resident in their care.” Defendants would monitor the weight and nutrition of residents and ensure that necessary interventions occurred. Defendants would ensure residents are able to have the highest quality of life possible and develop a restorative care plan for all residents. Defendants would provide necessary psychiatric care for residents. Defendants would investigate and follow up on all “unusual incidents” or incidents involving injury. Defendants would routinely assess residents to see if community placement is necessary. Defendants would provide the United States Department of Justice with status report within 90 days and provide continual, unrestricted access to buildings and facilities, staff, residents, and records relating to the settlement agreement, staff, or residents \n\nTwo years after the settlement agreement, the government found that the Nim Henson Nursing Home had been complying with all the terms of the settlement agreement.

On July 20, 2006, the Court denied both motions to dismiss. Judge Walker ruled that the government could not rely on the state secrets privilege and that a telecom defendant could not assert immunity. The Court, however, certified the case for immediate appeal. Hepting v. AT & T Corp., 439 F. Supp. 2d 974, 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2006). \n\nThe defendants' appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  On April 26, 2007, the Ninth Circuit consolidated Al-Haramain v. Bush, No. 06-36083, with this case.

AT & T Corp., 508 F.3d 898, 899 (9th Cir. 2007). Oral argument was heard in August 2007. \n\nPrior to any Ninth Circuit decision, in July 2008, Congress enacted and President George Bush signed, the FISA Amendments Act that granted retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies for past violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\") provided that the Attorney General of the United States certified to the relevant U.S. District Court that the surveillance did not occur, was legal, or was authorized by the president. The case was returned to the District Court in light of the FISA Amendments Act. Hepting v.

Walker) granted the United States' motion to dismiss based upon the retroactive immunity provision in the the FISA Amendments Act. Judge Walker dismissed the plaintiffs' claims, but without prejudice, saying that the plaintiffs could re-file if there was evidence of improper surveillance that fell outside the telecoms' immunity period found in the FISA amendments, which extended from Sept. 11, 2001 to Jan. 7, 2007.

The plaintiffs sued the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 552. The ACLU-NC claimed that it submitted a FOIA request to both TSA Headquarters and TSA's San Francisco Field Office for documents relating to searches of electronic devices of airline passengers, but neither provided any records. The plaintiff sought an order for the TSA to promptly process and release all responsive records, and a declaration that TSA's failure to disclose the requested records was unlawful. The plaintiffs claimed that the TSA violated FOIA by wrongfully withholding records, and specifically, they claimed that the TSA's searches of electronic devices at airports and borders (particularly of domestic air passengers) were a matter of significant public interest.  The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler.\n\nThe TSA moved to dismiss the complaint on June 13, 2018, claiming that (1) the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; (2) the TSA performed a reasonable and adequate search for records in response to the plaintiff's FOIA request; (3) the TSA lawfully and appropriately withheld information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA; and (4) the lawsuit was not necessary for the plaintiff to get the information it was entitled to under the FOIA. \n\nBetween June and July 2018, the ACLU-NC and the TSA stipulated that they were working in good faith to resolve some of the claims and issues in this action. On August 9, 2018, the parties acknowledged that there were no prior or pending motions, and that they anticipated the matter could be resolved on summary judgment.\n\nTSA filed notice of settlement on December 20, 2018.

The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.\n\nThe plaintiffs are two non-profit organizations: Council on American-Islamic Relations - Connecticut (CAIR-CT) and Make the Road New York (MRNY). In the complaint, they cited various examples of anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric from President Trump, as well as the Trump administration's Executive Orders banning entry into the United States of individuals from certain majority-Muslim countries. The plaintiffs argued that these incidents directly impacted their work of enhancing public understanding of Islam and empowering immigrant and working-class communities. \n\nThe plaintiffs submitted three FOIA requests in furtherance of their work to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and DOS. According to the complaint, the FOIA requests sought greater understanding of the administration's immigration enforcement policies out of a concern that the defendants have targeted individuals on the basis of actual or perceived religion, ethnicity, race, or national origin in enforcing their immigration policies. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought \"disclosure of agency policies, communications, and statistics related to visa processing and visa issuances for individuals applying abroad; to adjudication of entry document applications; and to screening and searching of individuals arriving at U.S. ports of entry.\" After the defendants did not produce any responsive records, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and \"to compel the disclosure and release of urgently needed records.\"\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Alfred V. Covello.\n\nThe parties entered into settlement negotiations, which remain active.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2018, the parties filed a status report indicating the defendants had completed their search for potentially responsive documents. The government was to produce the first set of documents on or before Feb. 23, 2018, with further productions made on a rolling basis every six weeks through June 2018.

The Departments of Defense, Justice, and State provided some records but the CIA denied the request in a \"Glomar\" response, which declines either to confirm or deny the existence of any records. The ACLU filed an administrative appeal to the CIA in April 2010, but the agency failed to make a determination within the FOIA statutorily established timeline.\n\nThe ACLU filed suit on June 1, 2010 against the government in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging violations of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a) and requesting injunctive relief in the form of disclosure of the requested documents. Under court supervision, the Departments of Defense, Justice, and State conferred with the ACLU and produced documents according to a mutually agreeable schedule.\n\nThe CIA, however, moved for summary judgment in October 2010, arguing that whether it possessed the documents was itself exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemptions. The CIA argued that admitting the very existence of the documents would reveal whether it was involved or interested in drone strikes, which was classified information. The ACLU cross-filed for summary judgment and asserted that the CIA Director and other officials had already publicly acknowledged the existence of the drone program. The district court granted the CIA's motion for summary judgment on September 9, 2011. American Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't of Justice, 808 F. Supp. 2d 280 (D.D.C. 2011). \n\nThe ACLU appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on November 9, 2011. The D.C. Circuit Court found the CIA's Glomar response was not justified. American Civil Liberties Union v. Central Intelligence Agency, 710 F.3d 422 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Citing numerous examples of public statements by U.S. officials like the President and CIA Director, the court found it \"implausible that the CIA does not possess a single document on the subject of drone strikes.\" 710 F.3d at 430. In March 2013, the case was remanded to the district court for determination of the kinds of documents that the CIA possesses and whether exemptions apply to those documents.\n\nIn May, the district court ordered briefing for summary judgment, following the recommendation of the CIA's briefing schedule.  The schedule was delayed multiple times due to a series of government budget crises in the Fall of 2013. On February 12, 2014, the ACLU sent a notice to the court of a congressional transcript where the CIA publicly acknowledged drone operations. The court ordered a supplemental brief from the CIA regarding this public disclosure.  \n\nOn, June 6, 2014, the court granted the CIA's motion to stay the proceedings until the completion of any further review of a recent decision in the Second Circuit that involved FOIA requests for some similar types of records. New York Times Co. v. DOJ, 752 F.3d 123 (2nd Cir., April 21, 2014). The Second Circuit revised and superseded their opinion on June 23, 2014, finding that the government's secrecy and privilege had been waived for some of the documents containing legal analysis relating to drone strikes. New York Times Co. v. DOJ, 756 F.3d 100 (2nd Cir., July 10, 2014). \n\nOn July 25, 2014, the court granted the defendant's request to dismiss the summary judgment motion. The court also found that the recent developments required further briefing and denied the ACLU's partial summary judgment without prejudice and scheduled further briefing. \n\nOn November 25, 2014, the CIA moved for summary judgement. In response, the ACLU filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\nOn June 18, 2015, the district court granted summary judgment and denied ACLU's cross-motion for summary judgment. The court held that the CIA had demonstrated that it has not withheld any segregable, non-exempt materials other than previously disclosed White Paper and therefore denied ACLU’s request that it order the CIA to do so. 109 F.Supp.3d 220.

{"document": "In June 2009, the plaintiff, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to defendant National Security Agency (NSA) for records related to National Security Presidential Directive 54 (NSPD 54) and to the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI). The defendant released several redacted documents. However, it informed the plaintiff that it had no records responsive to the Cybersecurity Initiative, and records responsive to the NSPD 54 request were withheld under FOIA exemptions for inter-agency memoranda, classified information, and presidential communications privilege.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an administrative appeal, and brought suit in United States District Court for the District of Columbia in February 2009 against NSA and the National Security Council (NSC) under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, seeking production of the records and a Vaughn index of withheld records and applicable exemptions.\n\nIn July 2011, Judge Beryl A. Howell dismissed the NSC as a defendant because it was not an \"agency\" within the meaning of FOIA. \n\nThe parties cross-moved for summary judgment in late 2011. Nearly two years later, in October 2013, the Court (Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell) ruled that NSPD 54 was not an agency record at all because it originated with the President or the NSC, and contained clear limits on its use and further dissemination. Thus, NSPD 54 was \"the type of document that is generally not ordered disclosed under the FOIA.\" However, the Court ruled that several portions of the plaintiff's FOIA request survived because the requested records originated within the Defendant. The Defendant was ordered to produce those responsive records or to submit a Vaughn index detailing the records and applicable exemptions. 2013 WL 5701645.\n\nOn December 17, 2013, plaintiff appealed the October 2013 order, seeking review of whether the district court erred in holding that a Presidential Directive in the possession of a federal agency is not an agency record subject to FOIA. \n\nOn June 5, 2014, defendant released an unclassified version of NSPD 54 to the plaintiff. On June 9, 2014, the parties jointly moved to dismiss plaintiff's appeal as moot, vacate the district court order holding that a Presidential Directive in the possession of a federal agency is not an agency record subject to FOIA, and remand to address any claim for fees. The Court (Judge Judith W. Rogers, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, and Senior Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg) granted the order and remanded the case on July 31, 2014. 2014 WL 12596363.\n\nThe plaintiff moved for attorney fees and costs on October 31, 2014. The plaintiff sought $68,354.01 in attorneys' fees and $730.28 in costs, including fees and costs incurred prior to the January Judgment. The defendant argued that since the plaintiff was not the prevailing party under FOIA, they were not entitled to attorney's fees. Alternatively, the defendant contended that the plaintiff could not seek any fees for the period prior to the January Judgment and sought modification of the fees after the January judgment. \n\nThe Court granted in part and denied in part plaintiff's motion on April 8, 2015. The Court held that the plaintiff was the prevailing party as the initial withholding of NSPD 54 was not correct as a matter of law because the Court's initial order regarding NSPD 54 was vacated. Since the defendant voluntarily released NSPD 54 to the plaintiff and requested the vacatur of the prior holding, the defendant had appeared to change its position regarding the requested information, thus, the plaintiff prevailed. The Court held the plaintiff was not able to recover fees and costs prior to January 27, 2014 as they were covered by the January Judgment. The Court also disallowed fees incurred by the plaintiff after October 1, 2014. The Court found that since the plaintiff offered two settlement agreements within 24 hours of the deadline for the parties to provide a status report to the Court and immediately withdrew them once the submission was filed, the plaintiff prolonged litigation. As such, the plaintiff was not allowed to recover fees following the withdrawal of their first settlement offer on October 1, 2014. Following these fee deductions, the defendant was ordered to pay $31,180 in attorneys' fees and costs. 87 F.Supp.3d 223. \n\nOn April 8, 2015, the plaintiff moved to alter judgment regarding the Court's April 2015 order.

Plaintiff, represented by the MacArthur Justice Center, Jenner & Block, and the National Lawyers Guild, therefore filed this suit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. \n\nIn the complaint, plaintiff argued that it had submitted its FOIA request to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Mar. 7, 2017. Specifically, plaintiff sought the following:\n1. Records created on or after Jan. 24, 2017 related to CBP's search, review, retention, and dissemination of information located on or accessed through electronic devices in the possession of individuals who were encountered by CBP at the border (and the border's functional equivalents); and\n2. Records created on or after Feb. 27, 2017 that pertained to the second Executive Order and were otherwise responsive to the first request. \n\nOn May 2, this case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. Also on May 2, plaintiff filed notice that it believed this case should be marked related to <a href= \"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15701\"><i>Knight First Amendment Institute v. DHS</i></a>.\n\nOn Aug. 4, Oct. 6, and Nov. 3, the parties filed joint status reports discussing the progress of the search and document turnover. On Nov. 28, the parties met for a status conference before Judge Chutkan, who ordered that the government, by Dec. 19, provide plaintiff with an estimate regarding the completion date of document production. \n\nThe next status report of Jan. 29, 2018, detailed the parties' discussions about search terms. Plaintiff reported that CBP had estimated it would finish production by Sept. 2018 and DHS had provided no estimate. Plaintiff sought an earlier production, but defendants asserted they needed this time to properly review documents before releasing them.\n\nAfter a Feb. 21, 2018 status conference, Judge Chutkan ordered CBP to produce 275 pages per month. A May 14 order clarified that CBP was to process 500 email record pages per month and also 275 pages of incident-level reports per month. DHS was to process 775 email record and complaint pages per month. July and September status reports indicated the government's review and production were underway. \n\nProduction of documents and status reports continued until Jan. 22, 2019, when the case was stayed until Congress restored appropriations to the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The stay was lifted on Feb. 27, 2019, and production of documents continued. The parties have been submitting status reports regularly. As of Apr. 14, 2020, this case is ongoing.

{"document": "On October 5, 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (ACLUF) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of an American citizen being detained by the United States military in Iraq. The plaintiff sued the Secretary of Defense under the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. §2241, the Non-Detention Act of 1971, and 18 U.S.C. § 4001(a). The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, claiming violations of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Defense Department had detained the plaintiff since on or around September 14, 2017, after Syrian forces transferred him to U.S. Custody. The Defense Department asserted it was detaining the plaintiff because he was allegedly fighting for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (\"ISIS\") in Syria. The ACLUF claimed that the Defense Department held the plaintiff \"without charge, without access to a court or other meaningful opportunity to challenge his detention before a neutral decisionmaker, and without access to counsel.\"\n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on October 30, 2017. They alleged that the ACLUF lacked standing to seek habeas corpus relief on the plaintiff's behalf and that the circumstances did not warrant the ACLUF's immediate access to the plaintiff.

The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance.

Woods) ruled on the motions for summary judgment, holding that the ACLU's motion was granted with respect to the scope of DOJ's search, and that the DOJ's motion was granted with respect to the applicability of Exemption 5 to the documents that had already been found. The court ordered the DOJ to conduct a new search for documents including \"legal memoranda or opinions addressing or interpreting the [FISA Amendment Act's] notice provisions or requirements, as set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1181e(a) and § 1806(c).\" The order required the DOJ to search for any relevant documents without limiting the search to \"governing\" documents, and to release any responsive documents that didn't fall under a FOIA exemption. Because the granted motions for summary judgment disposed of all issues in the case, the court also ordered the case closed. \n\nOn March 5, 2015, the court issued an order reopening the case in order to allow the parties to litigate the issue regarding the search for responsive documents in United States Attorney's Offices that hadn't previously been searched.

These requests sought information on the widely-cited statistics on the National Security Agency's (NSA) upstream internet surveillance program, and the 2008 version of the FBI's standard minimization procedures for data collection.</li> </ul>The government filed a response acknowledging receipt of the brief and the various FOIA requests, but alleged that the government was cooperating in the FOIA records request and no legal action was necessary on October 11, 2016.\n\nOutside of the court, the parties agreed to a document release schedule, and submitted a schedule for document release on March 1, 2017. The schedule was not publicized, though the docket shows that release dates for a few of the documents were slightly altered over the course of the year. On October 11, 2017, the plaintiffs submitted a status report to the court showing that the parties cooperated in releasing the requested documents. Judge Kaplan dismissed the case on October 26, 2017; it is now closed.\n\nThe released documents provided important context to frequently cited surveillance and interrogation information, while leaving other important questions unanswered. A brief summary of the collected documents is available below:<ul> <li>For the Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation reports, the reporter found examples of three new areas of information not previously publicized. The first noted that Obama-era officials asked the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) if it wanted to use anything other than the Army Field Manual detention policies, and the CIA did not suggest an alternative. Second, it added that the CIA maintained a policy of transferring detainees to countries where they might be abused on a case-by-case basis. Third, it noted that the CIA maintained policies allowing for prisoner separation in detention centers, which previously had been used to authorize torture techniques like sleep deprivation.</li><li>For the Stellarwind bulk collection discovery memo, the unredacted sections of the documents did not provide a clear policy for when the Justice Department needs to turn over classified information to a defendant in a terrorism case, in line with <i>Brady</i> prosecutorial standards. However, the memo did note that this is an issue that the DOJ needs to grapple with in the future.</li> <li>For the 2008 FBI Standard Minimization Procedures, the reporter found that it allowed the FBI to search for evidence of an ordinary crime in the warrantless surveillance repository.</li> <li>Finally, the 2011 FISC documents confirmed that Judge Bates' frequently cited statistic that nine percent of all internet communications picked up by the NSA came through the upstream surveillance program, which pulled its information from internet switchboards rather than email accounts, may be misleading. The released documents showed that the NSA referred to \"communication\" and \"transaction\" interchangeably, and that one transaction can contain multiple internet communications, like emails. As a result, the nine percent provided by Judge Bates could be a larger or smaller percentage depending on how many bits of internet communication were picked up in each \"transaction.\" The released documents demonstrated that some of these upstream communications contained information from purely domestic servers, though it was a small percentage.</li> </ul>", "summary": "On September 7, 2016, the <i>New York Times</i> and one of its reporters focusing on national security issues filed this lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act for documents on forced interrogation policy, statistics on the National Security Agency's (NSA) upstream internet surveillance program, and on issues related to discovery in classified terrorism cases. The parties amicably agreed to a document release schedule, and the case closed on October 26, 2017. Of interest in the released documents is the revelation that the government may have been collecting different percentages of communications through upstream surveillance than previously believed."}

{"document": "This 2017 lawsuit challenged the FBI’s placement of a U.S. citizen on a terrorist watchlist; it was dismissed in 2019.\n\nThe Terrorism Screening DataBase, also known as the “terrorist watchlist,” is maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), a division of the National Security Branch of the FBI. The watchlist includes sub-lists--a No Fly List and a Selectee List. People on the No Fly List are not allowed to fly on American airplanes or flights into the US. People included on the Selectee List are subject to additional screening by federal government officials at airports and land border crossings into the US. At airports, individuals on the Selectee List often have their boarding passes stamped with “SSSS” by airline agents.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff claimed that he was subjected to extra security procedures at airports as early as 2014, perhaps because he was a cleric at his mosque (in Salt Lake City). The events more directly leading up to this litigation commenced in June 2017 when the plaintiff was denied boarding to a commercial flight bound for the U.S. by airport officials in Nairobi, Kenya. Though he was eventually allowed to board a flight the following day, he missed his connecting flight in Los Angeles because of a long screening process. The plaintiff flew domestically on three other instances in 2017 and each time the ticketing agent called the TSC and marked his boarding pass with the “SSSS” stamp. He filed this lawsuit on June 17, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, alleging constitutional violations. \n\nIn a final amended complaint filed November 2017, the plaintiff sued the Directors of the FBI and TSC, the Administrator of the TSA, and the Commissioner of the National Counterterrorism Center, all in their official capacities.\n\nRepresented by attorneys from the Council on American Islamic Relations and private counsel, the lawsuit sought injunctive and declaratory relief based on four main claims. First, the plaintiff argued that his placement on the Selectee List violated his Fifth Amendment rights to procedural and substantive due process. Second, he asserted that his inclusion on the selectee list was an unlawful agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§702, 706). Third, he argued that his inclusion on the watchlist violated his Fifth Amendment Right to equal protection. Fourth, he urged that the Executive branch’s implementation of the terrorist watchlist amounted to a violation of the Constitution’s non-delegation doctrine. \n\nThe Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of jurisdiction. In an order dated April 20, 2018, District Judge Dee Benson rejected the government’s jurisdictional arguments but granted its motion for failure to state a claim. For the procedural due process claim, Judge Benson found that the right to travel in a convenient or unimpeded fashion has not been recognized by the Supreme Court as a liberty interest protected by the Fifth Amendment and that the plaintiff failed to adequately allege reputational damage that satisfies a “stigma plus” standard. Judge Benson found the substantive due process claim unconvincing for similar reasons, writing that the plaintiff failed to provide case law supporting his contention that “freedom of movement” is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Likewise, because a constitutionally protected interest had not been identified by the plaintiff, the District Judge held that the APA claim similarly failed. For the equal protection claim, Judge Benson found that the plaintiff did not produce evidence of intentional discrimination against Muslims and refused to allow the claim to proceed on a disparate impact theory alone. Lastly, the non-delegation claim was dismissed because the Judge found that Congress charged the TSA with “overall responsibility for airline security” and that this is general policy establishes an “intelligible principle” that does not violate the doctrine of non-delegation. 2018 WL 1940411.\n\nOn appeal, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of all claims in an opinion by Circuit Judge David Ebel. 942 F. 3d 1019 (Nov. 12, 2019).", "summary": "In 2017, an American Citizen who is a cleric at a mosque in Salt Lake City filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah.

Specifically, plaintiffs sought information \"concerning CBP’s local implementation of President Trump’s January 27, 2017 Executive Order...as well as any other judicial order or executive directive issued regarding Executive Order No. 1, including President Trump’s March 6, 2017 Executive Order.\"\n\nThe request concerned implementation at international airports within the purview of CBP's Baltimore Field Office, including Washington Dulles International Airport, Baltimore Washington International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Pittsburgh International Airport (\"Local International Airports\"), and Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Port of Washington-Dulles and Wilmington (\"Port of Entry Offices\").

{"document": "This is one of several federal lawsuits addressing North Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (“H.B. 2”), which was passed in March 23, 2016. For the others, see related cases section, below. \n\nOn February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed Ordinance 7056, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in public accommodations, passenger vehicle for hire, and city contractors. The city ordinance was set to take effect on April 1, 2016.\n\nIn response, on March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature held a special session and passed House Bill 2; it was signed that same day by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. HB2 prohibited municipalities in North Carolina from enacting anti-discrimination policies and removed the statutory and common-law private right of action to enforce state anti-discrimination statutes in state courts. It also required that while in government buildings, individuals only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. For many transgender people, this prevented them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity (in North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery can change the sex on their birth certificates; some other jurisdictions have even more restrictive rules). In addition, the legislation changed the definition of sex in the state's anti-discrimination law to \"the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.” This change prevented discrimination against transgender people from being classified as a type of sex discrimination. \n\nOn May 4, in a letter to Governor Pat McCrory, the Justice Department informed him that the U.S. had concluded that HB2 violated federal law. The DOJ asked the Governor to respond by close of business on May 9 that he would remedy the violations, \"including by confirming that the State will not comply with or implement H.B. 2.\"\n\nInstead of providing the demanded assurances, the Governor sued the United States on the morning of May 9, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, seeking declaratory relief that HB2 didn’t violate federal law.

They began by alleging that transgender people weren't a protected class under the Fourteenth Amendment, and thus could not be protected under Title VII, which is authorized by the Fourteenth Amendment. They based their Tenth Amendment federalism claims primarily on the argument that regulation of bathrooms didn't affect interstate commerce and were thus a police power reserved to the states. They also suggested that there was a constitutional right to privacy in bathrooms that would be violated if states were forced to allow transgender individuals access to bathrooms in accordance with their gender identities. \n\nPlaintiffs further made arguments that the DOJ’s position wasn’t acceptable under administrative law. Plaintiffs suggested that the DOJ’s reasoning on the VAWA would require North Carolina to provide prisoners claiming transgender status access to bathrooms and showers matching their gender identities, which they claimed would violate earlier regulations promulgated by the DOJ on that subject. They also claimed that the states couldn’t have foreseen that they would be forced to allow transgender individuals access to bathrooms when Title IX was enacted, which would mean that the DOJ was exceeding its authority by adding meaning to the statute that Congress hadn’t originally intended or expected it to have.\n \nThis case was assigned to Judge Louise Wood Flanagan. The plaintiffs sought consolidation with the <i>McCrory</i> case, which was before Judge Terrence W. Boyle. On June 13, 2016, Judge Boyle issued an order stating that he would allow the cases to be consolidated. On June 15, Judge Flanagan scheduled a hearing to determine whether the cases should be consolidated.\n\nIn the hearing, the court denied the motion to consolidate and instead transferred this case to the Middle District of North Carolina, where three other HB2 cases were in progress, with no objection from any of the parties. The transfer order was given on June 29, 2016, and this case was assigned to Judge Thomas D. Schroeder and Magistrate Judge Joi Elizabeth Peake. \n\nOn July 14, the judge ordered the parties in this case and the three associated HB2 cases in North Carolina to appear on August 1 on their various motions pending in a consolidated hearing, and indicated the trials would take place in October or November. The Judge requested they file a joint statement of agreements reached and explaining their respective positions by July 22 for a pretrial scheduling conference.

{"document": "Clayworth Healthcare Pharmacy (a Medicaid service provider) and two Medicaid recipients filed a civil suit challenging California's then-pending 5% reduction in the reimbursement rate paid to Medicaid providers. The suit was filed on March 19, 2003 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, against Diana M. Bonta, the Director of the Department of Health Services of the State of California (DHS), in her official capacity, and against the DHS.\n\nOn November 07, 2003, another suit raising substantially similar issues was filed by the California Medical Association and thirteen other groups representing Medicaid providers, together with the Disabled Rights Union, a non-profit association of disabled persons. The suit was brought against Ms. Bonta in her official capacity. The Court determined on November 19, 2003, that the two cases were sufficiently related that they should be heard before the same judge and magistrate, but declined to officially consolidate them as a single case with a shared docket. All the substantive orders and opinions subsequently issued by the Court decided issues relating to both cases.  Both are included here.\n\nThe Plaintiffs alleged that the 5% reduction in the reimbursement rate violated the quality of care and equal access provisions of the Medicaid statute. They also argued that the reduction was a de facto amendment to California's federally approved Medicaid plan, and that all such amendments required Federal approval. They sought a preliminary injunction preventing the DHS from implementing the reduction while the issue was in court, and a permanent injunction to enjoin California from reducing the rates paid to providers for services and to require the State to rely on cost studies to ensure rates were reasonably related to the cost to the providers of providing services to Medicaid recipients. They also sought a declaration from the Court that the 5% reduction was unlawful, and to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe Court (Judge David F. Levi) granted the motions of the Plaintiffs in both cases for preliminary injunctions in an Order and Opinion dated December 23, 2003. He held that a cause of action existed under 42 U.S.C § 1983 allowing private plaintiffs to sue states for denying Medicaid beneficiaries their federally guaranteed right to equal access to quality medical services. He held that California had approved the reduction in provider costs without considering the impact the reduction would have on such access, and that therefore the pending rate reduction was arbitrary and unlawful. In the same decision, he dismissed the claims against the DHS itself, but not those against Ms. Bonta, as barred under the Eleventh Amendment. Clayworth v. Bonta, 295 F.Supp.2d 1110 (C.D. Cal. 2003).\n\nOn January 8, 2004, the remaining Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 2, 2005, the three-judge panel unanimously reversed the decision of the of the lower court, holding that no cause of action existed under § 1983 that would allow Medicaid providers or recipients to challenge the State's level of compliance with the equal access and quality of care provisions of Medicaid, citing the decision in Sanchez v. Johnson (416 F.3d 1051), which was issued by the same three-judge panel on the same day as this opinion (see related cases). Clayworth v. Bonta, 140 Fed.Appx. 677 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\nIn light of the decision from the Appellate Court, the District Court dismissed both cases, Cal. Med.

Bonta) were filed by Medicaid service providers and recipients seeking to enjoin California from reducing its disbursement rate to Medicaid providers by 5%. The cases were both filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, and the Court found that the issues in the cases were substantially similar and therefore chose to relate them, assigning them to the same Judge. The Judge at the District Court granted a preliminary injunction preventing California from implementing the rate reduction, finding that to do so would violate the federally guaranteed right to equal access to quality medical services for Medicaid beneficiaries. The Defendant appealed, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that their was no cause of action that would allow Medicaid providers or recipients to challenge a State's compliance with the equal access provisions of Medicaid. The cases were later dismissed."}

The plaintiffs in both suits were represented by private counsel. In the first case, the plaintiffs represented intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled as well as freestanding pediatric subacute care facilities. The plaintiffs in the second case also represented intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled.\n\nThe plaintiffs in both cases sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent California from implementing aspects of legislation passed by the State Assembly that would freeze Medicaid reimbursement rates for these facilities at either their 2008-09 or 2009-10 levels (the Clearinghouse contains several related cases filed in response to this and similar legislation). Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. (the Medicaid Act), such modifications must be approved by the federal Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prior to being put in place. The legislation passed by the California assembly was not conditioned on such approval. The plaintiffs alleged that no studies or other analyses had been conducted that could show that the rate freezes were consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care requirements of 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(30)(A). The plaintiffs in both cases sought relief under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, arguing that the California law was incompatible with federal Medicaid law and therefore preempted. The plaintiffs in Developmental Services Network also claimed as a cause of action 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which creates a private cause of action for state violations of federally guaranteed rights under color of law. \n\nOn May 27, 2010, the plaintiffs in Developmental Services Network filed an amended complaint, which made further arguments in support of the plaintiffs' standing to bring the suit, but the complaint did not appear to have added any substantive claims or requests for relief.\n\nOn June 15, 2010, the Court granted the defendants' motion to consolidate the two cases.

Developmental Services Network v. Douglas, 666 F.3d 540 (9th Cir. 2011).

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is an action filed in response to the CARES Act and an interim final rule from the Department of Education regarding how funds could be distributed between private and public schools. The court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the interim final rule on August 26, 2020. On November 9, the court approved a permanent injunction that prohibited the defendants from implementing the interim rule and from taking any action inconsistent with the proportional share formula provided by Congress. The court retained jurisdiction over the case for enforcement purposes. <hr>\n\nThis lawsuit arose out of the funding provisions for elementary and secondary schools in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) of 2020. Filed by eight states (California, Michigan, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin), Washington D.C., and four school districts (Chicago, Cleveland, New York City, and San Francisco), the lawsuit challenged a July 1, 2020 interim final rule from the Department of Education about how the funds may be distributed between private and public schools.\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) of 2020 was passed on March 27, 2020 to provide trillions of dollars in financial relief, and other assistance, to Americans suffering from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The CARES Act set aside approximately $16 billion to help elementary and secondary schools, particularly those schools with low-income students. The money was to be allocated based on the amount of Title I funding each state and school district received in the most recent year. Private schools were eligible to receive funds in certain circumstances consistent with established Title I criteria-the number of children from low-income families who attend the school. \n\nThe Department of Education issued non-binding guidance on April 30, 2020 directing that private schools should get a share of CARES Act money based on their overall student population not just their number of low-income students. Widespread pushback followed, but nonetheless, on July 1, 2020, the Department published an interim final rule instructing that CARES Act money be apportioned to private schools based on the number of all children enrolled, not just low income children, or apportioned based on low-income private school children and incur poison pill requirements on how the public school share of the money may be used.\n\nIn response, Michigan, California, Washington D.C., Maine, New Mexico, and Wisconsin filed this lawsuit against the Secretary of Education (Betsy Devos) and the Department of Education in the U.S. District Court for Northern District of California on July 7, 2020. The plaintiffs argued that the rule exceeded the Department's authority, was not in accordance with the governing law, violated separation of powers principles, and violated the Constitution's spending clause. In addition, the states argued that the rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because the Department acted arbitrary and capricious and bypassed notice and comment procedures required by the APA. The plaintiffs sought attorneys' fees and costs, a declaration that the July 1 rule and the April 30 guidance document are unlawful, and preliminary and permanent relief preventing the Department from enforcing the rule. On July 17, 2020, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add additional states (Hawaii, Maryland, and Pennsylvania) and four school districts (Chicago, Cleveland, New York City, and San Francisco) as plaintiffs. The case was assigned to Judge James Donato.\n\nWith the school year approaching, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the rule on July 20, 2020, arguing that the rule threatens imminent and irreparable harm to to schools and students across the country. The plaintiffs stressed that as a result of the rule, public schools would lose CARES Act funding in contradiction to Congress intent. The court held a hearing on the preliminary injunction on August 18, 2020. \n\nOn August 26, 2020 Judge Donato granted a preliminary injunction against the rule. 2020 WL 5074397 (Aug. 26, 2020). <i>Michigan v. DeVos</i>, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2020). Judge Donato explained that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim rule was an unlawful action under the APA because it exceeded the Department's authority. Congress's intent was plain and clear that the funds should be distributed according to formula in Section 1117 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which is based on the number of low-income families who attended private schools. Judge Donato called the Department's argument for the rule \"'interpretive jiggery-pokery' in the extreme,\" and questioned why Congress would include Section 1117, if it did not intend the formula to be used: \"If Congress did not mean to use the formula in Section 1117, wouldn't it simply have omitted any reference to it in the first place? But since Congress expressly referred to Section 1117, what exactly does the Department think that means?\"\n\nOn October 9, the Department of Education issued new guidance that replaced the rule. \n\nOn November 6, the defendants consented to the entry of a permanent injunction that prevented the defendants from implementing the April 30 guidance and taking any action inconsistent with the proportional share formula in Section 1117 or other restrictions or penalties on the use of CARES Act funds. The defendants waived their rights to seek reconsideration of or appeal of the decision.\n\nOn November 9, the court approved the permanent injunction and issued a judgment on November 11.

{"document": "Title XIX of the Social Security Act (SSA) has provided medical care assistance to certain vulnerable populations under a cooperative federal-state arrangement, approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). In 2010 Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (“Obamacare”) that expanded Medicare coverage to include an additional group of low-income adults under the age of 65. While all states were obliged to comply with the Medicaid Act, states had a choice on whether to expand Medicaid. States that chose to participate in the program and comply with minimum federal requirements, such as expanding coverage, received funding from the federal government to provide the care.\n\nIn certain narrow cases, states were permitted to waive certain Medicaid Act requirements under § 1115 of the SSA, but only when the waiver promoted the objectives of the Medicaid Act. Otherwise, states were forbidden from picking and choosing individuals within a covered group. Arkansas was one of the first states to expand Medicare after the ACA was passed, starting in January 2014 to include adults under the age of 65 through private care. The expansion was renamed “Arkansas Works” (AW) when it was renewed in in 2016 and extended through 2021. At this time, Arkansas requested to institute a work requirement in Medicaid as a requirement for health coverage, which was denied by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because it was inconsistent with the purposes of the Medicaid program.\n\nHowever, in 2017 the Trump Administration called on federal agencies to undo the ACA and introduced another purpose to Medicare, which was to promote enrollees to work. This resulted in CMS inviting states to implement exceptions to the SSA. In March 2017, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson proposed amendments to the AW to institute a work requirement and shrink retroactive health coverage. Changing its original position from 2016, the Secretary of the HSS approved the Arkansas Works Amendments (AWA), including the work condition, on March 5, 2018. \n\nOn August 14, 2018, three individuals filed a lawsuit against HHS and CMS in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the SSA by the federal government in approving the AWA in March 2018. The AWA, according to the plaintiffs, sought to undermine the ACA and the expansion of Medicaid through a fundamental alteration of those statues. The plaintiffs claimed that the AWA was in violation of the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, which limits presidential power from rewriting congressional statutes, and ensures execution of laws passed by the Congress. All three plaintiffs were beneficiaries of Medicaid who lost or risked losing medical coverage due to changes in the AW program, which required 80 hours of employment per month for able-bodied adults from 19-49, reported online, as a requirement for health coverage. One of the plaintiffs lost his Medicaid coverage and subsequently his job after he failed to meet the AWA work requirement by not reporting his compliance in June 2018. The two other plaintiffs, employed at the time of the lawsuit, anticipated losing their Medicare coverage due to the new work requirements.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the HHS violated the US Constitution and federal laws in approving the Medicaid work requirement and that the SSA did not permit the Secretary of HHS to waive federal Medicaid requirements. Represented by Legal Aid of Arkansas, Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Health Law Program, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the AWA and attorney fees. The case was assigned to Judge James E. Bosaberg. \n\nOn November 5, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with additional plaintiffs who also faced loss of coverage. The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the same day, asking the court to strike down the Medicaid work requirement, alleging that the federal government approved the requirements without due process. The state of Arkansas also intervened as a defendant on November 30, 2018.\n\nJudge Bosaberg held that government action was arbitrary and capricious if the government failed to adequately consider an important aspect of a problem under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which requires courts to set aside government actions that are “arbitrary, capricious” or unlawful. The court stated that the Secretary had a duty to determine whether the proposed AWA would promote the objectives of Medicaid, including whether it advances or hinders health coverage to the needy. In considering the merits of the plaintiff’s claims, Judge Bosaberg considered whether the Secretary, in concluding that the AWA program promoted the objectives of the Medicaid Act, acted arbitrarily or capriciously. \n\nThis challenge was previously considered in a separate suit in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16440\"><i>Stewart v. Azar</i></a>, where the court determined if an agency had adequately considered whether a waiver proposal from Kentucky would advance medical assistance to its citizens. The court in <i>Stewart v. Azar</i> vacated the waiver in question, which also included a work requirement, because the agency failed to sufficiently consider the impact of the proposed project on Medicaid coverage. \n\nOn March 27, 2019, the court found that the Secretary of the HHS failed to adequately consider how the AWA would lead to loss of coverage for a substantial number of Arkansas residents, including the needy. Because coverage to the needy was a core objective of Medicaid, the court held that the AWA did not advance the purpose of Medicaid. Therefore, its approval was arbitrary and capricious. Correspondingly, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants’ cross-motions on April 10, 2019. Like the holding in <i>Stewart v. Azar</i>, the approval for Arkansas’s program was also vacated. 363 F.Supp.3d 165.\n\nOn April 10, 2019, the federal defendants and the state of Arkansas each appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, docketed as 19-5094 (federal defendants’ appeal) and 19-5096 (state of Arkansas’s appeal). The parties briefed the appeal and oral arguments were held on October 11, 2019.\n\nOn February 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment vacating the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas Works Amendments. <i>See Gresham v. Azar</i>, 950 F.3d 93 (D.C. Cir. 2020). The decision applied to both appeals as a consolidated matter. Written by Senior Circuit Judge Sentelle, the opinion emphasized that providing healthcare coverage is the primary purpose of Medicaid. The defendants' alternative objectives of better health outcomes, financial independence, and transition to commercial coverage, on the other hand, were not consistent with Medicaid. The appellate court found the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas program to be arbitrary and capricious due to the failure to consider whether the program would result in loss of coverage, an important aspect of the approval analysis.\n\nAs of May 11, 2020, the defendants had not filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.

{"document": "This is a case about the Trump Administration's limits on LGBTQ protections under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. § 18116). On June 22, 2020, a group of LGBTQ-focused private healthcare providers, organizations providing community services, health professional associations, and individual providers filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706), claiming that the defendants violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Represented by both Lambda Legal and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorney's fees. Specifically, they alleged that the revised regulation issued under § 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) by HHS under the Trump Administration limits protections for LGBTQ individuals and causes harm to them and healthcare providers.\n\nIn 2010, President Obama signed the ACA into law. Section 1557 prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, color, national origin, age, and disability. In 2016, HHS enacted a final rule (the \"2016 Rule\") to implement the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 1557. The 2016 Rule defined sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex stereotyping and declared that healthcare providers and insurers cannot discriminate against LGBTQ individuals in medical and coverage decisions. In June 2020, however, the Trump Administration issued a revised regulation (the \"2020 Rule\"), which rolled back the 2016 Rule. The 2020 Rule eliminated the unitary legal standard for enforcement of violations of Section 1557 and introduced broad exemptions for discrimination based on personal religious or moral beliefs.\n\nThis case was assigned to Judge James E. Boasberg. On July 9, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction or, in the alternative, motion to stay pending judicial review. The defendants filed their opposition on July 24, and the plaintiffs answered the defendants' opposition on July 29. On September 2, the court enjoined the Administration from implementing two provisions: (1) the 2020 Rule's elimination of \"sex stereotyping\" from the 2016 Rule's definition of \"discrimination on the basis of sex\" and (2) the 2020 Rule's use of Title IX's exemption of certain religious organizations from the statute’s nondiscrimination mandate. The court limited the injunction to claims it concluded had a likelihood of success, and thus denied relief for the plaintiffs' claims that the 2020 Rule erroneously eliminated the 2016 Rule’s prohibition on categorical coverage exclusions for gender-affirming care, improperly repealed the 2016 Rule’s notice requirements, and violated Section 1554 of the ACA. Because the court did not find those claims to have a likelihood of success, it also did not award relief for the plaintiffs' constitutional claims. The injunction applied nationwide. In its opinion addressing the motion for a preliminary injunction, the court also analyzed whether or not the plaintiffs had standing to bring their claims. Citing the fear instilled in the LGBTQ community as evidence of imminent injury, the court found that the plaintiffs had organizational standing for their four common-injury claims and two of their five organizational-injury claims of injuries caused by the 2020 Rule. The court also held that the plaintiffs had third-party standing to assert the equal-protection, substantive-due-process, and free-speech rights of third-party LGBTQ patients.\n\nThis case is ongoing.", "summary": "In June 2020, the Trump Administration's Department of Health and Human Services issued a revised regulation under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act that limited protections for discrimination against LGBTQ individuals.

On September 2, the court found that the plaintiffs had standing for most of their claims, and enjoined the Administration from implementing two provisions: (1) the 2020 Rule's elimination of \"sex stereotyping\" from the 2016 Rule's definition of \"discrimination on the basis of sex\" and (2) the 2020 Rule's use of Title IX's exemption of certain religious organizations from the statute’s nondiscrimination mandate. It denied relief for the 2020 Rule's elimination of the 2016 Rule’s prohibition on categorical coverage exclusions for gender-affirming care, repeal of the 2020 Rule's notice requirements, and alleged violation of Section 1554, in addition to the plaintiffs' constitutional claims. The case is ongoing."}
{"document": "In 2008, the U.S. Department of Justice (Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section) launched an investigation into the treatment of individuals with mental illness in the Delaware Psychiatric Center (DPC), a state hospital.  The investigation was later expanded to assess the state's liability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and its integration mandate under the Supreme Court precedent Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).\n\nOn November 9, 2010, the DOJ issued a findings letter documenting violations of both the ADA and the U.S. Constitution.  DOJ found that, in violation of the ADA, individuals were unnecessarily institutionalized when community placement would be appropriate, and that individuals with mental illness living in the community were placed at risk of unnecessary institutionalization.  DOJ also found \"inadequate risk assessments; inadequate mental health treatment, especially the failure to provide appropriate behavioral interventions for individuals with identified risks; inadequate restraint and seclusion practices; inadequate investigations of serious incidents; and inadequate discharge planning/community integration to ensure individuals live in the most integrated setting.\"\n\nFollowing negotiations, the United States filed a complaint and settlement agreement concurrently in July 2011.  The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Judge Leonard Stark) approved this consent decree on July 15.  As part of the agreement, the state of Delaware agreed to augment its services to keep individuals with mental illness out of institutions, create additional supports, and reform the conditions at DPC to remedy constitutional violations.  Delaware also agreed to create a crisis system to divert individuals from being hospitalized unnecessarily; develop case management and additional community supports; and support integrated housing options.  The agreement was designed to reduce the institutionalized population by half and to replace institution-based services with Medicaid-reimbursable community-based services.\n\nIn accordance with the agreement, a Court Monitor filed reports on the State's progress through 2016. On October 6, 2016, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the case. The parties' brief noted that the State had greatly improved its services for people with serious mental illness; expanded its capacity to deliver those services; and reduced its reliance on segregative institutions. Furthermore, the State had enacted legislation aimed at ensuring it could continue improving its outcomes for people with mental illness absent court supervision. As of that date, the State was in full compliance with the agreement. \n\nAccordingly, on October 11, 2016, Judge Stark dismissed the case.

{"document": "On January 15, 2008, a group of Medicaid-eligible adults with disabilities that were confined to a nursing-home facility filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act against the state's Health Care Administration and Department of Elder Affairs. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest attorneys, asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the state discriminated against them by failing to offer services that would enable them to live in a community setting.\n\nOn June 7, 2008, the Court (Judge Robert L. Hinkle) denied defendants' motion to dismiss. On October 14, 2008, Judge Hinkle certified the class consisting of any Florida Medicaid-eligible adult who, at any time during the litigation, resided in a nursing home that received Medicaid funding, and who could and would have resided in the community with appropriate community-based services. \n\nAt the same time, the judge granted a preliminary injunction with regard to one of the named plaintiffs, Clayton Griffith. Griffith lived in a nursing home, the cost of which was covered by the state's Medicaid program. He had applied for and been determined eligible for a waiver that should have allowed him to live in the community rather than an institution. But the state's long waiting list precluded him from accessing the program. Nevertheless, he moved out of the home and into an apartment. Judge Hinkle entered an injunction ordering the state to provide Griffith Medicaid coverage for a certified nursing assistant. The state appealed the preliminary injunction, which the 11th Circuit affirmed on June 22, 2010.\n\nThe parties cross-moved for summary judgment; the judge denied both motions on January 19, 2011.\n\nAfter a February 2011 bench trial, Judge Hinkle issued an order and opinion on January 3, 2012 that made permanent the injunction regarding Griffith, dismissed the other named plaintiffs' claims as moot, and decertified the class. To start, all but one of the other named plaintiffs had died during the course of litigation; the remaining one had decided to stay in the nursing home. The judge decertified the class in part because the state legislature had passed a new law which greatly improved the rate at which Medicaid-eligible adults were transitioned from nursing homes to community living. Post-legislation, Judge Hinkle reasoned, it was no longer true that the state had refused to act on grounds that applied generally to the class. He concluded that where the conditions that made class-certification appropriate are no longer present, the court has discretion to decertify, which he chose to do.", "summary": "On January 15, 2008, a group of Medicaid-eligible adults with disabilities that were confined to a nursing-home facility filed a class action in U.S. District Court against Florida's Health Care Administration and Department of Elder Affairs.

{"document": "On September 6, 2011, a resident of Florida and applicant for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) assistance filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action against the Florida Department of Children and Families in the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division. The plaintiff, represented by the ACLU of Florida and the Florida Justice Institute, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that Florida's TANF application requirements violated the Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the requirement that all applicants undergo suspicionless drug testing in order to be considered for assistance constituted an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. Judge Mary S. Scriven was assigned to the case.\n\nThe plaintiff moved on September 6, 2011 for a preliminary injunction and on September 13, 2011 for class certification.  The plaintiff proposed a class consisting of all individuals residing in Florida who were applying for, or would in the future apply for, Temporary Cash Assistance (Florida's program to distribute TANF benefits) and who would be subject to defendant's suspicion-less drug testing. Defendant opposed both motions.\n\nOn October 24, 2011, the District Court granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction but denied his motion for class certification. <i>Lebron v. Wilkins<i>, 820 F. Supp. 2d 1273 (M.D. Fla. 2011). The court found that the plaintiff was likely to succeed on his Fourth Amendment claim and issued an injunction that barred the defendant from requiring the plaintiff to take a suspicionless drug test. Since the defendant stipulated that it would apply the court's ruling to all people similarly situated to the plaintiff, the Court found that class certification was unnecessary and dismissed the plaintiff's motion to certify without prejudice.\n\nDefendant appealed the injunction to the Eleventh Circuit. But the Circuit Court (Barkett and Jordan, Circuit Judges, and Hall, District Judge sitting by designation) affirmed the District Court's injunction in an opinion issued on February 26, 2013. See Lebron v. Sec’y, Florida Dep’t of Children & Families, 710 F.3d 1202 (11th Cir. 2013). Defendant petitioned the Eleventh Circuit for a rehearing en banc. Defendant’s petition was denied on April 23, 2013.\n\nOn November 4, 2011, the plaintiff renewed his motion for class certification, arguing that certification would avoid litigation over mootness should the plaintiff find employment. The District Court (Judge Scriven) agreed and certified the class in an order dated December 7, 2011. <i>Lebron v. Wilkins</i>, 277 F.R.D. 664 (M.D. Fla. 2011). The parties continued with preparing for trial. \n\nOn September 10, 2012 the plaintiff filed for Summary Judgment on the grounds that Section 414.0652 of the Florida Statutes, which requires all applicants for TANF benefits to submit to suspicionless drug testing, is not constitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. On the same day, the defendant filed a cross motion for summary judgment, arguing that TANF applicants consent to the drug testing and, even if the consent argument failed, that the State had a special need to drug test applicants. On December 31, 2013, the District Court issued summary judgment for the plaintiff on the grounds that the State had failed to establish a special need to drug test all TANF applicants. In the same judgment the Court declared the statute facially unconstitutional and permanently enjoined the State from reinstating and enforcing the law. \n\nThe defendant appealed the District Courts issuance of Summary Judgment to the Eleventh Circuit. And on December 3, 2014, the Circuit Court (Hull and Marcus, Circuit Judges, and TOTENBERG, District Judge sitting by designation) affirmed the District Court’s decision on the grounds that the State failed to meet its burden of establishing a substantial special need to drug test all TANF applicants without any suspicion of drug use. <i>Lebron v. Secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families</i>, 772 F.3d 1352 (11th Cir. 2014).

{"document": "On July 20, 2004, a lesbian couple living in Florida filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida against the U.S. Attorney General and Clerk for the Circuit and Country Courts of Hillsborough County, Florida, challenging the Federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Florida's implementation of the statute.  Plaintiffs brought their lawsuit after a clerk in the Circuit Court's Office in Hillsborough Country refused to recognize their Massachusetts marriage license. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court to declare DOMA and the corresponding Florida statute unconstitutional and enjoin their enforcement. The plaintiffs alleged that the two statutes violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. \n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that Florida is required to recognize their valid Massachusetts marriage license because DOMA exceeds Congress' power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. They also argued that twelve U.S. Supreme Court Cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), and ending with Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), demonstrate a recent trend by the Supreme Court to expand the fundamental liberty of personal autonomy in connection with one's intimate affairs and family relations. The plaintiffs urged the Court in the case at bar to expand on these cases and find that the right to enter into a same-sex marriage is protected by the Constitution. \n\nOn September 27, 2004, the U.S. filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that DOMA does not infringe on any of the plaintiffs' fundamental rights and is a legitimate exercise of the power granted to Congress by the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  On January 19, 2005, Judge James S. Moody, Jr., granted the defendant's Motion to Dismiss. The Court rejected the plaintiff's interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, saying that Congress' actions are an appropriate exercise of its power to regulate conflicts between the laws of two different States, in this case, conflicts over the validity of same-sex marriage. Florida is not required to recognize or apply Massachusetts' same-sex marriage law because it clearly conflicts with Florida's legitimate public policy of opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Court went on to say that it was bound the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), who dismissed for want of a substantial federal question the appeal of Minnesota's Supreme Court ruling that the right to marry without regard to the sex of the parties is not a fundamental right of all persons (and thus a similar state statute to the one in the case at bar did not violate the Due Process Clause or Equal Protection Clause). \n\nRegarding Due Process, the Court said the Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence only determined that a Texas statute prohibiting homosexual sodomy failed under the rational basis analysis, and in no way can be interpreted as creating a fundamental right to same-sex marriage. The Court also expressed its reservations about elevating rights to fundamental status, since to do so would remove policy decisions from the hands of the people and into the guardianship of unelected judges. Willams v. Pryor, 378 F.3d 1232, 1250. Therefore, the Court found that the right to marry a person of the same sex is not a fundamental right under the Constitution.\n\nOn the issue of Equal Protection, the Court stated that the Eleventh Circuit has held that homosexuality is not a suspect class that would require subjecting DOMA to strict scrutiny, Lofton v. Sec. of Dept. of Children and Family Servs., 358 F.3d 804, 818 (11th Cir. 2004), and that DOMA does not discriminate on the basis of sex because it treats women and men equally, In re Kandu, 315 B.R. 123, 143 (W.D. Wash. 2004), and therefore it must apply rational basis review. The Court held that encouraging the raising of children in homes consisting of a married mother and father is a legitimate state interest, See Lofton, 358 F.3d at 819-20, and DOMA is rationally related to this interest. \n\nOn March 7, 2005, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the remainder of the case (involving the State of Florida) and the case was closed on March 8, 2005.", "summary": "Plaintiffs were a lesbian couple who filed a complaint on July 20, 2004 challenging the Federal Defense of Marriage Act, as well as Florida's implementation of the statute, as violating the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and sought declaratory relief.  On January 19, 2005, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida held that DOMA falls within Congress' power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the right to same-sex marriage is not a fundamental right under the Constitution, and that DOMA passes the rational basis review test and does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  The Court dismissed the case.  "}
{"document": "This case emerged from <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12503\">Haddad v. Arnold</a>. With slightly differing facts from others in the proposed class in Haddad, plaintiffs Luis Cruz and Nigel de la Torre filed this separate complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on April 15, 2011.  The plaintiffs have spinal cord injuries that caused quadriplegia. Both have paralysis, use a wheelchair for mobility, and require assistance in their homes in order to perform daily life activities. Although both plaintiffs receive some in-home nursing through Medicaid, this is insufficient to meet their needs (about 2 hours a day of care). They are both on the waitlist for Florida Medicaid's traumatic brain and spinal cord injury waiver services, and the state administrators have responded negatively to their inquiries, indicating limitations in the program that would prevent the plaintiffs from receiving waiver services in the foreseeable future. The plaintiffs argued that this placed them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization and thus violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (under the precedent Olmstead v. L.C.) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \n\nFollowing a Report and Recommendation from Magistrate Judge Andrea Simonton, District Court Judge Ursula Ungaro granted the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction on November 24, 2010, finding that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and that they stood to suffer irreparable harm without waiver services. The injunction ordered the state to provide such services.\n\nWith waiver services in place for the plaintiffs, the parties agreed to dismiss the case on April 15, 2011. The case was reopened for the purpose of determining attorney's fees and the parties litigated this issue for a year, with a Magistrate Judge finding in favor of the plaintiffs and awarding fees in February 2012.

{"document": "Represented by Disability Rights Florida (the Protection & Advocacy Agency for Florida), individuals with developmental disabilities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida on March 23, 2011, challenging their continued placement on the waitlist for Florida's developmental disability Medicaid waiver services.  Some of the plaintiffs lived in the community but alleged that the state's inability to provide them with services via the waiver would put them at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. Other plaintiffs resided in ICF/DD institutions (intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled) but claimed that they could live in the community if the state provided them with waiver services.  The plaintiffs allege that the state's current policy of only allowing limited waiver enrollment for individuals deemed \"in crisis\" violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Medicaid. \n\nThe Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, but the court (Judge Richard Smoak) denied the motion on August 30, 2011.  The plaintiffs then filed a motion for class certification.  On October 14, 2011, Judge Smoak denied the motion for class certification, finding that the institutionalized plaintiffs and the non-institutionalized plaintiffs did not sufficiently share interests. In fact, they would probably compete with each other for enrollment slots if any opened up on the DD Waiver.  Institutionalized plaintiffs will necessarily never reach the point of being in \"crisis\" (and are thus categorically prevented from enrollment under the current policies), but plaintiffs in the community could possibly get off the waitlist if their lack of sufficient services caused a crisis situation.  Because Disability Rights Florida, as the state Protection and Advocacy Agency, has organizational standing to sue on behalf of individuals with disabilities, however, the case was able to proceed. \n\nDiscovery continued, and the parties litigated the issue of standing for some of the plaintiffs whose status had changed throughout the course of the lawsuit. In July 2012, the parties entered a private settlement agreement and agreed to dismiss the lawsuit. \n\nThe settlement agreement contained a few separate provisions. First, the Florida legislature had recently included a budget proviso requiring funds to be made available to transfer individuals from ICF/DD placement to the DD waiver.  The Agency for Healthcare Administration will request this budget proviso in future years. The state also agreed to expedite the enrollment of individuals deemed in crisis, and to provide employment support services. Finally, the state will create a DD Waiver working group and will include stakeholders representing the disability community.

As a result of this change, each plaintiff was given a notice that he or she would be terminated from the program. The Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on September 10, 2010, alleging that the reduction in coverage placed the Plaintiffs at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

The plaintiff, represented by attorneys from the Georgia Advocacy Office, sought temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant violated his rights and due process in their procedure for deciding how many hours of private duty nursing hours he would receive.\n\nOn September 9, 2008, the district court (Judge Thomas W. Thrash Jr.) granted a temporary restraining order compelling the defendants to provide all hours of private duty nursing that the plaintiff's treating physician had requested (168 hours/week). On November 3rd, the court (Judge Thrash) granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the defendants from enforcing any of their policies that would limit or reduce the number of private duty nursing hours a patient could receive that were not based on medical necessity. The injunction also decreased the number of hours of nursing the plaintiff received based on a schedule created by a physician working for the defendant.\n\nFollowing a surgical operation, plaintiff required increased nursing hours and filed for a second temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.

This final complaint reaffirmed the allegations from the first while adding a Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment cause for action, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA) prohibition on policies that have the discriminatory effect of segregating individuals with disabilities from the general population. Plaintiffs argued that the non-medically based denial of private, in-home nursing care will lead to the institutionalization, and thus segregation, of the plaintiffs. <i>See Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring</i>, 527 U.S. 581 (1999).\n\nThe district court (Judge Thrash) granted a motion on behalf of the only plaintiff who was eighteen years old for a temporary restraining order compelling the defendants to provide the nursing care requested by a treating physician.  On June 15, 2012, the court entered an order and opinion granting a permanent injunction that extended the effect of that restraining order. The defendant initially appealed this decision but it was voluntarily dismissed.\n\nOn August 2, 2012, the court denied the plaintiff's motion to certify the class because the plaintiffs failed to provide any evidence that indicated how many people would be able to make the same allegations against the defendant.\n\nThe defendant filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 30, 2013, claiming that the plaintiffs had not provided enough evidence to prove their allegations regarding the Medicare Act, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the ADA.  The United States filed a brief as an interested party hoping to clarify the law regarding the ADA claim, urging the District Court to deny the motion for partial summary judgment.  On May 22, 2013, the court issued an order granting the motion for partial summary judgment as it pertained to some elements of the Medicare Act claim as well as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment claims.  The court denied the motion with regard to other Medicare Act allegations in addition to the ADA claim.\n\nOn August 5, 2013, the defendants offered the four remaining defendants a settlement consisting of individual nursing care plans and admitting no fault.

The named plaintiffs were minor Medicaid recipients with serious disabilities who had been receiving medically-necessary therapies, paid for by the State's Medicaid program and administered by the FSAA. The FSSA had denied the named plaintiffs and others similarly situated individuals continued access to these therapies. It cited two provisions of the Indiana Administrative Code, one of which limited the provisions of these therapies to two years unless patients demonstrated significant progress to a \"higher functional state,\" and the other which generally prohibited all \"maintenance therapies,\" i.e. therapies designed to prevent deterioration rather than improve a patient's condition.

The FSSA had denied the named plaintiffs and others similarly situated continuing access to these therapies, citing two provisions of the Indiana Administrative Code. On February 10, 2011, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs, issuing a permanent injunction preventing the Defendants and their successors from limiting or denying coverage for prescribed physical, occupational, or respiratory therapy, and/or speech pathology, for any person under 21 enrolled in the State's Medicaid program when such denial or limitation was based upon the two disputed provisions."}
{"document": "On March 28, 2018 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Prince George’s County, Maryland filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Census Bureau, the Secretary of Commerce, and the President of the United States for “conspicuous neglect” of their duty to ensure the “actual enumeration” required by Article I of the U.S. Constitution.  The case was assigned to Judge Paul W. Grimm.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that this neglect had led to undercounting in the past, and would lead to higher undercounting in the 2020 Census, particularly affecting disadvantaged and minority populations. Prince George’s County alleged that its population had been undercounted by 1.9% in 2000 and 2.3% in 2010.  These undercounts impacted redistricting, distribution of public funds, and apportionment of representation in the U.S. House of Representatives.  The plaintiffs claimed that the 2010 Census undercounted African Americans by roughly 1.5 million, while overcounting other demographic groups such as home owners and non-Hispanic whites. \n\nCensus design flaws, underfunding, and lack of staff and leadership, together with Prince George’s County’s demographics and history of being undercounted, suggested a likelihood that the detrimental effects of undercounting were likely to be exacerbated for the county in the 2020 Census.  For example, whereas the Bureau’s budget has typically grown with each successive Census, it has decreased from $4.2 billion in 2010 to $3.9 billion in 2020.  Moreover, the plaintiffs claimed that the plan to administer more of the Census digitally would lead to undercounting for areas with little broadband access, and leave the Census open to cyber attacks. \n\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the government had an obligation to administer a fair and accurate census, and to enjoin the government from violating that duty. Moreover, the plaintiffs requested that the court issue an injunction requiring the government to propose and implement a policy that ensures a hard count subject to court monitoring.\n\nThe plaintiffs subsequently filed two amended complaints adding the parties’ addresses. The government moved to dismiss on July 13, 2018, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing, the claim was not ripe, the decision constituted a political question beyond judicial review, and that the Enumeration Clause required only that the government conduct a person-by-person headcount of the population. The plaintiffs responded a month later. They argued that they had standing, citing the specific injury of a “severe differential undercount” resulting in vote dilution and loss of federal funding. On ripeness, the plaintiffs claimed to be at imminent risk of harm, and waiting until the census began would leave them without remedy.  Against the government’s claim of unreviewable discretion in conducting the census, the plaintiffs cited decades of census-related litigation.  In November 2018, the plaintiffs submitted a supplemental notice of Judge George Hazel’s recent ruling in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16610\"><i>La Unión del Pueblo Entero v. Ross</i></a>, a similar case in the District of Maryland, rejecting government arguments in a similar motion to dismiss.\n\nThe court set a hearing for January 14, 2019.  However, the government moved to continue the hearing in light of the government shutdown and resulting lapse in appropriations. The plaintiffs opposed the motion, as the census count would occur in just over a year, and other courts had refused to delay ongoing census litigation for the same reason. They argued that the shutdown would disrupt census preparations, leading to further inaccurate results. The court denied the motion to continue the hearing, finding that the case involved the protection of property, that the shutdown supported the plaintiff’s argument that the government would not be prepared to conduct an accurate census in 2020, and that this type of motion has been denied in similar pending cases.\n\nThe court ruled on January 29, 2019, granting in part the motion to dismiss. 382 F. Supp. 3d 349. The court noted this case was unique from other pending census litigation, as this suit did not include a challenge to final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. Instead, it challenged the agency’s action before it had finalized the 2020 Census preparations. The court thus denied without prejudice the request for injunctive relief, finding this claim not yet ripe because preparations were ongoing. However, the court recognized the potential for declaratory relief to ensure sufficient funds for census preparations, found that the plaintiffs had standing on this claim, and allowed this claim to proceed.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, the court allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, adding a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act, but not allowing a restatement of the Enumeration Clause claim.  The government moved to dismiss the amended claims.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on April 1, 2019. This complaint, among other things, removed President Donald Trump as a defendant. On April 15, 2019, the government filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. This motion to dismiss was granted on August 1, 2019.  The court found that “the 2019 Appropriations Act moots the funding claim,” and “the Final Operational Plan is not final agency action” reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act.  399 F.Supp.3d 406\n\nOn August 6, 2019, the plaintiffs appealed. Oral argument was heard on October 30, 2019, and the Fourth Circuit (Judges Roger Gregory, Barbara Keenan, and Julius Richardson) issued its opinion on December 19, 2019.  It agreed with the district court that “plaintiffs’ APA claims, as pleaded, do not satisfy the jurisdictional limitations on judicial review set forth in the APA.”  It disagreed, however, with the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’ Enumeration Clause claim, “mindful of the Supreme Court’s recent guidance affirming judicial review of ‘both constitutional and statutory challenges to census-related decisionmaking,’ <i>Dept’t of Commerce v. New York</i>.”  The Fourth Circuit remanded that portion of the case to the district court.  945 F.3d 183.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on January 10, 2020. In addition, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction on January 21, 2020,  asking the court to compel the government to expend 2020 Census funds in specified ways. On February 11, 2020, the government sought to dismiss the case, and sought summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \n\nOn March 5, 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  The court held, among other things, that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the government had “refused to spend the appropriations from Congress in the specific manner that Congress directed,” and “if the census proceeds as planned, there will be a differential undercount of the magnitude they fear, or that if [the court] were to order the funds spent as they want, the 2020 census would not produce an equal or worse undercount for hard-to-count communities.” \n\nIn addition, the court granted the government’s motion to dismiss, on April 16, 2020. The court held that the plaintiffs did not “plausibly allege that the Census Bureau’s plan fails to bear a reasonable relationship to an actual enumeration or that any of the Census Bureau’s actions unreasonably compromise the distributive accuracy of the census.”  As such, the court ruled the remaining motions moot, and directed the clerk to close the case.  2020 WL 1890531.\n\nThe case is closed.

The plaintiffs alleged that underfunding and the flawed design of the 2020 Census might lead to undercounts of the US population in violation of the Enumeration Clause and to the detriment of minority populations, as the census count is tied to both public funding and governmental representation. The plaintiffs requested an injunction to require the US to develop a plan to ensure a fair and accurate count. The court dismissed the claim for injunctive relief as unripe because census preparations were ongoing, but allowed the claim on underfunding to continue. The court also allowed the plaintiffs to add two claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. On April 16, 2020, the court granted the government’s motion to dismiss; the case is closed. "}
{"document": "On December 18, 2009, plaintiffs, three Medicaid recipients diagnosed with cerebral palsy, filed a lawsuit against the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services in her official capacity (DHHS). The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maine and sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Disability Rights Center, Maine Equal Justice Partners, and the National Health Law Program, alleged that DHHS had violated the Nursing Home Reform Amendments to the federal Medicaid Act (NHRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e); Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), 29 U.S.C. § 794. The plaintiffs alleged that DHS had failed to accommodate plaintiffs' disabilities and to provide medically necessary treatment in the most integrated setting possible, as required by the ADA, Section 504, and other federal law, and instead forced them into nursing homes where they were functionally segregated from the outside world. \n\nPlaintiffs claimed that they did not require intensive nursing care, and that with appropriate personal care and assistance, they all would be able to live in independently. In addition, none of the plaintiffs had ever been evaluated for or received individualized services appropriate to their needs during their confinement in the nursing facilities, contrary to the NHRA. Plaintiffs sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and declaratory relief, seeking to be placed in integrated, community settings such as their own apartments or houses, or small group homes located in the general community, or, if it was determined that their medical conditions were severe enough that they actually required treatment in nursing facilities, that they receive the personalized care required by the NHRA. They also sought litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\nOn August 10, 2010, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, seeking to make the suit a class action. On August 11, 2010, the Court granted the motion, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint immediately, defining the putative class as \"[all] Maine residents who currently are or in the future will be: (1) eligible for and enrolled in [the State's Medicaid program], (2) age 21 or older, (3) have [cerebral palsy, epilepsy, or a condition closely related to intellectual disabilities as defined by federal regulation 42 C.F.R. § 435.1010, not including mental illness, autism, Alzheimer's, or dementia], and (4) who are or should be screened for admission to nursing facilities pursuant to 42. U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7) and 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.112 et seq.2.\" According to the amended complaint, more than 48 individuals had been identified as meeting this definition.

The amended complaint sought injunctions requiring that all class members be promptly screened and provided with personalized services as required by the NHRA, and also screened for eligibility for community-based services, and, where appropriate, transferred from nursing homes to community settings. They continued to seek declaratory relief and costs, as well.\n\nThe parties began settlement discussions shortly thereafter. On August 25, 2011, the parties filed a joint motion seeking approval of their settlement, and a fairness hearing was held on April 24, 2012. On May 2, 2012, the Court (Judge Nancy Torresen) approved the settlement, dismissing the case with prejudice, retaining the level of jurisdiction required to enforce its terms for three years from the effective date of the settlement.\n\nThe settlement agreement required the DHS to establish a Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW) program, which would provide a limited number of qualifying class-members the opportunity to live in community-based settings, providing them with \"home supports; community supports; employment specialist services; work supports; home accessibility adaptations; communication aids; transportation services; assistive technology; consultation services and assessments; counseling and crisis services; maintenance occupational, physical and speech therapy; [and] case management and specialized medical equipment to the extent that those services are subject to federal financial participation under the Medicaid program.\" DHS would allow fifteen class members to opt into the HCBW program in the first year, and add an additional ten spaces in the program each year, until the program reached its maximum size of 75 class members. The settlement indicated that the parties would prefer that the HCBW program be established as soon as possible, but acknowledged that the federal government might require the DHS first establish Intermediate Care Facilities for Other Related Conditions (ICFs-ORC) before accepting its proposal for an HCBW. The parties agreed that if ICFs-ORC were determined to be necessary, the parties would return enter mediation to determine an appropriate extension of the court's jurisdiction over the case.\n\nDHS also agreed to provide the Preadmission Screening and Annual Resident Review (PASARR) and personalized care required by the NHRA.\n\nIt appears both parties bore their own costs.\n\nOn July 16, 2013, the plaintiffs' filed a motion for mediation, seeking the Court's assistance resolving disputes relating to the PASARR program.

{"document": "In July 2011, a group of minor children with developmental disabilities filed this civil rights class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina to prevent reductions in Medicaid waiver services. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) and Piedmont Behavioral Healthcare (PBH). The plaintiffs had received home-based Medicaid-funded services through the North Carolina \"Innovations Waiver.\" On July 1, 2011, it was announced that the plaintiffs' services would be reduced because Piedmont Behavioral Health (PBH), a contractor of the state health department, implemented a new system to determine which services were \"medically necessary.\" The plaintiffs claimed that although their medical conditions remained constant, essential health services had been unreasonably and arbitrarily reduced by PBH's \"Support Needs Matrix\" and that they had not been offered an avenue to appeal their service reductions. They alleged that some plaintiffs would be threatened with placement in institutional settings far from their communities if the services needed to remain at home were not reinstated. According to the plaintiffs, this new reduction of services violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of due process and the federal Medicaid statute. They requested class certification, declaratory relief, preliminary relief, permanent injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed for class certification and for a preliminary injunction on August 29, 2011. After a period of discovery and a controversy regarding the disqualification of counsel and a motion to intervene, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order on December 20, 2011. District Judge Louise Wood Flanagan denied this motion on December 28, 2011, but noted that the motion for preliminary injunctive relief was still pending. After resolving the disqualification issue, the court held a hearing on the motion for preliminary relief in March 2012. On March 29, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion and certified the class. The court found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, in part because federal Medicaid provides that adequate notice and a fair hearing process be made available before denying benefits, and there was no notice or available appeal here. Such a process is also required by the Constitution and the plaintiffs had also demonstrated irreparable harm.  \n\nPBH appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court's decision on May 10, 2013. K.C. ex rel. Africa H. v. Shipman, 716 F.3d 107 (4th Cir. 2013). The Fourth Circuit held that it was speculative at best whether a decision in the appeal would enable PBH to engage in the conduct that the District Court enjoined. The Court explained that, because the NCDHHS had not appealed the grant of the preliminary injunction, the NCDHHS would remain obligated to obey the injunction, thus making PBH bound to comply with the injunction regardless of any appellate decision. The Court cited two reasons why PBH would still be required to follow the injunction. First, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d)(2) requires that any injunction binding named parties also binds the parties' agents. Because PBH was an agent of the NCDHHS due to its contract to administer plaintiffs’ Medicaid services on behalf of the state, it would be bound to follow the injunction under Rule 65(d)(2). Second, the Medicaid statute requires each state to designate a single state agency to administer its Medicaid plan, which is the NCDHHS in this case. Therefore, the NCDHHS's decision not to appeal the preliminary injunction controls. \n\nFollowing the Fourth Circuit's decision in May 2013, the parties engaged in extensive efforts to reach a settlement agreement. On December 12, 2014, the parties submitted a settlement agreement to the court for preliminary approval, notice to class members, scheduling of a fairness hearing, and clarification of the class definition. On January 2, 2015, the court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement agreement pending an opportunity for class members to object. Following a fairness hearing, the court approved the settlement agreement on April 6, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the court dismissed the action with prejudice on December 31, 2015.\n\nThe settlement agreement provided for improved notification and grievance-filing procedures with respect to changes or reductions in services. Additionally, the defendants agreed not to reduce any participant's base budget for one year after the implementation of the agreement and before dismissal of the case. For the two-year period following dismissal of the case, the defendants agreed to notify participants of any base budget reduction. The agreement also provided for increased procedural protections for individuals requesting an authorization of services. The defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs $375,000 for attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs incurred during the litigation. \n\nThe agreement remained in effect for a two-year monitoring period following the dismissal of the case in December 2015.

{"document": "On March 29, 2018, four transgender people seeking to correct their Ohio birth certificates to accurately reflect their gender identity filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (in Columbus). The plaintiffs sued the Director of the Ohio Department of Health under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by the ACLU and Lambda Legal, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Michael H. Watson.\n\nThe plaintiffs wished to change their birth certificates to avoid discrimination, privacy invasions, harassment, humiliation, stigma, harm to their health, and violence. They claimed that, in barring transgender people from obtaining accurate birth certificates matching their gender identity, the Department of Health had violated federal constitutional guarantees, including the rights to equal protection, due process, and freedom from compelled speech. On April 5, 2018, the court granted a request by the plaintiffs to proceed pseudonymously and a protective order to be referred to pseudonymously in court documents. (2018 WL 8804858).\n\nOn July 6, 2018, the state filed a motion to dismiss due to failure to state a claim, arguing that the plaintiffs did not state a true violation of the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, Ohio argued that birth certificates purely express sex and not gender identity under Ohio statutes; that the plaintiffs failed to properly state a claim of due process violation; and that preventing birth certificate changes served state interests. \n\nOn July 21, 2018, Ohio filed a motion to stay discovery until their motion to dismiss had been resolved. The state argued that the plaintiffs were already serving overly broad discovery requests at the expense of taxpayer money for a case that was primarily legal in nature, despite the fact that a successful motion to dismiss would resolve most actions in this case. The state argued that in the interests of saving resources, a stay of discovery should be ordered until a decision on their motion had been finalized.\n\nOn October 10, 2018, the district court denied the state's motion to stay discovery, citing that a “garden-variety” motion to dismiss, was not sufficient grounds to stay discovery. (2018 WL 4907080). Nearly a year later, on September 12, 2019, the judge denied the motion to dismiss. Specifically, the judge found that Ohio statutes were not clear on whether a transgender individual could obtain a birth certificate change, violations of due process were properly alleged, and that the argument that preventing birth certificate changes served a state interest lacked merit. (2019 WL 11791719)\n\nBoth sides moved for summary judgment on January 16, 2020. On December 16, 2020, Judge Watson granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied the government's; Judge Watson based this on a logical disconnect between Ohio’s stated reasons for denying the documentation (historical accuracy and preventing fraud) and the fact that the state had, as recently as 2016, allowed transgender people to change the sex marker on state documents.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is an ongoing lawsuit regarding Ohio state legislation that would criminalize certain abortions that was amended to include a request for relief in light of COVID-19. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order against the Department of Health's order which had banned all \"non-essential surgeries and procedures\" starting on March 18. The judge granted the temporary restraining order for a period of 14 days, which was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit on April 6. The judge granted a preliminary injunction on April 23, which allowed abortions in situations where a medical provider determined that a delay would not be possible. <hr>\n\nOn May 15, 2019 the plaintiffs, for-profit and non-profit providers of medical and surgical abortions in Ohio and their doctors, filed an initial complaint in the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the Ohio State Department of Health, the State Medical Board of Ohio, and various county prosecutors. They contested the Ohio State Legislature's 6-week abortion ban, passed on April 10 of that year. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Ohio and the Planned Parenthood Foundation, sought a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and costs under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 28 U.S.C. 2201.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Ohio S.B. 23, which would criminalize all abortions in which a fetal heartbeat can be detected (six weeks) except in cases that would jeopardize the health of the mother, would practically eliminate abortion in Ohio, because it often takes women longer than six weeks to determine that they are pregnant. They claimed that this violated the substantive due process precedent outlined in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.\n\nOn May 24, the court related another case <i>Preterm Cleveland v. Himes</i>, but determined that each case should remain with its assigned judge.\n\nJudge Michael R. Barrett granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction on July 3, 2019 (394 F.Supp.3d 796), in advance of the statute's effective date of July 11. He stated that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits and enacting the ban would cause irreparable harm to Ohio women. Following this, the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on August 20, 2019.\n\nBoth parties filed motions and answers surrounding the motion for judgment on the pleadings until the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 30, 2020, in response to the Ohio Department of Health's March 17 order. The order banned all \"non-essential surgeries and procedures\" to preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) starting on March 18 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs alleged that surgical abortions do not use a significant amount of PPE and that surgical abortions might be the only option for patients that are allergic to medical abortion pills. They also claimed that forcing patients to wait until the pandemic passed would not be sufficient, since abortion is a time-sensitive procedure. The order estimated the potential delay to be about eight weeks at minimum, but the order banning elective procedures was expected to possibly last up to a year. The complaint also added an equal protection claim that abortion providers were unfairly being singled out in comparison to other businesses. The plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Health order and they sought the same relief requested in the initial complaint.\n\nJudge Barrett granted the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order against the Department of Health order on the same day (2020 WL 1932851). This temporary restraining order lasted for 14 days and was limited to situations where a medical provider decided that delaying a surgical abortion until after the pandemic subsided would not be possible. He denied a motion to stay the temporary restraining order filed by the defendants on April 2 (2020 WL 1932492).\n\nThe defendants filed an interlocutory appeal contesting the temporary restraining order on April 1. A Sixth Circuit panel, composed of Chief Judge R. Guy Cole and Judges Ralph B. Guy and John K. Bush declined to reverse the temporary restraining order on April 6 (2020 WL 1673310), saying that the narrow tailoring of the restraining order meant that not many abortions would be performed and PPE supplies would not be diminished. They stressed that the time sensitive nature of abortions justified this protection.\n\nIn order to preserve the status quo before ruling on the preliminary injunction, Judge Barrett extended the temporary restraining order for an additional two weeks on April 10, 2020 (2020 WL 1932540). Judge Barrett granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction on April 23, 2020 (2020 WL 1957173). He noted that, while he did not want unnecessary medical procedures being performed in Ohio, waiting to have an abortion was not an option in certain circumstances. He limited the bounds of the preliminary injunction to situations where a medical provider determined that a delay would not be possible.\n\nThe case is ongoing.", "summary": "On May 15, 2019 the plaintiffs, for-profit and non-profit providers of medical and surgical abortions in Ohio and their doctors, filed an initial complaint in the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the Ohio State Department of Health, the State Medical Board of Ohio, and various county prosecutors contesting the Ohio State Legislature's 6-week abortion ban, passed on April 10 of that year.

The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and sought a declaration that Oregon laws banning same-sex marriage were unconstitutional, a permanent injunction requiring the state to grant to same-sex couples the same full and equal recognition, rights, and privileges given to different-sex couples and recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages, and an award of costs of suit and reasonable attorneys' fees. \n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that by prohibiting residents from entering into a same-sex marriage, and by refusing to recognize legal same-sex marriages that took place out-of-state, the state of Oregon was violating the plaintiffs' constitutional rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.

The plaintiffs included both same-sex couples with valid out-of-state marriage licenses and same-sex couples seeking to get married in South Dakota. Represented by private counsel, they sought a declaratory judgment that South Dakota's constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage violated their rights to equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as well as their right to travel. The plaintiffs also sought a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing the state's same-sex marriage bans or from declining to issue a marriage license because the applicants were of the same sex. \n \nOn November 14, 2014, the District Court (Judge Karen E. Schreier), on defendant's motion, dismissed the plaintiffs' right-to-travel claim. The plaintiffs had argued that South Dakota's same-sex marriage ban violated their right to travel by creating two Americas: one group of states where plaintiffs could travel and enjoy the protections that come with marriage and another group of states (including South Dakota) where they couldn't travel without being stripped of their marital status and accompanying legal protections. The District Court (Judge Karen E. Schreier) rejected this argument; the burden that plaintiffs identified applied equally to new and existing citizens of South Dakota and was dissimilar to cases in which a violation of the right to travel was found. 61 F.Supp.3d 845.\n \nOn January 12, 2015, the District Court (Judge Karen E. Schreier) held that South Dakota's same-sex marriage bans violated the Constitution, granting the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Over the plaintiffs' objections, however, the court stayed the effects of the judgment pending appeal, citing the substantial and novel legal questions at stake.  Thus, unlike in many states, no same-sex marriages occurred in South Dakota. 61 F.Supp.3d 862.\n \nOn January 26, 2015, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

On March 2, 2015, Judge Schreier denied this motion. She concluded that once the defendants filed their notice of appeal, jurisdiction over most issues in the case, including the stay, were transferred to the Court of Appeals. Therefore, the plaintiffs could file their motion to vacate the stay only in the Eighth Circuit, not in the district court. \n\nThe Eighth Circuit ordered on April 29, 2015 that they would defer consideration of this case, pending the expected June 2015 resolution in the Supreme Court of <i>Obergefell v.

Hodges</i> did not render this case moot, and affirmed the District Court's decision in favor of the plaintiffs. Although South Dakota made assurances of complying with the Court's ruling in <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i>, the Eighth Circuit held that the assurances did not rendered the case moot. However, the Court did hold that the assurances may have had an impact on the necessity of the injunctive relief previously granted to the plaintiffs, but denied the current motion pending by plaintiffs, leaving that discretion to the District Court. 799 F.3d 918.\n\nBack in District Court on September 9, 2015, Judge Schreier granted the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the stay in light of the mandate from the Eighth Circuit.

The Plaintiffs alleged that Texas failed to provide adequate habilitation and support services in the community that would allow them to avoid institutionalization or transition out of institutions. They alleged that individuals with developmental disabilities must enter institutions in order to receive necessary services in Texas.  Furthermore, the Plaintiffs claimed that the state systematically violated a provision of the Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA) known as Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR), which would divert individuals slated to enter nursing facilities into community placements if institutionalization was deemed unnecessary.

Furthermore, Judge O'Connor found that the putative intervenors could not intervene as of right then because it was yet unclear whether the defendants would adequately represent the putative intervenors' interests; he deferred ruling on the putative intervenors request for permissive intervention. \n\nOn January 30, 2017, the putative intervenors filed an interlocutory appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On June 30, 2017, a panel of the Fifth Circuit, per curiam, dismissed the appeal because the district court had not ruled on the putative intervenors' motion for permissive intervention and therefore had not conclusively resolved the intervention issue.\n\nOn May 2, 2017, while the putative intervenors' appeal to the Fifth Circuit was pending, the defendants filed a motion for voluntary remand and stay, arguing that HHS should be given the opportunity to reconsider the regulation at issue in this case, which would conserve the resources of both parties and the court. On July 10, 2017, Judge O'Connor declined to remand the case, but imposed a stay of all proceedings while HHS reconsidered the regulation. He also ordered the defendants to file a status report on or before August 4, 2017, identifying any rulemaking proceedings initiated with respect to the challenged regulation. Furthermore, he clarified that the December 31, 2016, preliminary injunction order would be unaffected by the stay and would remain in full force and effect throughout the stay.\n\nOn August 4, 2017, the defendants filed a status report indicating that \"a draft of a proposed rule is going through the clearance process within the Executive Branch.\" On August 16, 2017, Judge O'Connor ordered the defendants to file another status report on or before October 16, 2017, and every 60 days thereafter. After multiple additional status reports, the parties filed a joint motion to lift the stay on December 17, 2018, which Judge O'Connor granted. \n\nThe parties resumed litigating the case, with the ACLU of Texas and River City Gender Alliance renewing their motion to intervene on February 1, 2019 and the plaintiffs renewing their motions for summary judgment on February 4. On March 21, 2019, the plaintiff State of Wisconsin requested an order from the court dismissing it from the case because it \"no longer has an interest in pursuing its claims.\" Litigation among the remaining parties continued. \n\nHHS filed a notice of proposed rule-making that proposed to amend the HHS regulations implementing Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 42 U.S.C. § 18116. Shortly after, defendants filed a motion on May 31, 2019 renewing their request that the Court postpone ruling on Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motions to allow HHS to amend the regulations. They argued that, \"the proposed rule, if finalized in relevant part, would likely moot this case and Plaintiffs will not be harmed in the interim because the relevant parts of the current regulations are presently enjoined nationwide.\" The notice would not include a definition of \"sex\" for purposes of discrimination on the basis of sex in the regulation, but instead incorporates the meaning as defined by Title IX. \n\nAfter a motion hearing on September 16, 2019, Judge O'Connor issued an opinion on October 15, 2019 that: 1) granted the ACLU of Texas and the River City Gender Alliance's motion to intervene; 2) Granted in part plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment and permanent injunction; 3) Severed plaintiffs' APA and RFRA claims from their Title VII, Spending Clause, First Amendment, Tenth Amendment, and Eleventh Amendment claims; 4) Adopted the reasoning from the December 31, 2016 order granting preliminary injunction in holding that the Rule violates the APA and RFRA. The court vacated and remanded the rule for further consideration. 414 F. Supp. 3d 928. The court later went on to amend the judgment on November 21, clarifying that only the portion of the rule challenged in this litigation was vacated and remanded. \n\nOn January 21, 2020, the plaintiffs appealed the October 15 ruling to the Fifth Circuit, challenging the order granting in part and denying in part the motion for summary judgment. Additionally, they challenged the November 21 amendment to the judgment. \n\nAs of May 29, 2020, the case is ongoing in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

{"document": "On August 1, 2013, two same-sex couples filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia against the state of Virginia, under 42 U.S. § 1983 and the Declaratory Judgment Act. The plaintiffs, represented by the national ACLU, the ACLU of Virginia, Lambda Legal and private counsel, asked the court for both declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the state's refusal to allow same-sex couples to marry or to recognize same-sex couples married in other states violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The suit was filed just over a month after the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11970\">Perry v. Hollingsworth</a>.\n\nOn August 16, 2013, the plaintiffs moved for class certification of same-sex couples under F.R.C.P. 23(b)(2). On the same day, the Robert McDonnell, the Governor of Virginia, moved to dismiss the case on grounds of sovereign immunity. On August 30, 2013, defendant Thomas Roberts moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The court (Judge Michael F. Urbanski) held a motion hearing on October 29, 2013 on these matters.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on September 30, 2013. On October 3, 2013 the State defendants filed a motion to stay the proceedings until an earlier case involving the same issues, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12807&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseName%7Cbostic%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B\">Bostic v. Rainey</a>, resolved cross-motions for summary judgment. In an opinion dated October 18, 2013, Judge Urbanski denied defendants' motion to stay the proceedings, but allowed the defendants additional time to file their summary judgment response; defendants filed that response on November 7, 2013. \n\nOn December 23, 2013, Judge Urbanski granted the motion to dismiss Governor McDonnell on sovereign immunity grounds, but denied Defendant Thomas Roberts's motion to dismiss. 988 F.Supp.2d 603 (W.D. Va. 2013). The case moved forward as Harris v. Rainey after the dismissal of Governor McDonnell.\n\nOn Jan. 31, 2014, Judge Urbanski certified this suit as a class action, with two classes: (1) all same-sex couples in Virginia who have not married in another jurisdiction, and (2) all same-sex couples in Virginia who have married in another jurisdiction.  \n\nWhile this case proceeded towards its own resolution, on February 13, 2014, in the Bostic case, the District Court (Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen) granted summary judgment and a preliminary injunction for the plaintiff, and entered an order enjoining Virginia from continuing to enforce the marriage ban.  In addition, defendant M. Rainey, the State Registrar of Vital Records, shifted position in this case (as in Bostic).  She had originally argued that Virginia's same-sex marriage ban was constitutional.  But in January Virginia's Attorney General decided not to defend the ban.  The other defendant here, the Clerk of the Staunton Circuit Court, likewise changed his position, which had been in support of the laws--he then declined to take a position on their constitutionality.  \n\nThe Bostic case proceeded towards resolution in the appellate court, on an expedited briefing schedule.  On March 10, 2014, the Fourth Circuit allowed these plaintiffs to intervene on the side of the plaintiffs-appellees and file their own briefs in Bostic, set to be heard in May 2014.  Accordingly, in this case, Judge Urbanski ruled on March 31, 2014 to stay the proceedings pending the Fourth Circuit's decision in Bostic.  \n\nOn July 28, 2014 the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling in Bostic, agreeing with the district court that the same-sex marriage ban violated the Constitution. The majority opinion, by Judge Henry Floyd, found that the ban impermissibly infringed upon Virginians' fundamental right to marry. A dissent by Judge Paul Niemeyer said that the state had a right to define marriage as relationships between one man and one woman. 760 F.3d 352.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted a stay to the Fourth Circuit's Bostic mandate on August 20, 2014, pending their decision on the defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari. However, the Supreme Court later denied writ on October 4, 2014. Same sex couples were then allowed to wed in Virginia. \n\nOn October 16, 2014, the plaintiffs moved for to lift the stay in this case and enter judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on their motion for summary judgment in light of the final decision in Bostic. On October 29, 2014, the defendants filed motions to dismiss on the grounds that Bostic rendered the case moot, opposing the entry of any judgment in this case and arguing that the class is not a prevailing party.\n\nThough the parties had disagreements about attorneys' fees and whether the plaintiffs should be seen as a prevailing party for purposes of recovering fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. 1988, the parties decided against litigating the issues, and agreed to resolve any remaining claims and differences through a consent order submitted to Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen in Bostic. Judge Wright Allen entered the consent order on February 13, 2015. The consent order granted the Harris class the benefit of the declaratory and injunctive relief entered in Bostic, and provided for $60,000 in attorneys' fees and costs to the Harris class.\n\nOn February 18, 2015, Judge Urbanski dismissed the case with prejudice following the parties stipulation of dismissal in accordance with the Bostic consent order.

On February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, served the Governor of Arizona with a notice letter regarding their intent to investigate allegations of sexual abuse and violations of privacy rights of female inmates in the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADOC).  \n\nThe Department of Justice sent its finding to Arizona governor J. Fife Symington on August 8, 1996.  The investigation found significant evidence of physical sexual misconduct and constitutionally unacceptable invasions of privacy.  This included sexual relations between inmates and employees, sexual assaults, and frequent, prolonged viewing during dressing and showering of inmates.  \n\nIn response to these findings the DOJ offered a series of recommendations which included: better screening of employees; improved training; investigation of any allegations of sexual misconduct or unlawful invasion of privacy; stronger sanctions including criminal prosecution for employee offenses; use of an independent outside agency to investigate allegations; as well as a number of proactive steps to address sexual misconduct and unlawful invasions of privacy.  The findings letter also recommended the creation of a Women's Facilities Administrator to serve as a liaison between the women's facilities and ADOC's Director and Deputy Director.  In conclusion, the findings letter provided a warning that should the ADOC not address these problems the Attorney General could institute a lawsuit to correct the deficiencies.\n\nOn March 10, 1997, the United States filed a complaint against the State of Arizona and Gov. Symington in the District of Arizona (Judge Roslyn Silver).

The complaint sought to enjoin the Defendants from &quot;&quot;continuing the acts, practices and omissions&quot;&quot; of allowing sexual misconduct and unlawful invasion of the privacy of female inmates.  \n\nOn October 2, 1998, Defendants moved for summary judgment.  Prior to any ruling by the Court, the parties reached a settlement, which was filed on March 11, 1999.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a putative class action by five individuals held at Lompoc, a low-security prison facing one of the largest outbreaks of COVID-19 among U.S. federal prisons. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to undertake reasonable preventative measures, which allowed the virus to spread to 60% of those in custody. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief for improved conditions of confinement, as well as a writ of habeas corpus for release. On July 14, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and granted provisional class certification. On September 18, the court denied the defendant's July 2 motion to dismiss the case. On September 10, the plaintiffs had submitted a motion to enforce compliance with the preliminary injunction and an order to show cause which was granted on October 8. The case is ongoing. <hr>\n\nOn May 16, 2020, five individuals filed a putative class action against Lompoc, a low-security prison facing one of the largest outbreaks of COVID-19 among U.S federal prisons, for immediate relief on behalf of a proposed class of all current and future people in post-conviction custody at Lompoc. The plaintiffs alleged that the Warden of Lompoc and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) failed to adequately treat infected prisoners and implement reasonable health and safety measures, which resulted in 60% of the population at Lompoc testing positive. The plaintiffs also alleged that despite BOP’s broadened discretion to allow for home confinement during the pandemic, prisoners reporting symptoms were instead placed in solitary confinement in converted warehouses without medical care. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged that because Lompoc was incapable of providing adequate medical care, continued confinement amounted to a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. \n\nRepresented by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California and the Prison Law Office, the plaintiffs brought this action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, an injunctive action, and as a declaratory action under § 2201. The plaintiffs sought enlargement of custody to home confinement and for mitigation measures to be adopted in Lompoc to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including: social distancing, free soap, paper towels and cleaning supplies, access to hand sanitizer, daily showers, identification procedures for potentially infected inmates, and proper medical care for those who have COVID-19. The case was assigned to District Judge Consuelo. B Marshall and referred to Magistrate Judge Pedro V. Castillo on May 18. \n\nOn June 1, the plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction requiring Lompoc to undertake health and safety measures as well as a court-supervised process for individualized consideration of each prisoner’s suitability for release on an accelerated schedule. The plaintiffs also moved for class certification on June 4. \n\nOn July 2, the defendants moved to dismiss the case, claiming that the habeas claim failed because inmate placement decisions are not judicially reviewable and because the plaintiffs failed to exhaust other administrative remedies as required under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). They also argued that the Eighth Amendment claim should be dismissed because the defendant did not act with deliberate indifference. \n\nOn July 14, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and granted provisional class certification. 107 Fed.R.Serv.3d 477. The defendants were ordered to provide the court a list identifying all members of the class and evaluate each provisional class member’s eligibility for home confinement, giving substantial weight to the inmate’s risk factors for severe illness or death from COVID-19 based on age (over 50) or underlying health conditions, among other things.\n\nOn September 10, the plaintiffs submitted a motion to enforce compliance with the preliminary injunction and an order to show cause. The plaintiffs claimed that defendant's failure to promptly release approved class members and the denial of home confinement violated the terms of the preliminary injunction. \n\nThe court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss on September 18, finding that the plaintiffs asserted a proper habeas claim challenging the fact of their confinement, and that the habeas claim is not foreclosed by the requirements of the PLRA. The court also found that the plaintiffs plead sufficient facts to satisfy the objective prong of their Eighth Amendment claim by alleging that they are are at substantial risk of exposure to COVID-19 and to satisfy the subjective prong by alleging that the defendants have ignored, and therefore have been deliberately indifferent, to the known risks of COVID-19 based on the conditions at Lompoc. The court also disagreed with the defendants that the plaintiffs failed exhaust administrative remedies for their claims, noting that the plaintiffs' complaint alleges that “since the COVID-19 outbreak in Lompoc, those incarcerated have been denied access to the administrative remedy process,” and “[s]taff have not been accepting the forms required to initiate the process, claiming they cannot do so due to the exigency of the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nThe court-appointed inspector submitted a status report on the Lompoc facility regarding the conditions and the adequacy of the defendant's response to the pandemic. The inspector identified several deficiencies in several areas, including COVID-19 screening among detained people, lack of timely access to health care, and lack of infection control in housing areas.\n\nOn October 8, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to enforce compliance with the preliminary injunction and ordered defendants to confirm that all eligible class members were released to home confinement, and, if some class members were denied release to provide an explanation to the court.\n\nThe parties attended multiple hearings over the next several months and on January 29, the plaintiffs filed another motion to enforce compliance with the preliminary injunction. After a motion hearing, the court set a March 26 deadline for the plaintiffs to provide support for their contention that the defendants impermissibly imposed categorical bars on inmates' eligibility for home confinement. \n\nIn February, an individual attempted to intervene and file an amended complaint. On March 2, the court rejected the intervention and refused to file the letter on the grounds that individual class members could not file amended complaints in a class action suit. On March 19, 2021, the intervenor appealed the case to the Ninth Circuit. The appeal has not been assigned a USCA No. yet. \n\nOn March 19, the plaintiffs filed an ex parte application to continue to modify the case schedule and authorize a doctor site visit, which the court granted on March 22.

That action was certified as a class action on February 10, 1989 by order of Judge Peter C. Dorsey.  On May 16, 1989, the parties entered into a Consent Judgment on Inmate AIDS Education and Pre- and Post-HIV Test Counseling and it was approved by the court.  Discovery continued regarding issues not addressed in that judgment. On December 6, 1990, the court (Judge Jose A. Cabranes) approved and entered the Consent Judgment on Health Care for HIV-Infected Inmates and Confidentiality of HIV-Related Information.  In Re: Connecticut Prison Overcrowding and AIDS Cases, Nos. H-80-506, H-88-562, 1990 WL 261348 (D. Conn. Dec. 6, 1990).  The judgment required screening of all admitted inmates, individualized health care summaries for HIV-positive inmates, routine health examinations, and the use of drug therapies for HIV-positive inmates.  It also mandated the creation of a uniform statewide system for maintaining information about medical and mental health status of HIV-positive inmates.  It appears that another consent judgment, entered on November 2, 1990, called for monitoring of the facility.  The court (Judge T. Graham) closed the case on April 26, 1994 but modified the Order of Dismissal so the action could remain under the court's supervision to monitor defendant's compliance with judgment.  Litigation continued through July 1, 2004 concerning monitors' fees.               \n\nRegarding Bartkus's overcrowding case, an amended Motion for Class Certification was granted in October of 1991 and settlement discussions began in July of 1993.  On March 28, 1996, Judge Bauer entered judgment in accordance with a settlement agreement submitted by the parties.  According to the Settlement Agreement, improvements had already been made in the facility and the State of Connecticut had built additional correctional facilities, reducing overcrowded conditions.  The facility at Somers was converted from a maximum security prison into a medium security prison and its name was changed to Osborn Correctional Institute.  The agreement required that Osborn not increase its inmate population, continue operating as a medium security facility, and allow plaintiffs' lawyers access to the facility.  Litigation continued through June 15, 2000, mainly concerning monitors' fees.\n\n", "summary": "On August 22, 1980, inmates filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Connecticut Corrections Department.  This case was consolidated and named lead case with five other cases filed against the defendant in 1981 and 1982. The plaintiffs were represented by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union and Legal Assistance to Prisoners. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff's rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated because the facility was overcrowded, unsanitary, lacking in security, and unable to provide adequately the basics of general human living needs. Judgments were reached that required screening of all admitted inmates, individualized health care summaries for HIV-positive inmates, routine health examinations, and the use of drug therapies for HIV-positive inmates; as well as requiring that the prison not increase its inmate population, continue operating as a medium security facility, and allow plaintiffs' lawyers access to the facility."}
{"document": "On September 13, 2005, Prison Legal News (PLN), a non-profit legal journal devoted to reporting news and litigation concerning detention facilities, filed this action against the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. PLN sought declaratory and injunctive relief for the defendant's refusal to produce documents requested by PLN under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or grant a fee waiver for the document requests. The case was assigned to Judge Reggie B. Walton. \n\nPLN had submitted a FOIA request to the BOP on August 6, 2003, seeking documents related to litigation expenses incurred by the BOP between January 1, 1996 and July 31, 2003. In conjunction with the information request, PLN also asked the BOP to waive all associated search and duplication fees, citing the FOIA provision that required a waiver where \"disclosure of the information is in the public interest. . . and not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.\" The BOP refused to grant the fee waiver, claiming that PLN had failed to explain how the information request would be of public interest, and that the request was overbroad. PLN appealed the BOP's decision to the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Information and Privacy, which concluded that PLN's request for a fee waiver had properly been denied. Specifically, PLN did not demonstrate that the information would be communicated to the public and the release of the requested information would not enhance the public's understanding—especially considering that some of the requested documents were already publicly available. \n\nAfter the plaintiff began this action, the defendant filed for summary judgment on November 30, 2005. PLN filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on December 30, 2005. On June 26, 2006, the court concluded that the plaintiff had sufficiently established that disclosure of the requested information was in the public interest because it was likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government. The court also found that the plaintiff had demonstrated its intent and ability to disseminate the information to the relevant public. The defendant stipulated to pay $48,709.72 in attorney's fees and costs. \n\nOn February 15, 2007, the court first ordered the defendant to process the plaintiff's FOIA request by March 20, 2007. But the defendant continued to request extensions of time to comply. PLN did not oppose the extensions until September 2007, when it noted to the court that compliance was already long overdue. \n\nThe defendant eventually produced approximately 11,000 pages in response to the plaintiff’s FOIA request, but 2,993 of these pages contained redactions. The defendant stated that these redactions were allowed under specific FOIA exemptions, but the plaintiff claimed that the defendant’s justification was insufficient. PLN filed for judgment on March 28, 2008 and a court order for the defendant to properly comply with the request. The defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On March 26, 2009, the court ordered the defendant to either search for the records sought by the plaintiff or submit an affidavit indicating that the documents could be properly withheld under FOIA exemptions. \n\nOn February 25, 2011, the court granted in part and denied in part both parties' motions for summary judgment. It agreed that the defendant had adequately searched for the requested documents, but agreed with the plaintiff that the defendant had not sufficiently justified its use of FOIA exemptions to redact or withhold information. The court requested that the defendant provide additional explanations about the relative weight of competing public and private interests at stake in a sufficiently detailed manner to enable the court to assess whether the exemptions were properly asserted. The court issued a schedule for the defendant to bring itself into compliance with the requirements of <i>Vaughn v. Rosen</i>. A Vaughn index is an itemized, detailed justification of a party’s claims that documents or portions thereof are exempt from FOIA. 484 F.2d 820. \n\nIn May 2011, the defendant produced a new Vaughn index, which the plaintiff claimed did not sufficiently justify the redactions. In response, the defendant provided the plaintiff with newly redacted documents, and a second supplemental Vaughn index. The plaintiff was still unsatisfied, because the documents contained redactions of individual names, job titles, department descriptions, work addresses, dates of employment, dates of events and entire sentences of text. In a memorandum opinion issued on July 23, 2013, the court ruled in favor of the defendant: it held that the defendant had properly relied on an exemption that allows information to be redacted or withheld if there is a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy that is not outweighed by the public interest. At this time, the case was closed. \n\nThe plaintiff appealed to the DC Circuit Court on August 22, 2013 (USCA Case Number 12-5269). PLN argued that the district court erred in balancing the individual's privacy interest against the public interest in disclosure. On August 5, 2015, the Court of Appeals held that the defendant had not sufficiently justified its redactions; the court reversed and remanded the district court’s decision. The court concluded that the defendant had combined the privacy interests of all individuals whose information was redacted into categories based on the type of document within which the individual's information appeared. The court found several problems with this categorical methodology: because the categories were centered on specific types of filed documents, they included a wide range of claims covering various degrees of privacy interests. But these privacy interests could be different depending on the claim. The categorical approach failed to distinguish between redacting the identity of the alleged victim and the identity of the alleged perpetrator, and the defendant made no effort to distinguish between the privacy interests of employees who were victims and those who were perpetrators. The court also found that the defendant redacted inconsistently; the names of some alleged perpetrators were redacted while others were not. For all these reasons, the Court of Appeals remanded the case, requiring the defendant to fashion a coherent catalogue of the documents still in dispute and instructing the district court to balance privacy and public interests in light of the defendant’s new submissions. 787 F.3d 1142. \n\nOn April 3, 2017, the district court approved a settlement. The parties stipulated that the defendant had acceptably produced the documents originally requested by the plaintiff and the defendant agreed to pay $420,000 in the plaintiff's attorneys’ fees and costs. The plaintiff agreed to forever discharge, release, and withdraw any claims of access to records or portions of records previously made in the lawsuit. The case was dismissed and is now closed.

{"document": "On October 1, 2012, four detained former Delaware prisoners, represented by private counsel, filed this lawsuit against Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Corrections (DDOC) and two directors of Central Offender Records (COR). They alleged that the defendants' failure to take steps to correct the allegedly well known and long-term (since at least 2008) dysfunction of COR constituted a violation of the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that DDOC and COR maintained inadequate staff, training, discipline policies, and hours of operation, along with a host of other policies, that led to frequent overdetention, ranging from 12 hours to days, weeks, months, and possibly even years past court-ordered release. The plaintiffs filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, individually and as a class, on behalf of all those incarcerated in a DDOC facility as of October 1, 2008 or later who were not or would not be released within 12 hours of the expiration of their sentence or the forwarding of a court order for release. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent the defendants from pursing practices that caused overdetention, damages, appointment of a monitor to supervise COR, and attorneys’ fees and cost.\n\nOn December 4, 2012, an additional DDOC prisoner filed pro se to intervene in the case. He claimed that errors in the calculation of his date of imprisonment and his good time could lead to 8 years or more of overdetention. Additionally, on August 15, 2013, the prisoner filed a motion for partial summary judgment to adjust his date of imprisonment and good time credit.\n\nThe case was referred to Magistrate Judge Christopher J. Burke for mediation on January 24, 2013.\n\nWhile the intervenor's motions were still pending, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the complaint on June 2, 2014. The plaintiffs sought to add further factual support and examples of overdetained inmates.\n\nOn September 29, 2014, Judge Leonard P. Stark denied the DDOC’s prisoner’s motions to intervene and for partial summary judgment because the prisoner failed to show how his interests would not be adequately represented as a member of the class. 2014 WL 4925227. At the same time, Judge Stark granted the plaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint. \n\nOn October 3, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class and the defendants filed a motion to strike certain members of the class. The defendants then filed a motion for summary judgment a few months later in March 2015.\n\nJudge Stark denied class certification, denied the motion to strike certain members of the class as moot, and granted summary judgment to the defendants on September 30, 2015. 2015 WL 5768936. Judge Stark denied class certification to the plaintiffs because some members of the proposed class were overdetained due to delays in the court system while others were detained due to delays at COR. Judge Stark granted summary judgment to the defendants because the plaintiffs failed to produce evidence that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the overdetention problem and found no causal connection between actions or policies by the defendants and the harm suffered by the plaintiffs.\n\nSubsequently, the plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment on October 28, 2014. Judge Stark denied the motion on March 21, 2016 because the plaintiffs’ motion seemed like an attempt to rehash arguments already made at summary judgment without any new evidence. 2016 WL 1089408.\n\nOn April 19, 2016, the plaintiffs appealed the denial of class certification, granting of summary judgment to the defendants, and denial of the motion to alter or amend the judgment to the Third Circuit.

{"document": "On June 18, 2009, a group of Muslim prisoners (including John Walker Lindh, the &quot;American Taliban&quot;) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against the warden of the Federal Correctional Institute. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Indiana, asked for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the prison's allowance of only one hour of group prayer per week violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nArguments focused on Muslim tradition, which calls for five sessions of prayer of each day with group prayer being preferable over individual sessions. The plaintiffs alleged that the prison's policy of only allowing one hour of prayer per week did not serve a compelling government purpose. Furthering their belief was the living conditions of the prisoners, which allowed them to be out of their cells most of the day.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for certification of a class consisting of all Muslim prisoners aggrieved by this policy. However, the district court (Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson) denied this motion, holding that the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently define a class and, regardless, could not satisfy the numerosity requirement necessary to have class certification approved. The plaintiffs could only identify five Muslim prisoners under the warden's control whose beliefs on prayer coincided with their own.\n\nBoth parties filed motion for summary judgment, and Judge Magnus-Stinson granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion, while denying the defendant's motion (2012 WL 379737). She held, as a matter of law, that &quot;recitation of the five daily Muslim group prayers is a religious exercise rooted in Mr. Lindh's sincerely held religious beliefs,&quot; thus satisfying that requirement of RFRA. However, she deemed that there were genuine issues of material fact surrounding the issue of whether the warden substantially burdened the plaintiffs' religious practices. \n\nFollowing a bench trial, the court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law (2013 WL 139699). The court issued a permanent injunction against the Federal Correctional Institute, holding that the prison's policy violated RFRA. As such, the prison was required to change its policy regarding prayer sessions without 60 days of the issuing of the order. Under the order, the prison was required to allow prisoners to have prayer sessions at any time that the prisoners would otherwise be allowed out of their cells.\n\nThe prison changed its policy to allow religious groups to pray at three assigned times per day, with no more than 10 inmates allowed in the room at any time. Feeling that the policy violated the order of the court, the plaintiffs filed a motion to hold the defendant in contempt. After the filing of the motion, the prison again changed its policy to only allow for group prayer within individual cells, with a maximum of two prisoners allowed in any cell. The plaintiffs alleged that the warden violated the express and unambiguous command of the court, and therefore must be held in contempt.\n\nThe court held that its prior ruling was not clear and unambiguous, and therefore did not hold the defendant in contempt (2013 WL 3790897). However, Judge Magnus-Stinson did further clarify her past order, declaring that &quot;the Warden is to allow group prayer during every Muslim prayer time for which the inmates are not confined to their cells. While the Warden may place a limit on the location and number of inmates who may assemble in a single place, the limitations must be reasonable and in keeping with RFRA's requirement that they are the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling interest be employed.

The DLC is the agency designated by the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act, 42 U.S.C. §§10801 et seq. to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to ensure that individuals with mental illnesses confined in Massachusetts prisons are protected from abuse and neglect.  \n\nDLC claimed that the DOC failed to take into account mental illness when subjecting prisoners to long periods of disciplinary and other forms of isolation and segregation. The plaintiff asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that isolation of mentally ill prisoners constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that DOC's failure to address the problem violates both the Rehabilitation Act and the American with Disabilities Act.\n\nThe parties began settlement negotiations in November 2007 and in 2008 sought mediation from the court. For two years the parties were unsuccessful in their negotiations, and on August 12, 2010, the court lifted a stay on discovery. 2010 WL 3199883.

In December 2011, the parties reached a settlement and sought court approval. \n\nOn April 12, 2012, after a lengthy exploration of judicial authority to approve private settlements in which the defendant did not admit liability, Chief Judge Mark L. Wolf approved the settlement, holding that doing so would not violate the PLRA's provision that relief be limited to what is necessary to remedy the violation. The settlement agreement established detailed procedures, training, time limits, and recordkeeping to ensure that mentally ill prisoners are not placed in isolation or segregation without a full evaluation and determination that such placement will not cause further injury.

{"document": "On November 24, 2015, several inmates with hearing disabilities filed this class action in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs sued the Massachusetts Department of Correction and the Massachusetts Partnership for Correctional Healthcare under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). Represented by a combination of Prisoners' Legal Services, Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights & Urban Affairs, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated persons. They claimed that the Massachusetts Department of Correction failed to provide interpreters, appropriate assistive technology, and accommodations to deaf and hard of hearing prisoners over the course of nearly a decade. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants denied them reasonable accommodation under the ADA. They alleged that they were denied technology such as teletypewriters and videophones that would make communicating with family possible. One named plaintiff alleged that because of the denial of assistive technology, she had not spoken to her family in several years. The plaintiffs also alleged that the lack of interpreters and accessible materials prevented them from engaging in programs that would allow them to earn good time. The denial of accommodations meant that the plaintiffs did not have meaningful access to healthcare, allegedly waiting nearly two years for hearing aid replacements and not being able to communicate with doctors.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a class certification. The court denied the motion without prejudice on June 29, 2016 as premature. The defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss Counts I and II of the complaint on January 26, 2017. The court assigned the case to Magistrate Judith G. Dein for discovery. After over a year of discovery and its related disputes, as well as multiple status conferences before the Magistrate, the parties began the negotiation process. The judge granted a stay in proceedings until parties completed Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mediation. On March 30, 2018, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that it could not dismiss the plaintiffs' claims without a more developed factual record. On June 27, 2018, the plaintiffs stipulated dismissal as to the Massachusetts Partnership for Correctional Healthcare. \n\nThe plaintiffs continued to engage with the defendants in mediation proceedings until May 28, 2019 when the parties filed for preliminary approval of a class settlement. The proposed settlement established intake procedures to identify and provide the appropriate reasonable accommodations for people with hearing disabilities. The settlement emphasized that the individual's request as to what accommodation would suit him or her should weigh heavily in the Department's decision on the accommodation it would provide. It also agreed to provide qualified sign language interpreters so that individuals would enjoy meaningful access to the programs inside the prisons. The settlement's provisions on telecommunication provided that each facility would provide access to at least one of each type of technological service—Video Relay Services (VRI), captioned telephones, teletypewriters (TTY)—as well as sound amplification devices. Moreover, individuals would not be charged for use of their accommodations and would also be given extra time, considering the delays in communication that are inherent in these services. In addition to alternative means of notification, like vibrating watches and other tactile services, the settlement provided for training for prison administrators to be able to communicate more effectively with individuals with hearing disabilities. \n\nThe parties agreed to third-party monitoring during the enforcement period of the settlement, with three visits per year, and auditing. However, the monitor would only provide his or her reports to the parties. Final approval of the settlement would not enter a consent decree in the case. Instead, the plaintiffs would have to provide notice to the defendant DOC if they believed the prisons were in substantial non-compliance with the agreement, and meet and confer out-of-court if the plaintiffs are not satisfied with the defendant's justification. The court remained a last resort under the agreement to invoke its \"equitable\" authority to provide or deny relief to the plaintiffs. The parties agreed to negotiate reasonable plaintiffs attorneys' fees and the settlement will remain in effect for three years from the time of the court's final approval.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a habeas action brought by a group of inmates in the the Maine Department of Corrections, seeking release of inmates due to COVID-19. The plaintiffs' claims were dismissed and the case is now closed. <hr>\n\nA group of vulnerable prisoners brought this lawsuit against the Maine Department of Corrections, alleging that the Department was not sufficiently protecting them against the threat of serious illness or death from the virus.  Represented by the ACLU of Maine, they filed this petition for habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine on May 15, 2020.  The petition was assigned to Judge John A. Woodcock, Jr.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the Department was refusing to use medical furlough to reduce the risk of infection for inmates.  One caseworker had told an inmate that “there’s nobody being released because of medical conditions, so you can get that idea right out of your head.”  In fact, instead of releasing prisoners in an effort to de-densify, as correctional institutions across the country had done, the Department had added “many new technical requirements” for medical furlough.  The plaintiffs additionally alleged that the precautions the Department was taking to protect against outbreaks in its facilities were insufficient to protect prisoners, especially medically vulnerable prisoners, from contracting the virus.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought to represent a class of “all current and future inmates who, by reason of age or medical condition, [were] particularly vulnerable to injury or death if they were to contract COVID-19.”  They proposed 3 subclasses:<ul><li>an Imminent Release Subclass, composed of inmates scheduled to be released within one year;<li>a Minimum Security Subclass, composed of inmates who posed a low security risk and who were housed in minimum-security or community-security settings; and<li>a Disabilities Subclass, composed of people who were medically vulnerable due to underlying medical conditions that qualified as disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.</ul> They argued that the policy of keeping vulnerable prisoners in prison, when they could otherwise qualify for medical furlough or home confinement, was a violation of the Eight Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment; that the policy was a violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act for members of the Disabilities Subclass; and that because the policy was unconstitutional and unlawful, the members of the class and subclasses qualified for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. §2241. \n\nThey sought a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, an order of enlargement (an order requiring the Department to release prisoners on bail during the pendency of the habeas proceedings), and/or a writ of habeas corpus.  They also sought a declaration that it was unconstitutional and unlawful for the Department to categorically deny medical furlough during the pandemic.  They requested an order requiring the Department to identify all members of the class and subclasses within two days, to evaluate each class member’s eligibility for medical furlough, home confinement, or other accommodation, and to release enough prisoners “to ensure that all remaining persons are incarcerated...consistent with CDC guidance.”\n\nOn May 18, 2020, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.  The following day, the Department reported its first COVID diagnosis.  On June 8, 2020, the court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order. The court held, among other things, that \"[g]iven the relatively low number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in MDOC facilities and what the Court expects will be a rapid resolution of the request for a preliminary injunction, the Court does not see the need for temporary injunctive relief at this time.\" 2020 WL 3052220.\n\nThe Department moved to dismiss the lawsuit on June 22, 2020.  The plaintiffs later moved to convert their claim, originally brought under 28 U.S.C. §2241, to an action under §2254. The Court granted this motion on July 15. 2020 WL 4004795.\n\nOn August 14, Judge Woodcock dismissed the plaintiffs' habeas claims without prejudice, and dismissed the motion for preliminary injunction as moot. 2020 WL 4736462. Judge Woodcock found that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their state remedies as they were statutorily required to do before seeking habeas relief.

{"document": "On October 30, 2007, a state prison inmate filed a §1983 lawsuit against the Chief Medical Officer of the Michigan Department of Corrections' Bureau of Health Care Services and three unnamed individual members of the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC).  The plaintiff, who originally filed pro se but was later represented by the University of Michigan Law School General Clinic, sought declarative, monetary, and injunctive relief, claiming that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's serious medical needs when they repeatedly denied his request for cataract surgery.  Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that after he received cataract surgery in his right eye in August 2004, defendants repeatedly denied his request for the same surgery in his left eye for several years, until he was finally given the surgery on April 14, 2008.  \n\nPlaintiff was incarcerated in a Michigan state prison at the time of the complaint and throughout the litigation.  The state of Michigan contracts with Correctional Medical Services (CMS) which provides primary-care services to state inmates.  If an inmate's primary care physician writes a referral to a specialist, CMS is responsible for comparing the referral to the MDOC criteria for provision of off-site specialty care.  If CMS denies the referral, the primary care provider can appeal the decision by arguing that the referral was warranted in his/her best medical judgment.  The appeal would not reach an MDOC officer until after a second appeal by the primary care physician.  The MDOC officer would submit that appeal to the chief medical officer, who would then take it to the MSAC for a decision.    \n\nOn August 30, 2004, plaintiff received surgery on his right eye.  The physician who performed the surgery requested that plaintiff be returned in six weeks for surgery on the left eye.  Plaintiff claimed that over the next four years, 16 separate requests for the surgery were denied and that each optometrist, doctor and ophthalmologist who examined the plaintiff said that he needed the surgery.  (Appellate Brief, 2)  Plaintiff finally received the surgery on his left eye on April 14, 2008.  \n\nOn June 10, 2008, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint dropping state agency defendants with Eleventh Amendment immunity and adding individual MSAC members.  He also added CMS as well as two physicians who served as CMS's Michigan medical directors.  \n\nAt two points, in 2008 and 2009, various defendants filed motions for summary judgment based on the doctrine of qualified immunity.  Both times, the magistrate judge [Charles Binder] filed a Report and Recommendation recommending that those motions be denied.  Both times, the district court [Judge Anna Diggs Taylor] adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation and denied the motions.  \n\nThe defendant Chief Medical Officer of MDOC filed an interlocutory appeal, on August 25, 2010, of the district court's denial of his motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.  On April 10, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit [Circuit Judge Deborah L. Cook] issued an opinion reversing the district court.  The court applied a two-step test to qualified immunity claims in deliberate-indifference cases, determining 1) whether, based upon the applicable law, a constitutional violation has occurred; and 2) whether that violation involved a clearly established constitutional right.  The court also asked whether plaintiff could prove two elements to prevail on his claim: first, that he suffered from a \"sufficiently serious\" medical need, and second, that the defendant acted with a \"sufficiently culpable state of mind.\"  The court found that the plaintiff proved the first element but not the second.  The court found that defendant may not have been aware of the seriousness of plaintiff's condition based on the medical reports, and that the provision of care that plaintiff did receive was based on defendant's medical judgment, not on deliberate indifference.  \n\nOn May 30, 2012, the district court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant Chief Medical Officer of MDOC.

The plaintiff sued the Missouri Department of Corrections (MDOC) and Corizon LLC, the contracted medical provider for MDOC, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by Lambda Legal, she sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming violations of the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. Judge Noelle Collins was assigned to this case. \n\nThe plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to provide medical care despite the plaintiff’s serious medical needs. The plaintiff was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and deemed by her doctors to be in need of medical services. The defendants were aware of the plaintiff’s condition but denied medical care. The defendants, in defense, cited a policy called “freeze-frame.” This policy denied gender dysphoria treatment unless the individual had received gender dysphoria medical care prior to being incarcerated in MDOC. \n\nOn April 4, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction asking for medical care necessary for gender dysphoria. This motion sought hormone therapy, access to permanent body hair removal, and access to gender affirming canteen items. In addition, the plaintiff asked that the court declare that the defendants’ freeze-frame policy to be unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nOn February 9, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff’s preliminary injunction request. The court granted the plaintiff’s request that she receive the medical care needed for gender dysphoria such as hormone therapy, access to permanent body hair removal, and access to gender affirming canteen items. The court, however, denied the plaintiff’s request that the defendants’ policy should be declared unconstitutional. The court’s rationale was that there should not be a blanket rule in cases involving medical care and individuals incarcerated within a prison system. These decisions, according to the court, should be individualized. For that same reason, declaratory relief was denied. 2018 WL 806764.\n\nThe plaintiff continued to challenge the defendants’ policy. On February 26, 2018, the plaintiff amended her complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. This amendment clarified that the plaintiff was not only challenging the application of the policy but also the constitutionality of the policy on its face. \n\nOn March 30, 2018, the plaintiff updated her request for declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction. And then, on May 22, 2018, the court granted the plaintiff’s request for declaratory relief and a permanent injunction. The court declared that the defendants’ failure to provide the necessary medical care was a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Moreover, the freeze-frame policy violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to account for individual medical needs of transgender prisoners who suffer from gender dysphoria, and the defendants were prohibited from implementing the freeze frame policy. The defendants were ordered to provide treatment medically necessary for the plaintiff’s gender dysphoria, including hormone therapy, permanent hair removal, and access to gender-affirming canteen items as long as she remained in custody. The defendants did not oppose the plaintiff’s motions and, prior to the order, the plaintiff agreed to dismiss the individual Corizon defendants.\n\nFurthermore, the defendants were ordered to pay for the plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The parties were ordered to reach an agreement on a reasonable amount for the attorney’s fees and costs.

The lawsuit alleged dangerous and inhumane conditions of confinement in Unit 32, a \"supermax\" facility operated by the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC). The plaintiffs immediately moved for class certification.\n\nThe MDOC was already operating under an injunction issued in Russell v. Johnson, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=799\">PC-MS-0003</a> in this Clearinghouse, which concerned conditions of confinement and medical and mental health treatment for the subclass of death row prisoners confined to Unit 32. Magistrate Judge Jerry A. Davis, who oversaw the Russell case, urged the parties to discuss settlement. Following protracted negotiations, the parties reached a settlement of the issues in the form of a proposed consent decree. After a fairness hearing on April 28, 2006, Judge Davis formally approved the settlement.\n\nThe consent decree called for the MDOC to make many changes to the conditions of confinement for non-death row inmates of Unit 32, including compliance with the ACA Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions (4th Ed.) and with the essential National Commission on Correctional Healthcare (NCCHC) Standards for Health Services in Prison (2003).\n\nFollowing the entry of the consent decree, the plaintiffs began monitoring the implementation process. Experts employed by the plaintiffs, Dr. John Robertson (medical expert) and Dr. Terry Kupers (mental health expert), conducted an audit of the medical and mental health services in Unit 32. The experts identified continuing deficiencies which they believed warranted urgent correction. The plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt on November 21, 2006, seeking an order to compel defendants to immediately comply with the medical and mental health care provisions of the consent decree.\n\nOn April 4, 2007, Judge Davis called the case for an evidentiary hearing on the plaintiffs' motion to compel. Before the hearing began, the State agreed to entry of a supplemental consent decree on medical care.  The hearing went forward on the plaintiffs' contentions that mentally ill prisoners were still being denied basic psychiatric care and routinely subjected to excessive force and abuse. The hearing was adjourned and the parties were directed to discuss settlement of the remaining issues.\n\nThe case was reset for a settlement conference and continuation of the contempt hearing on November 15, 2007. Following that conference, the parties arrived at a supplemental consent decree on mental health care, use of force, and classification, which supplemented the original consent decree entered April 28, 2006 and the supplemental consent decree on medical care entered April 16, 2007. On November 15, 2007, the parties entered into another supplemental consent decree on mental health care, use of force, and classification.\n\nOn September 16, 2008, Judge Davis denied the plaintiffs' motions for discovery and attorneys' fees as moot. \n\n On August 2, 2010, Judge Davis ordered the case dismissed without prejudice by agreement of the parties.

The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the ACLU National Prison Project and the Southern Poverty Law Center, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary relief, claiming that conditions in the EMCF violated their Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the living conditions at EMCF, designed to house and treat Mississippi's most seriously mentally ill prisoners, were so inhumane as to cause harm to the inmates through known problems with healthcare, mental healthcare, isolation, excessive force, protection from harm, nutrition, and food safety. \n\nIn September 2014, the plaintiffs moved for class certification.

Represented by the American Humanist Association's own legal team as well as private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' disparate treatment of Humanists violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, a permanent injunction, and attorneys' fees.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, both the plaintiffs and defendants filed for summary judgment. On March 29, 2018, Judge Terrence W. Boyle granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment. 303 F.Supp.3d 421. The court rejected the defendants' argument that the American Humanist Association did not have standing in this case. Judge Boyle found that the American Humanist Association had associational standing because of its representation of other Humanist inmates incarcerated by the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. \n\nRegarding the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim, the court found that the defendants violated the Establishment Clause because the defendants did not have a secular purpose for denying Humanism recognition as a religious group or for their decision to prohibit Humanist inmates from organized group meetings. In addition, the defendants failed to put forth any evidence to support space, resource, or security concerns applicable to Humanist inmates that did not apply equally to other religious groups. Regarding the plaintiffs' Equal Protection claim, the court found that a violation because the defendants' authorized other non-theistic religions but not Humanism and there was not a rational connection between the defendants' cited interests in space, resources, and security and their refusal to recognize Humanism.\n\nJudge Boyle granted the plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction, ordering DPS to recognize Humanism as a faith group and to permit a Humanist study group to meet within North Carolina state prisons on the same terms as other faiths are allowed. He also granted the plaintiffs' request for a declaratory judgment, stating that the defendants violated the Establishment Clause and the Equal Protection Clause by refusing to recognize Humanism as a faith group and to allow it to be designated on an inmate's prison records. Because the plaintiffs suffered constitutional violations at the hands of defendants, the court awarded nominal damages ($1.00) to the plaintiffs. Judge Boyle also awarded the plaintiffs attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The court retained jurisdiction to make any further orders necessary to carry out the terms of the relief.\n\nOn July 9, 2018, the court ordered defendants to pay $5,905.25 to the plaintiffs for various court costs. On July 10, 2018, the plaintiffs withdrew their motion for attorneys' fees and litigation expenses, because the parties privately settled the matter of attorneys fees and expenses.

{"document": "On October 16, 2002, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, private counsel representing a group of New Jersey state prisoners filed a lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against contract medical care providers, their executives, and New Jersey corrections officials.  In that complaint and a later, amended version, the prisoners alleged that they and their class had been exposed in the state's prisons to the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), or had been admitted to the prisons but not treated for the virus, or had contracted the virus in the prisons.  They attributed these conditions to the deliberate indifference of the defendants, which allegedly violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments' protections against cruel and unusual punishment.  The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants' conduct constituted negligence, medical malpractice, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress under state common law, and that the conduct also violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq.  The plaintiffs sought monetary and injunctive relief.  The class plaintiffs sought to represent included all past or present New Jersey state prisoners from between January 1990, and the date of filing the amended complaint, whether or not they had contracted HCV.\n\nBy the time the court adjudicated the class action issue, in May 2008, the New Jersey Department of Corrections had adopted major changes in how people with HCV were treated.  According to papers filed with the court, its new program lined up with the federal Bureau of Prisons approach.  In  particular, the court (Judge Noel Hillman) found:\n\na. The health care provider for the department, CMS, subcontracted with the Cooper Health System and its Infectious Disease Department to provide infectious disease consultations to inmates.  Cooper Hospital is also in the process of reviewing every HCV inmate's medical care to assure compliance with the FBOP's HCV Guidelines.\nb. All inmates who meet the treatment criteria in the FBOP's HCV Guidelines are offered HCV pharmacologic treatment which they can accept or reject. \nInmates who accept HCV medications are given a combination of pegylated\ninterferon in combination with ribavirin.  This pharmacologic treatment\nis FDA approved and recommended for use in the FBOP's HCV guidelines.\nc. Inmates in New Jersey, including in excess of 7,000 admitted prior to February 1, 2003, have been given a Blood Borne Pathogen Risk Assessment.  Inmates identified with a positive risk factor for HCV have been encouraged to consent to a HCV test. \nd. Any inmate who requests an HCV test is given the test.\ne. All inmates are given extensive counseling and education materials, a NJDOC video on HCV and direct communications with their healthcare providers.\nf. The inmates' Electronic Medical Records have been updated with comprehensive HCV forms to assure more consistent and thorough HCV documentation.  \ng. The care and treatment of all HCV inmates is closely tracked. \nh. CMS compiles and analyzes statistical data regarding New Jersey's HCV program to measure and analyze the effectiveness of the program.  The data is shared with the NJDOC.\ni. The NJDOC monitors the HCV care and treatment given to inmates and CMS is subject to contractual penalties if it does not comply with its contract.  \n\nGiven that the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs was this same set of reforms, Judge Hillman denied the request for injunctive relief as moot.  In addition, the court found that only prisoners who already had HCV were appropriate plaintiffs in the case--and that there was no evidence that this subset of the putative plaintiffs class was sufficiently numerous to justify class action status.  It therefore denied class certification.  As to two individual class members who had HCV, the court held there was sufficient evidence in the record to go to trial on their constitutional claims (though not on their Americans with Disabilities Act claims), and denied the state's motion for summary judgment.\n\nIn October 2009, the case settled for money damages.  It seems from some papers filed by one of the plaintiffs that he may never actually have received  his money, but when he sought the assistance of the court in enforcing the settlement against his lawyer, Judge Hillman ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction, and directed him to file a collection action in state court.

The parties filed a joint case management plan on January 20, 2017. Plaintiff moved to certify the class on January 27, 2017. On June 26, 2017, Magistrate Judge Martin C. Carlson recommended that the court provisionally certify the class. The court denied the motion to certify the class without prejudice on October 17, 2017 because the plaintiff had not introduced any evidence to support the motion for class certification and therefore, the plaintiff had not affirmatively shown compliance with Rule 23's requirements of sufficiently numerous parties and common questions of law or fact. The plaintiff was granted leave to refile the motion for class certification within a reasonable time after discovery was complete. The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Susan Schwab on June 6, 2018 for discovery disputes. \n\nOn April 12, 2019, in the midst of ongoing discovery, the court ordered the resolution of the final discovery dispute. The court ordered the plaintiff to disclose the names of prisoners who may have information relevant to the claims in this case listed on his privilege log. \n\nOn July 10, 2019, the court ordered the plaintiff's motion and its supporting brief for class certification was due by September 30, 2019. The defendant's opposition to the class certification was due by November 18, 2019, and the plaintiff's reply was due by December 9, 2019. \n\nAs of October 31, 2019, the case was ongoing.", "summary": "On July 27, 2012, plaintiff, a male prisoner, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Pennsylvania under Bivens against the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants violated plaintiff's right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution by forcing him to share a cell with a hostile prisoner, which caused a threat of violence, and by placing him in painful restraints that caused injury for prolonged periods on multiple occasions for refusing dangerous cell assignments with hostile prisoners; and that defendants violated his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution by depriving him of any meaningful process prior to and during their use of punitive measures against him. On April 9, 2013, the U.S. District Court (Judge William B. Nealon) granted in part and denied in part defendant's motion to dismiss, declining to certify the class.

{"document": "On May 18, 2015, a prisoner at the Mahanoy State Correctional Institute filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The complaint arose out of the plaintiff’s hospitalization for Hepatitis C. The plaintiff sued the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC) and the Bureau of Health Care Services of the DOC. The initial complaint claimed violations of First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiff claimed that, while hospitalized, the plaintiff’s attorneys were barred from visiting him and all communication between plaintiff and his attorney was prohibited. Represented by a local public interest firm called the Abolitionist Law Center, the plaintiff requested monetary damages and motioned for an immediate preliminary injunction ordering the defendants to allow the attorneys access to the plaintiff. District Judge Robert D. Mariani was assigned to the case.\n \nThe plaintiff is a high-profile Black Panther activist from Philadelphia. In 1982, he was convicted of murdering a Philadelphia police officer in a high-profile case. However, the plaintiff did not allege specific discrimination here.\n\nOn May 26, 2015, the plaintiff withdrew his motion for preliminary injunction, notifying the court that the defendants allowed the attorneys access to the plaintiff. On November 24, plaintiff filed a supplemental and amended complaint that added the medical facility as defendants and alleged new claims. That complaint was filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and alleged that defendants violated the plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment rights. The complaint also alleged that the DOC was negligently liable for medical malpractice. Specifically, the complaint alleged that plaintiff was denied treatment after he was diagnosed with Hepatitis C and a severe skin condition. The plaintiff alleged that during his hospitalization, he was denied available antiviral drugs.\n \nOn August 24, 2015, plaintiff filed another motion for a preliminary injunction. He requested that the court order the defendants to immediately administer the antiviral drugs and grant the plaintiff a right to in-person consultation with a doctor of his choice. The motion also requested that the court grant a permanent injunction permitting the plaintiff attorney-client and family visits once he received inpatient medical treatment. On September 18, 2015 Magistrate Judge Karoline Mehalchick recommended that plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction be denied for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and because the plaintiff had failed to show irreparable injury. 2015 WL 12116641. Essentially, the judge found that although Hepatitis C is a serious medical need, given the number of inmates who file and want the court to intervene in their treatment, the plaintiff's condition had not progressed to the point where any court intervention was warranted. \n \nOn December 7, 2015, the DOC medical staff (medical defendants) filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim, and on January 4, 2016, the DOC also filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. \n\nBoth parties began briefing both the motions to dismiss and the preliminary injunction. After several requests for extensions, Judge Mariani ordered both parties to submit briefs on the motions by March 11, 2016. On April 4, 2016, defendants filed a motion to strike a portion of the complaint on the grounds that it was immaterial. Judge Mariani denied that motion on June 3, 2016, finding that nothing was irrelevant or immaterial in the cited paragraphs of the amended complaint. \n\nOn June 21, 2016, DOC defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. At the same time, the court denied the medical defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants had argued that the plaintiff failed to exhaust all his administrative remedies through the prison before filing the suit, specifically claiming that he had not filed a grievance specific to his Hepatitis C treatment. Judge Mariani disagreed, finding that the plaintiff had filed the appropriate grievances through the prison. \n\nOn August 5, 2016, the court granted in part and denied in part the DOC defendants’ motion to dismiss. Judge Mariani dismissed plaintiff’s request for monetary damage from the prison superintendent on the grounds that plaintiff could not recover against him in his official capacity. The state negligence claims were also dismissed -- defendant was entitled to sovereign immunity because he was not a health care employee under Pennsylvania State Law. That same day, he granted the medical facility’s motion to dismiss. \n\nThe plaintiff was granted time to file an amended complaint, which he filed on August 16, 2016. The following week, Judge Mariani denied the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. In his opinion he concluded the plaintiff had been denied proper medical treatment, but that the named defendants were not the appropriate defendants. The named defendants were not members of the Hepatitis C Treatment Review Committee and therefore the court could not properly issue an injunction against them.  Though reaching the same result, Judge Mariani refused to adopt Magistrate Judge Karoline Mehalchick's report and recommendations from 2015 because Judge Mariani found that the court had significant new evidence from the evidentiary hearing that raised new issues. \n\nOn January 10, 2017, Judge Mariani dismissed the defendants’ summary judgment motion as moot, and on January 17, 2017 the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint. On May 4, 2017, Judge Mariani granted a motion to consolidate this case with another, <i> Abu-Jamal v. Wetzel </i> because of the common questions concerning Pennsylvania medical care.\n\nOn June 26, 2017, Judge Mariani referred the case to the Court’s Prison Litigation Settlement Committee to facilitate discussions. On August 23, 2017, the plaintiff filed his fourth amended complaint, which the defendants moved to dismiss. The court-appointed mediator reported on October 27, 2017 that a settlement had not yet been reached. \n\nOn May 10, 2018, Judge Mariani denied the medical defendants’ motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the medical defendants were personally involved in the failure to treat his Hepatitis C and that he received only superficial treatment by the medical defendants. Judge Mariani next reviewed the DOC defendants’ motion to dismiss: he granted the DOC defendants’ motion to dismiss the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections as a defendant because the plaintiff did not oppose that dismissal, but denied the DOC defendants’ motion in all other respects. On June 11, 2018, the DOC defendants appealed the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and dismissed appeal in part on July 19, 2019 (779 Fed.Appx. 893). \n\nOn January 30, 2020, both the DOC defendants and the medical defendants filed for summary judgment and are awaiting the court's response as of September 15, 2020.

{"document": "On June 9, 2017, three mentally ill prisoners of the U.S. Penitentiary at Lewisburg (USP Lewisburg) filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The case was assigned to Judge Yvette Kane. The plaintiffs sued the Federal Bureau of Prisons, alleging that the defendants’ failure to provide adequate treatment for prisoners with mental illness constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiffs alleged that they were deprived of medication, received puzzles and coloring pages in lieu of treatment, and had five-minute conversations in the public showers with mental health professionals instead of formal therapy sessions. Represented by the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, Washington Lawyers’ Committee, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nOn August 11, 2017, the plaintiffs moved for class certification. The class would consist of all persons who were, as of the filing date of the complaint in this case, or are now, or will be in the future, confined to the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons in the United States Penitentiary Lewisburg and suffer from a Serious Mental Illness or a Mental Illness, requiring treatment under one or more of the BOP’s CARE levels.\n\nOn October 2, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgement. In the two weeks after filing the motion, the defendants filed a motion to stay the plaintiff’s motion for class certification pending their motion to dismiss and a statement of material facts containing records of the plaintiff’s interactions with mental health services. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs’ complaint did not sufficiently demonstrate that the defendants failed to provide treatment; rather, it merely demonstrated that the plaintiffs disagreed with the treatments that the medical professionals prescribed for them. On December 7, 2017, the court granted the defendants’ motion to stay class certification until after the defendants’ motion to dismiss was decided.\n\nOn June 20, 2018, Magistrate Judge Schwab issued a report recommending that the defendants’ motion to dismiss be denied. She found that the plaintiffs had not actually raised separate Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement claim in their complaint, but invited the plaintiffs to do so in an amended complaint if so desired. With regard to the Eighth Amendment medical care claims, the Magistrate Judge found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged facts to state a claim of deliberate indifference, and so denied the motion to dismiss on that basis as well. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs' complaint violated the favorable termination rule (by challenging the duration of their confinement), but the Magistrate Judge recommended that the court temporarily deny the motion to dismiss on that objection. The plaintiffs objected to the recommendation saying that they did not challenge the duration of their confinement, nor did they raise Eighth Amendment conditions claims. \n\nOn October 26, 2018 Judge Yvette Kane adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation insofar as it denied the defendants motion to dismiss, motion for summary judgment, and motion to stay discovery. The case was then reassigned to Magistrate Judge Schwab. \n\nOver the following months, Magistrate Judge Schwab issued several orders. The first, on November 27, 2018, granted the plaintiffs motion for a protective order. The second, on February 22, 2019, denied class certification without prejudice. Discovery continued in the wake of these orders. \n\nOn November 20, 2019, Chief Judge Christopher C. Conner issued a verbal order reassigning the case from Judge Yvette Kane to Judge Jennifer P. Wilson, and the plaintiffs again moved for class certification. On January 29, 2020, Magistrate Judge Schwab issued an order requiring that plaintiffs show cause why their claims should not be denied as moot and also issued a recommendation that the plaintiff's motion for class certification be denied due to lack of numerosity, among other grounds. \n\nOn February 24, 2021, Judge Wilson declined to adopt Magistrate Judge Schwab's recommendation to deny the class certification due to lack of numerosity and recommitted the matter to Magistrate Judge Schwab with instructions to make further findings on whether the plaintiff's claims had been rendered moot by the closure of the Special Management Unit at USP Lewisburg. \n\nOn March 23, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal after conferring with Defendant's counsel. Both parties agreed that the subject of the plaintiff's legal action had been mooted by the closure of SMU at USP Lewisburg and the transfer of the named plaintiffs to other prisons within the BOP.

Plaintiffs alleged that as a result of Hurricane Rita they were subject to inhumane and unsanitary conditions of confinement. Plaintiffs also alleged that the conditions under which they were employed at a UNICOR factory manufacturing Kevlar helmets for a Department of Defense contract were similarly inhumane. Plaintiffs alleged that as a result of a delay in production caused by Hurricane Rita they were forced to work grueling days in unsanitary conditions, while also being subject to confinement at the Beaumont Federal Correctional Institution which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Rita and not fit to house prisoners. \n\nIn February 2009, the U.S. moved to dismiss the case, and in the alternative for summary judgment. Briefing was voluminous, but appears to have ended in October 2009.  As of March 2012, the judge had not decided the motion -- and issued a notice stating his intention to decide it soon.  This did not happen, however.  While the motion was pending, in October 2012, the plaintiffs' lawyer died.  No other lawyer appeared to take his place.  A year later, in December 2013, Magistrate Judge Giblin recommended that the case be dismissed for failure to prosecute.

{"document": "On October 17, 2005, a Sunni Muslim incarcerated at Keen Mountain Correctional Center in Virginia filed this lawsuit, pro se, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. The plaintiff sued officers at the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) and the Keen Mountain Correctional Center under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). The plaintiff alleged violations of his rights under the First Amendment. Specifically, he alleged that during his Ramadan fast the defendants deprived him of adequate nutrition and calories in 2002 – 2004, when instead of providing a full 2,200 calories including two hot meals, the defendants only provided 1,000 calories of cold-bag meals. As a result, the plaintiff said he lost 13 pounds and had a diminished religious experience because he was constantly hungry. Additionally, the plaintiff alleged the defendants refused to permit him and other Muslims to conduct the Eid prayer service and Eid-al-Fitr feast to celebrate the completion of Ramadan. Lastly, the plaintiff alleged the loss of nutrition and calories violated his right to Equal Protection and Due Process in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiff sought punitive damages of $545, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief requiring the defendants to revise the Ramadan menu to ensure all Ramadan fast participants received adequate nutrition and calories, the option for two hot meals, and the opportunity to participate in the Eid-al-Fitr Observance. \n\nThe parties consented to proceedings before a Magistrate Judge and the case was assigned to Judge Pamela Meade Sargent. \n\nOn January 12, 2006, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment arguing the plaintiff’s claims should be dismissed because the plaintiff voluntarily fasted and was permitted to partake in the Eid-al-Fitr prayer service and feast at a different time than alleged in the complaint.\n\nOn February 9, 2006, the plaintiff filed a motion to supplement his pleadings with similar allegations against the defendants for Ramadan 2005, which occurred in October and November 2005. Judge Sargant granted the motion on February 22, 2006.\n\nAs the 2006 Ramadan fast approached, the defendants indicated there would be no changes to their Ramadan procedures. In response, on August 30, 2006, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction ordering the defendants to provide an amount of food equivalent to that provided to non-fasting prisoners. On the same day, the plaintiff filed a motion to appoint counsel, but Judge Sargent denied the request for counsel on September 8, 2006.\n\nOn September 22, 2006, the court issued two orders on the outstanding motions for summary judgement and for preliminary injunctive relief. In ruling on the motion for summary judgment, the court granted it in part and denied it in part. 479 F.Supp.2d 569. In a 53 page opinion, the court found that the 2002 claims were barred by the statute of limitations and that the plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act for some of the 2003, 2004, and 2005 claims. The court denied summary judgment to the defendants on the following claims, and ordered they be set for trial:\n-First Amendment and RLUIPA claims that he was denied adequate nutrition and calories during Ramadan 2004 and the associated Due Process claim regarding this allegation;\n-First Amendment and RLUIPA claims that he was denied the Eid-al-Fitr meal following Ramadan 2003 and 2005; and\n- First Amendment and RLUIPA claims that he was deprived of the Eid-al-Fitr prayer service following Ramadan 2004.\n\nIn ruling on the motion for a preliminary injunction, the court granted the plaintiff's request and ordered the defendants to provide daily food containing approximately 2,200 calories, between sunset and dawn during the 2006 Ramadan period, beginning the next day. The court granted the preliminary injunction because the defendants did not present evidence to contradict the plaintiff’s claim that he suffered weight loss due to the reduced caloric intake during Ramadan and the same weight loss would likely happen during the 2006 Ramadan period. The court held that such weight loss was irreparable harm and the requested relief would not disrupt Keen Mountain food service.\n\nOn February 16, 2007, the parties participated in a settlement conference. On March 19, 2007, the parties reached an undisclosed settlement and moved for voluntary dismissal of the claims. Judge Sargent dismissed the case and the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties. The settlement agreement provided plaintiff a $2,250 cash payment and a change in policies surrounding the provision to allow prisoners to celebrate Muslim feasts and their yearly fasts. Prison officials agreed to determine dates for Ramadan in advance by mutual agreement with plaintiff and assistant of an expert from the Islamic Center of Virginia. Further, defendants agreed to not schedule a quarterly lockdown during the Ramadan period, unless emergency necessitated one. \n\nThe settlement did not proceed smoothly. On January 30, 2009, the plaintiff accused the defendants of acting in bad faith and not providing adequate food. However, the record does not indicate what, if any, actions the court or defendants took to address the new allegations. \n\nSince there has been no activity on the docket for over ten years, the case is presumably now closed. \n", "summary": "A Sunni Muslim incarcerated in Virginia Department of Corrections facility (VDOC) brought suit against the officers of the VDOC for failing to provide adequate food to him during his Ramadan fasts and interfering with his participation in post-Ramadan religious events.

{"document": "On December 19, 2014, three Virginia prisoners placed in administrative segregation at Red Onion State Prison, filed this pro-se lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. The plaintiffs sued the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC), various VDOC prison officials, and the External Review Team, Dual Treatment Team, and Unit Management Team of the Virginia Department of Corrections. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Eighth Amendment. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the VDOC Operating Procedure 830.A, a self-described Segregation Reduction Step-Down Program designed to help prisoners progress in stages toward a return to the general prison population, violated plaintiffs’ rights. Specifically, they alleged that they had been assigned to the most restrictive status (“IM”) without adequate due process. Due to their classification, they had also been denied the opportunity to participate in the step down process. They claimed that the IM classified prisoners were treated in a discriminatory manner as compared to other prisoners in administrative segregation, and that these conditions of confinement constituted cruel and unusual punishment. They sought to abolish the procedure, be reassigned to a lower classification, and to be granted monetary damages. \n\nOn January 14, 2015, the plaintiffs moved to certify a class and to appoint counsel. On March 6, 2015, District Judge James P. Jones denied both these motions, finding that the circumstances were not “exceptional” so as to justify appointing counsel. Therefore, because the plaintiffs were still bringing the case pro-se, Judge Jones found it inappropriate to grant class certification. \n\nOn April 8, 2015, Magistrate Judge Robert S. Ballou severed this action into three separate civil suits, one for each plaintiff; the immediate case is for the named plaintiff’s action. Judge Ballou held that the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) required prisoners to file separate filing fees. The purpose of the act was to force “prisoners to think twice” before filing civil litigation. \n\nThe court subsequently filed the original complaint under separate dockets for the two other plaintiffs. Both cases were referred to Magistrate Judge Ballou. He dismissed one case (Velazquez v. Virginia Department of Corrections, 7:15-cv-00157-JPJ-RSB) on September 27, 2016. The plaintiff in the other case (Rivera v. Virginia Department of Corrections, 7:15-cv-00235-JPJ-RSB) moved to voluntarily withdraw his action on May 28, 2015.\n\nOn May 18, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. In it, he alleged that OP 830.A discriminated against IM inmates, who suffered a much more restrictive environment than inmates in other forms of administrative segregation; that IM status permanently prevented an inmate from working his way out of segregated confinement; that officials arbitrarily assigned him to IM status without allowing him to be present or offer argument, contradictory testimony, witnesses, or evidence; that review between the various privilege level status steps was not meaningful; that spiteful officers could falsely report poor behavior or fail to accurately record participation in programming, thus preventing progress to the next step; and that officers routinely approved their own recommendations during the step-down program reviews, in violation of VDOC policy. The plaintiff also complained that OP 830.A affected inmates’ opportunities for parole and earning good conduct time.\n\nOn July 28, 2016 the defendants filed a motion for summary judgement. On September 28, 2016, Judge Jones granted the defendants’ motion. He held that the plaintiff had failed to show that his conditions of confinement were atypical or significantly harsh as compared to conditions expected within a prison environment. Nor, according to Judge Jones, had the plaintiff shown that the procedure violated his due process rights. Moreover, Judge Jones rejected the plaintiff’s equal protection claim because he held that the plaintiff was not similarly situated to the other prisoners in less restrictive confinement. Judge Jones dismissed all claims against the Virginia Department of Corrections as legally frivolous, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1). He held that neither the Commonwealth of Virginia nor any governmental entity acting as an arm of the state, such as the VDOC, was a “person” subject to suit under § 1983. 2016 WL 5415903. \n\nOn October 6, 2016, the plaintiff appealed the district court’s September 28th ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

{"document": "On May 6, 2019, twelve prisoners at the Red Onion and Wallens Ridge supermax prisons, who had each been in solitary confinement for between two and twenty-three years, filed this putative class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The plaintiffs sued the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) and the wardens of both Red Onion and Wallens Ridge under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The plaintiffs - represented by private counsel and the ACLU of Virginia - sought declaratory and injunctive relief in addition to damages. The plaintiffs claimed breach of an earlier settlement agreement and violations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, the Eighth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The plaintiff alleged that VDOC implemented a renamed version of the “Phase Program,” which was supposedly shut down in an earlier settlement, that “warehoused” prisoners in solitary confinement without any opportunity to re-enter general population conditions.\n\nThe earlier settlement had ended the \"Phase Program\" at the Mecklenburg Correctional Center. A class action lawsuit, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=969\">Brown v. Hutto</a>, was filed in 1981, alleging inhumane conditions and constitutional violations by VDOC. A VDOC investigation revealed that Mecklenburg could not fill its solitary confinement beds with its own prisoners. Instead, the prison had solicited other prisons to refer their prisoners for solitary confinement at Mecklenburg. Unlike the Special Management Unit, which housed prisoners unlikely to be reintroduced to the general population, the \"Phase Program\" track was designed to allow solitary confinement prisoners to reenter the general population by earning \"privileges\" for good behavior. But in practice, prisoners were very rarely phased down and prison staff could revoke privileges without oversight or appeals. The parties settled the case in 1985, with VDOC agreeing to end the Phase Program and to not start a similar program in the future. \n\nIn this case, the Red Onion and Wallens Ridge prisoners alleged that the Step-Down Program was used to keep prisoners in solitary confinement in order to utilize solitary confinement space and justify the high cost of keeping both supermax prisons open. This program was alleged to be a new version of the Phase Program used at the since-demolished Mecklenburg facility. The prisoners alleged that staff at each facility were not trained or knowledgeable about the specific requirements of the Step-Down Program, leading them to keep prisoners in solitary confinement despite evidence that they should be stepped down to the general population. These decisions were not subject to meaningful review, and the review process was not appealable. The prisoners alleged this program caused significant mental and physiological harm to each of them and was implemented without any scientific basis. \n\nOn May 31, 2019, VDOC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On June 14, 2019, the remaining defendants also filed a motion to dismiss. Both motions alleged that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. As of October 2, 2019, District Judge Robert E. Payne has not issued a decision on either of these motions.

They alleged that this program also violated an earlier settlement agreement, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The defendants, the Virginia Department of Corrections, its employees, and the wardens of each prison, filed two motions to dismiss. District Judge Robert E.

{"document": "On February 19, 2016, the plaintiff, a Muslim inmate at the Red Onion State Prison, filed this pro se lawsuit alleging a violation of right to free expression in the District Court for the Western District of Virginia. He sued the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) under 28  U.S.C. 2201, 48 U.S.C. 1983, and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). He sought declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctions, costs, damages, and a jury trial.\n\nIn the complaint, the plaintiff contested three specific prison policies that he alleged hindered his ability to practice his Sufi Islamic faith. First, he alleged that the prison's policy for Jum'ah, the weekly Islamic gathering, for inmates in solitary confinement like he is, violated his rights. In the general population, Jum'ah is broadcast in common spaces, but for inmates in solitary confinement, a taped version of Jum'ah is given to inmates with televisions. The plaintiff had neither a television nor a means to get a job that would allow him to purchase a television, since he alleged that he was being kept in solitary confinement as a result of his beard length. His second allegation stemmed from the prison's beard policies, saying that he was unable to grow his beard out to the four inches mandated by his faith due to the prison's quarter-inch beard policy. Finally, he focused on prison food policies, saying that his halal dinners no longer became halal once they entered the contaminated food slot all solitary confinement inmates use, and he was not given facilities to make his food halal again. \n\nJudge James P. Jones denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction on all issues on March 23, 2016, saying that the claims presented in the complaint did not meet the bar of imminent harm. 2016 WL 1179225.  The plaintiff appealed this decision on April 14, 2016. In a December 22, 2016 opinion, the Fourth Circuit upheld the District Court's decision regarding the halal food issue and beard issue, but remanded the Jum'ah decision, saying that the court did not provide specific facts to support its decision. 672 Fed.Appx. 259.\n\nThe case returned to the District Court, and on May 10, 2017, Judge Jones denied the plaintiff's request for preliminary injunctive relief on the issue of Jum'ah. 2017 WL 1929669, W.D. Va. This supported Magistrate Judge Pamela Meade Sargeant's recommendation to not grant injunctive relief on March 20, 2017 (2017 WL 9517164 W.D. Va.). This time, the Judge detailed that, since the prison gave him an option to improve his behavior to allow him to get a job that would pay for a television and the plaintiff did not take it, his religious exercise rights were not being infringed. The plaintiff appealed this decision on June 1, and the Fourth Circuit issued a short memorandum opinion declining to take the case on October 31, saying that it had enough information to uphold the District Court's decision. 699 Fed.Appx. 280.\n\nOn December 15, 2017, Judge Jones issued an opinion on the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which was filed back before the preliminary injunction appeals on July 13, 2016. He denied the motion for the plaintiff's claims under the RLUIPA, saying that the defendants did not counter the plaintiff's allegations that his continued stay in solitary confinement is related to his refusal to trim his beard as his religion instructs, and that this stay is blocking him from accessing televised Jum'ah. However, he granted summary judgment on the First Amendment free exercise claims on the beard, halal food, and Jum'ah policies, saying that these policies were not an undue burden under existing precedent.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended motion for summary judgment addressing the RLUIPA issues on January 12, 2018, stating that the plaintiff remains in solitary confinement for disciplinary infractions unrelated to his beard length. Judge Jones granted this motion for summary judgment on September 19, 2018, saying that the defendants presented enough evidence to support this motion this time. 2018 WL 4512074, W.D. Va.\n\nThe plaintiff appealed this summary judgment decision on October 23, 2018. The Fourth Circuit vacated the summary judgment motion and remanded the case on December 6, 2019, saying that the VDOC's use of access to television for religious services as an incentive program unduly burdens the plaintiff's rights to practice a bona fide religious belief. The panel stated that religious practice should be a right, not a privilege that can be taken away through an incentive program. 944 F.3d 243.\n\nThe case returned to District Court, where the defendants could file another motion for summary judgment consistent with the Fourth Circuit's ruling. The case is ongoing as of May 25, 2020.", "summary": "In 2016, the plaintiff filed a pro se complaint in the District Court for the Western District of Virginia against the Virginia Department of Corrections alleging that their policies for beards, halal food, and television access for religious services for inmates in solitary confinement violated the Free Exercise Clause and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. Judge John P. Jones denied the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief in 2017 and initially granted summary judgment in favor of VDOC in 2018, but the Fourth Circuit overturned him on appeal in late 2019, saying that VDOC's use of access to television for religious services as an incentive program unduly burdens the plaintiff's rights to practice a bona fide religious belief. The panel stated that religious practice should be a right, not a privilege that can be taken away through an incentive program. The case is ongoing."}
{"document": "After a two-year investigation initiated in December 2016 under CRIPA and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a Notice on December 19, 2018 concluding that the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (“HRRJ”)  failed to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care to prisoners and placed prisoners with serious mental illness in restrictive housing for prolonged periods of time. The DOJ also concluded that HRRJ’s housing practices discriminate against prisoners with mental health disabilities in violation of the ADA.\n\nIn the Notice, the DOJ set forth factual findings about the conditions at HRRJ that violated prisoners’ constitutional rights.  Principally, the DOJ found that medical and mental health care at HRRJ was constitutionally inadequate.  In all stages of medical and mental health care (including patient intake, chronic care and emergency care, treatment and therapy, continuity of care, and security and care for suicidal prisoners), the quality of care and access to care was found to be severely deficient, subjecting prisoners to a serious risk of harm due to delays and lack of care.  The DOJ also found a lack of oversight and accountability and a deliberate indifference by HRRJ officials in identifying and mitigating risks.  Furthermore, HRRJ utilized prolonged restrictive housing which disparately affects prisoners with mental illnesses, thereby denying them access to activities and programming that they would otherwise be eligible for, and putting them at risk for serious harm.  Officials at HRRJ knew of these substantial shortcomings and the associated risks and failed to take appropriate action.\n\nOn August 5, 2020, the DOJ filed this lawsuit against HRRJ in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia based on the findings in the December 2018 report and HRRJ’s subsequent failure to take sufficient remedial steps.  The DOJ alleges that HRRJ’s policies and practices violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of prisoners.  As a result, the DOJ asked Judge Rebecca Beach Smith to declare that HRRJ’s practices violated the constitutional rights of prisoners and violated the ADA, and to enjoin HRRJ to take immediate action to amend its policies and practices to ensure that lawful conditions of confinement are afforded to prisoners.  \n\nBy the time that the complaint was filed, the parties had already negotiated a settlement.  On the same day as the complaint was filed, the parties filed a joint settlement motion.  In the settlement agreement, HRRJ agreed to implement a comprehensive list of reforms including appropriate screening and assessment for medical and mental health needs by qualified professionals, adequate treatment planning for medical and mental health concerns, suicide prevention practices, specialized mental health housing units, oversight of restrictive housing placement, increased medical and mental health staff, increased training for staff, increased collaboration between mental health staff and jail leadership, and a Quality Assurance program to identify and correct deficiencies with the medical and mental health care system to be overseen by a Quality Assurance Committee which will provide monthly reports to the monitor and the DOJ. \n\nThe settlement agreement noted that HRRJ would designate an Agreement Coordinator to coordinate compliance with the agreement.  HRRJ agreed to create annual Implementation Plans to describe how it will fulfill its obligations under the agreement, including deadlines within the first year by which HRRJ must draft or revise policies and procedures, complete a staffing plan, develop and deliver training to HRRJ staff, develop and implement a Quality Improvement Committee, and develop and implement monthly quality assurance mechanisms to report on data relevant to prevent to prevent or minimize harm to prisoners. \n\nA key provision of the settlement agreement was the mandatory appointment of an independent third-party monitor, to oversee HRRJ’s compliance with the agreement.  The monitor was agreed to be retained for a period of three years and provide biannual status reports to the DOJ, HRRJ and the court.  The monitor would also undertake compliance reviews, on-site inspections and issue monitor reports every six months to assess compliance and HRRJ’s progress on the various reform efforts.  The reports will also be filed with the court.  In the event of noncompliance with the agreement, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia retains jurisdiction to enforce the agreement at the request of the DOJ.  \n\nOn August 31, 2020, the court approved the settlement agreement and subsequently, on September 10, 2020, the court approved the appointment of James Conrad Welch to be the third-party monitor.  The settlement agreement is effective as of August 31, 2020.\n\nBy the terms of the agreement, HRRJ will implement all provisions of the agreement within four years and the agreement will terminate in five years, so long as HRRJ has attained substantial compliance with the agreement and maintained that compliance for at least one year.  HRRJ will have the burden to prove that it has achieved and maintained substantial compliance with the agreement and has been operating in accordance with the requirements of the ADA and the U.S. Constitution continuously for one year.  The agreement will terminate by order of the court.\n\nAs such, this case remains ongoing.", "summary": "On August 31, 2020, Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia approved a settlement between the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Rights Division and Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority.

Under the agreement, HRRJ will develop and implement policies, procedures, and training regarding adequate medical and mental health care and appropriate housing for prisoners with serious mental illness.  These measures include specialized mental health housing units, increased training for medical, mental health, and security personnel, proper screening and assessment for medical and mental health concerns, adequate treatment planning and suicide prevention measures, and a quality assurance program.

The prisoners, who went untreated or under-treated for serious ailments, including kidney failure, kidney stones, hernia, and chronic and substantial pain, alleged that the denial of care while incarcerated constituted cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. The Washington DOC only administered direct medical care for \"medically necessary\" conditions. All others required approval by a Department of Corrections Care Review Committee (CRC) consisting of doctors and other medical professionals across the state. Of all petitions for care, about 60% were being denied by the CRC. And complaints of chronic and substantial pain were ignored.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought (1) a declaration that the Washington DOC's policies and practices governing the approval of medical care requests by DOC providers and outside specialists violate the Eighth Amendment; (2) a preliminary and permanent injunction restraining the DOC from denying, without reasonable medical justification, necessary care for class members' serious medical needs; and (3) reasonable attorney's fees. The plaintiffs also sought to certify the following class: \"All current and future prisoners, incarcerated under the jurisdiction of the Washington Department of Corrections, whose access to necessary medical care has been denied, or will be subject to denial, under the Department’s policies and practices governing access to health care requiring prior approval.\"\n\nJudge Richard A. Jones denied class certification on September 18, 2017, holding that the proposed class lacked the necessary commonality for class certification. The court found that the plaintiffs had \"not adequately identified common policies and practices to show that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to inmates’ needs.\" The plaintiffs sought to appeal the decision, but the Ninth Circuit denied their petition to appeal on December 21, 2017.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed to amend the complaint in March 2018 to reflect a new Secretary of the DOC. Later in June 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to stay the proceedings of the case for six months while the parties tried to resolve the case.

The plaintiffs, represented by Columbia Legal Services, alleged that King County has violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (20 U.S.C. § 1400), by holding children in solitary confinement at King County’s Maleng Regional Justice Center. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief to end King County’s solitary confinement policy. \n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that King County denied these children, who had not yet been convicted of any crimes, meaningful social interaction and education by holding them in isolation cells for weeks or months on end. These children were given only a few minutes of face-to-face educational instruction and denied access to reading or writing materials. The plaintiffs alleged that these deprivations could cause trauma, depression, anxiety, as well as permanent interference with a child’s psychological and social development. The vast majority of children affected by King County’s actions were children of color and many suffered from mental illness. \n\nThe plaintiffs amended the complaint on October 23, 2017 to add additional named plaintiffs and an additional claim of discrimination. \n\nThe plaintiffs sought to certify a class of all children currently incarcerated at the RJC and all such children who would be held there in the future.

The plaintiffs, represented by pro bono private counsel, sought a declaratory judgment that Colorado violated the Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments by deferring the appointment of counsel to indigent defendants.

{"document": "This is a case about protestors being detained and arrested in downtown Los Angeles between November 24-26, 2014. On January 12, 2016, four protestors represented by private counsel and the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) filed this § 1983 class action suit against the City of Los Angeles in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs sought preliminary and permanent injunctions against the City and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), declaratory judgments that their rights had been violated, nullification of the arrests, and various damages and attorney’s fees. They claimed that the LAPD had violated their First Amendment rights through unlawful detention during a protest; that they were unreasonably detained, searched, and arrested in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights; that not being permitted release on recognizance while held in custody based on a perceived affiliation with nation-wide protests and purported engagement in “civil disobedience” violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process; and that their right to privacy under California state law was violated by compulsory disclosure and subsequent upload to a nationwide protestor database of personal information.\n\nThe protestors were marching in response to a grand jury’s refusal to indict a police officer for the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. At some point during the demonstration, protestors were kettled in by LAPD officers and prevented from leaving. The protest was deemed unlawful because it was blocking motorists, but plaintiffs contended in their complaint that the only traffic interference originated from the LAPD. The captain of the police then issued a “dispersal order,” informing them they would only be let go after individual questioning. Few of the protestors heard this order (the complaint states that the LAPD captain later admitted it was “inadequate”). The subsequent questioning involved being restrained in zip ties, patted down and searched, recorded on video, and forced to provide private identifying information.\n\nThis was not the first time the City and LAPD had been sued for similar practices. In 2005, the City agreed to a settlement in a lawsuit (<i>National Lawyers Guild v. City of Los Angeles</i>) brought by NLG that provided the LAPD would no longer prevent sidewalk protests, would not kettle protestors using their motorcycles, and would attempt to arrest individuals responsible for any unlawful conduct prior to declaring an unlawful assembly. The City had to settle again in 2009, stipulating that it would facilitate protests that may temporarily block traffic and set specific requirements for declaring an unlawful assembly. For more information, see <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11347\">MIWON v. City of Los Angeles</a></i>. The complaint in this case alleged that the City had repeatedly failed to train its officers to adhere to any of these provisions, all of which were violated during the protests.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for class certification on July 14, 2016. The court granted their motion in part on May 25, 2017. It certified a class entitled to seek damages defined as the \"approximately 130 persons who were detained and arrested at 6th and Hope Streets on November 26, 2014, denied release on their own recognizance but never prosecuted.\" But the court declined to certify a class of protestors at a different intersection because the putative class representative was an NLG observer rather than a protester. It also declined to certify a class for injunctive relief consisting of all past and future protestors because \"no objective criteria\" existed to determine membership. 2017 WL 10776036.\n\nOn February 27, 2017, the parties began court-ordered mediation. However, after over a year of failure to agree on a settlement, the parties were ordered into private mediation on July 8, 2018.\n\nThe parties agreed to a provisional settlement on January 10, 2019, which after some modification Judge John A. Kronstadt approved on May 11, 2020. The plaintiffs were awarded a total of $750,000. $215,878.51 was put in a settlement fund for distribution to class members; $20,000 was awarded to the class representatives; and $476,801.93 was granted as attorney’s fees (the rest went to various court fees). Injunctive relief was not part of the settlement. The case is now closed.

{"document": "This is a case about harm caused by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) misclassifying residents as gang members or gang associates. On August 2, 2020, five residents of Los Angeles filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. They sued the City of Los Angeles under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by attorneys from the Justice X Law Group, the plaintiffs sought damages for harms that arose from being falsely linked to gang activity, including imprisonment, excessive charging, job loss, inability to acquire housing, and loss of access to financial aid for college. Plaintiffs asserted that they were subjected to unnecessary and outrageous searches and seizures that violated the Fourth Amendment; that they were unlawfully confined in violation of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause; and that the City of Los Angeles was responsible for and complicit in these LAPD policies.\n\nMuch of the alleged misconduct in this case arose from section 186.22 of the California Penal Code (CPC). That law enhances sentences for crimes committed in association with a gang. Plaintiffs alleged that, since its inception, officers have abused it by knowingly or recklessly misclassifying people as gang members or gang associates while charging them with minor crimes to support convictions. Plaintiffs alleged they were misclassified for visiting family in a neighborhood with gang-related activity or having a cousin who was an alleged gang member. The magnitude of this abuse became clear in 2016 when, according to plaintiffs' complaint, a state audit found that California’s statewide gang association database (CalGangs) contained abundant “questionable entries and errors such as the inclusion of year-old children.”\n\nThe issues of false classifications led to the California Department of Justice suspending CalGangs in June of 2020 and revoking LAPD’s access to it in July of 2020. The L.A. County District Attorney’s Office filed a criminal complaint against three LAPD officers on July 9, 2020 for conspiring to falsify police reports and fabricate court documents. An LAPD memorandum confirmed that as of July 10, 2020 twenty-four LAPD officers are under investigation for similar charges.\n\nThe case is ongoing as of September 13, 2020.", "summary": "In 2020, residents of Los Angeles filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

{"document": "This class-action lawsuit was filed on July 1, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The suit came in response to police tactics used to quell protests in Denver that followed the police killing of George Floyd in May of 2020. Plaintiffs, seven private individuals, were represented by the civil rights law firm Loevy & Loevy and brought this suit against the city and county of Denver, as well as 10 anonymous officers of Denver Police Department (called Does 1-10). The class-action suit established two separate, putative classes: the Arrest Class, made up of those who were arrested in the protests, and the Direct Force Class, composed of protesters who suffered injuries from police using weapons.\n\nThe suit alleged that on May 28, 2020 the Denver Police used weapons like tear gas, flashbang grenades, pepper spray, pepper balls, and rubber bullets on peaceful protesters. According to the complaint, these actions violated the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The First Amendment count claimed that the defendants' actions violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of Free Speech and Freedom to Petition. They also argued that the city's curfew itself was unlawfully executed because it only applied to protesters and not to non-protesters. The Fourth Amendment count argued that the defendants' actions in arresting and firing weapons at protesters constituted unreasonable search and seizure and excessive force. Finally, the Fourteenth Amendment count claimed that defendants violated the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. Specifically, the Direct Force Class was denied Due Process when the police fired weapons at them \"indiscriminately\" and the Arrest Class was denied Due Process and Equal Protection when the police arrested them for violation of curfew, according to the complaint. Plaintiffs sought class certification, declaratory relief, injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from further violations, and general and punitive damages. They also sought attorney's fees and costs. \n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Michael E. Hegarty. \n\nA week later, plaintiffs submitted a notice of related cases, citing two cases with common facts and claims and with at least one party in common: <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17595\"><i>Abay v.

{"document": "On August 4, 2014, a 71-year old grandmother living in Washington, DC filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the District of Columbia. The plaintiff, represented by the non-profit organization Equal Justice Under Law, sought compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees, claiming that her constitutional rights were violated. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the police verbally and physically abused her during a search of her home that was conducted despite the fact that she was under no suspicion of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe incident happened on October 27, 2012 when two officers were on patrol and passed the plaintiff's home and saw three men near her property \"outside the fence line.\" One of the men was the plaintiff's grandson. After conversing with the men, the three were arrested for possession of an open container of alcohol and possession of synthetic marijuana.  A handgun was also found. One of the other men admitted that all of the illicit items belonged to him and no charges were pressed against the plaintiff's grandson. \n\nEven though no charges were pressed against the plaintiff's grandson, the police sought to search the plaintiff's home on the basis that there might have been evidence related to illegal firearms in the home. According to the plaintiff's complaint, the search warrant application was vague and did not specify any specific reason for searching the home. Furthermore, the complaint alleges that the basis given for the warrant was inadequate. \n\nBoth before and after obtaining the warrant, the plaintiff alleged that she was kept from entering her home and treated abusively by the police. After the search did not turn up anything illegal, the plaintiff claims that she reentered her home to find that it had been torn apart by the police. \n\nOn September 16, 2014, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. They argued that the officers' conduct was lawful, that the officers conduct was protected by qualified immunity, and that plaintiff failed to allege a <i>Monell</i> claim against the Metropolitan Police Department. \n\nThe plaintiff filed an amended complaint on September 25, 2015, which added several officer defendants to the action. \n\nOn September 30, 2016, Judge Randolph D. Moss ruled on the defendants' motion to dismiss, granting in part and denying in part. 211 F. Supp. 3d 150 (D.D.C. 2016). Specifically, the Court found that the officers had failed to establish the following: (1) that the firearm found gave them probable cause to conduct a warrantless arrest; (2) that the protective sweep of the home was lawful; and (3) that the application for the warrant for the subsequent search was supported by probable cause. The Court did find, however, that all defendants who executed the search except for one acted lawfully. Finally, the Court found that the plaintiff's complaint adequately alleged that the purportedly unconstitutional search of the home was the result of the District's \"pattern policy, and practice\" of an affiant officer falsely claiming that his training and experience led him to believe that evidence of a crime would be present. \n\nOn May 1, 2017, the parties stipulated to a dismissal of the case pursuant to a private settlement agreement.

Protesters had gathered as part of the nationwide outcry following the police killing of George Floyd. Around 6:30 in the evening, following an order to clear the square from Attorney General Barr, military and federal police forces used tear gas, pepper spray capsules, rubber bullets, and flash bombs to disperse the protesters in order to clear the path for President Trump to walk to nearby St. John's Church for a photo-op. \n\nPlaintiffs were represented by attorneys from Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, ACLU D.C., Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, and private counsel. Named defendants included President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Barr, and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, as well as the heads of several military and law enforcement agencies. The plaintiffs also sued unnamed officers, members, and agents of the U.S. Park Police, the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Armed Forces, the Arlington County Police Department, and other federal and non-federal law enforcement agencies. The complaint alleged violations of the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, 42 U.S.C. 1985(3) (conspiracy to deprive rights), and 42 U.S.C. 1986 (failure to prevent conspiracy to deprive rights). Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief; compensatory and punitive damages, including damages for pain and suffering; and attorney's fees. \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Dabney L.

{"document": "On November 24, 2009, patrons of Atlanta Eagle, a gay bar in Atlanta, Georgia, filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of Atlanta, the chief of police, and officers of the Atlanta Police Department in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division. The plaintiffs, represented by private lawyer Dan Grossman, and public interest lawyers from Lambda Legal Defense and the Southern Center for Human Rights, asked the Court for damages and declaratory and injunctive relief to redress defendants' violations of plaintiffs' rights under the U.S. Constitution and Georgia Constitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that the police action was taken without any particularized reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that any individual was involved in any criminal activity. The plaintiffs also sought redress for the numerous state law torts committed by individual defendants, including false imprisonment, assault, battery, and trespass.\n\nAccording to the complaint, on September 10 and 11, 2009, a paramilitary, SWAT-type force of Atlanta police officers entered the Atlanta Eagle without a warrant, claiming to be searching for public sex, drugs, and illegal weapons. The police forced dozens of bar patrons to lie face-down on the floor, which was covered with spilled beer, dirt, and broken glass. Officers allegedly made threats of violence and anti-gay slurs. Plaintiffs claim that although they were not suspected of any criminal activity, police officers emptied their pockets, confiscated their IDs, and entered every patron's name into a police computer. After the raid, not a single patron was charged with any crime, and no weapons, drugs, or evidence of sex was found.\n\nIn December 2010, the parties reached a settlement that required the Atlanta Police Department to rewrite their policies regarding arrest, search, and seizure, and to make other changes to protect the public from police misconduct. The settlement required, among other provisions: <ul> <li>Changes in search and seizure policy to accord with a set of legal principles spelled out in the settlement, covering the requirements for arrests, stops, and searches. </li> <li>All Atlanta police officers in uniform must wear a conspicuously visible nametag, and any Atlanta police officer who is in uniform or has displayed a badge or other indicia of police authority must identify himself by name and badge number upon request at some point before the end of an encounter with a civilian.</li> <li>Atlanta police officers may not interfere in any way with a citizen's right to record police activity</li> <li>Payment of $1,025,000 by the City of Atlanta. </li></ul> \nJudge Timothy C. Batten, Sr. issued an order to approve the settlement agreement on December 8, 2010. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the City of Atlanta's compliance with the terms of the settlement if it failed to implement the actions set forth in the settlement agreement within 180 days of the entry of the order. \n\nOn June 16, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions on the grounds that the Atlanta Police Department had not implemented the police reform policies outlined in the settlement agreement. The police department agreed to implement the policies if plaintiffs withdrew their motion for sanctions. \n\nAfter three years of inactivity, on March 17, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt sanctions on the grounds that the police department had still not implemented police reform policies. The plaintiffs requested post-judgment discovery. On May 19, 2015, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion. \n\nIn response to a joint motion by the parties, the court ordered the appointment of a special master, Joe D. Whitley, on June 22, 2016 to monitor the Atlanta Police Department's compliance with court orders and assist the parties in addressing any obstacles with compliance or relevant discovery. On September 23, 2016, the court granted the parties' Consent Order Setting Forth Initial Special Master Monitoring, Discovery, and Dispute Resolution Procedures. The consent order laid out detailed procedures for ensuring compliance and a feedback mechanism for the creation of a civil rights training program. The consent order also provided a detailed monitoring scheme. Further, all post-judgment discovery requests were stayed without prejudice. \n\nIn two 2016 status reports, Mr. Whitley found that the police department had complied or attempted in good faith to comply with the requirements of the court order. However, after six months, it became clear that there were existing areas of disagreement between the parties regarding the following elements of the court order: (1) the identification requirement for officers; (2) the requirement of no interference with audio or video recordings; (3) documentation of warrantless seizures and identification checks; and (4)  timely resolution of citizen complaints. But at that point, Mr. Whitley still believed that all of the issues could be resolved, particularly through increased communication between the parties. \n\nAfter nine months had passed, however, Mr. Whitley determined that there were fundamental disagreements between the parties regarding the court order's requirements and how compliance should be evaluated. At Mr. Whitley's urging, on July 25, 2017, the Court issued two orders: one requiring that the police department show cause why it should not be held in contempt for violating the court order and another requiring that the department show cause as to why it is entitled to relief from any of the court order's provisions. \n\nOn September 25, 2017, the police department filed a motion to disqualify the special master and reassign matters to the district court, as well as an emergency motion to stay the special master's activities. However, the court did not grant the emergency motion and the special master continued to carry out his responsibilities. And on November 28, 2017, the court denied the police department's motion to disqualify the special master and adopted his October 2017 status report.\n\nOn February 12, 2018, the court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by responding to the police department's emergency petition. The court called for briefing and a special master report and recommendation on the issue of whether the attorneys' fees sought were reasonable. \n\nThroughout 2018, the parties engaged in extensive settlement discussions with the goal of reaching an agreement with respect to the show cause order on contempt issues and the police department's compliance with the original settlement agreement. They proposed a new consent order on November 28, 2018, and the court approved it the following day. \n\nThe order required the police department to modify 1) training procedures; 2) standard operating procedures; 3) handing citizen complaints; 4) \"stop and think\" forms; and 5) identification procedures. It also provided the plaintiffs the right to engage in post-judgment discovery, and the right to address any failure to comply in court. Additionally, the city agreed to pay the plaintiffs attorneys' fees. \n\nThe case remains open such that the parties may resume litigation if the defendants fail to comply with the consent order.

{"document": "On October 21, 2004, a group of former Chicago Police Department (CPD) detainees filed this class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the CPD. Represented by the Chicago civil rights law firm Loevy & Loevy, the plaintiffs alleged that the CPD were engaged in a unconstitutional pattern and practice of detaining persons under its control for excessive periods of time and under poor conditions. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the Department routinely and secretly detained suspects in police station interrogation rooms for lengthy periods of time, up to 48 hours without sleep or food, in attempts to develop legal grounds for detaining them. These unlawful detentions, plaintiffs alleged, amounted to physical and psychological \"soft torture\" and produced scores of false confessions. Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and class certification.\n\nOn June 13, 2005, the plaintiffs moved for certification of three separate classes: (1) those subjected to interrogation room detentions for over 16 hours; (2) those held in the department lock-up and deprived of adequate accommodations for sleep; and (3) those detained by police for over 48 hours without a probable cause hearing. Defendants objected to certification of Class I and III, but consented to certification of Class II.\n\nOn October 5, 2005, U.S. District Judge Robert W. Gettleman granted plaintiffs' motion with respect to the Class II and III. Class II was defined as: \"All persons held in a CPD lock-up or detective division facility between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. at any time from October 12, 2002, to the date of this order.\" Class III was defined as: \"All persons arrested on suspicion of a felony without an arrest warrant and who were detained by the CPD in excess of 48 hours without a judicial probable cause hearing at any time from August 15, 1999, to the date of this order.\" Judge Gettleman denied certification as to first class because the claims of the only proposed representative of the first class was barred by the statute of limitations. 231 F.R.D. 367 (N.D.Ill. Oct 05, 2005). The plaintiffs later added a new representative for Class I and renewed their motion to certify this class. Judge Gettleman granted the motion on June 2, 2006.\n\nWhile the certification issues were being resolved by the court, the parties engaged in substantial discovery. Many disputes arose, causing the parties to appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sidney I. Schenkier over 20 times. The CPD was ordered to produce, among other materials, computerized arrest data and a sampling of 3,000 paper arrest records. The plaintiffs used the arrest data to create a database which would be used to identify the members of the various classes.\n\nJudge Schenkier held a series of settlement conferences beginning on September 21, 2006 and continuing over the next year. On October 6, 2010, the Court gave final approval of the negotiated class action settlement. The defendants were required to fund a settlement fund of up to $16.5 million to pay settlement class members. The agreement specified the following awards for each class:\n\n• Members of Class I (detained for longer than 16 hours) were eligible for an award of up to $2,000;\n• Members of Class II (detained overnight without adequate accommodations for sleep) were eligible for an award of up to $90; and\n• Members of Class III (detained for longer than 48 hours without a probable cause hearing) were eligible for an award of up to $3,000.\n\nThe defendants were also required to pay for all costs related to the claims administration for the settlement. The agreement also allowed for an attorneys' fee award not to exceed $5 million, and attorneys' costs and expenses not to exceed $70,000.\n\nOn April 19, 2013, Judge Schenkier issued an order stating that the entirety of damages had been paid and any remainder of the settlement fund would be returned to the City of Chicago.", "summary": "In a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the plaintiffs challenged Chicago Police Department's alleged unconstitutional pattern and practice of detaining persons under its control for excessive periods of time and under conditions plaintiffs claimed reached the level of \"soft torture.\" This case settled on October 6, 2010 for $16.5 million."}
{"document": "On March 19, 2015, three men arrested in Chicago, IL filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs sued the City of Chicago and Chicago police officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by a private firm, asked the court for compensatory and punitive damages. They claimed that the City of Chicago and police officers violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Chicago police officers had subjected them to false arrest at the Homan Square detention facility, excessive use of force, and illegal searches; attempted to coerce them into false confessions without an attorney present; and threatened them that they would be charged with crimes if they did not provide information.\n\nThe Guardian, a UK-based newspaper, profiled conditions in Homan Square through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/homan-square\">a series of articles</a> starting in early 2015. Documents filed later in this case mention that the press coverage inspired the plaintiffs to come forward with this lawsuit.\n\nOn May 13, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Primarily, the defendants claimed that plaintiffs' complaint was untimely and that the allegation that the police had threatened plaintiffs into not speaking about their experience was not enough to defeat the statute of limitations. On May 27, 2015, Judge Andrea R. Wood granted the defendants' motion to stay discovery pending the resolution of the motion to dismiss. \n\nOn March 31, 2016, Judge Wood granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in a minute order. However, Judge Wood did not issue a Memorandum Opinion and Order on the motion to dismiss until January 31, 2018. The docket does not explain the reason for this large gap in time. Given the unusual gap without a written dismissal order, the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(7)(A)(ii) dictates that a dismissal order is assumed to be filed 150 days after judgment is entered into the docket.\n\nIn the opinion, Judge Wood held that the case should be dismissed because the complaint was filed after the statute of limitations had expired and the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not apply to the circumstances. Specifically, Judge Wood held that although the plaintiffs adequately alleged facts establishing the first two elements of equitable estoppel—that the defendants acted affirmatively to prevent them from filing suit and the plaintiffs did actually and reasonably rely on the threats while they were made—the plaintiffs did not file suit promptly after the obstacle to filing was removed and therefore failed to adequately allege facts establishing the third element of equitable estoppel.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, the plaintiffs appealed Judge's Wood decision granting the defendants' motion to dismiss to the Seventh Circuit. On August 17, 2018, the defendants submitted a docketing statement arguing that the plaintiffs failed to file a timely notice of appeal as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(7)(A)(ii). They argued that the district court entered a dispositive order on the docket on March 31, 2016, meaning that the plaintiffs' notice of appeal filed on February 6, 2018 was more than 30 days after the entry of judgment. \n\nA Seventh Circuit panel composed of Judges Daniel Anthony Manion, Diane S. Skyes, and Michael B. Brennan sided with the appellees in a September 30, 2019 opinion. 939 F.3d 882. They wrote that the appellants should have filed their motion to appeal within 30 days of the dismissal order, which came 150 days after the March 30, 2016 minute order dismissing the case. They did not agree with the plaintiff's argument that they should have been allowed to appeal when the written opinion was published. In addition, the panel briefly discussed the merits of the case, and wrote that this case was not filed within the statute of limitations and that equitable estoppel did not apply. They referred back to previous cases in the Seventh Circuit that held that police intimidation was not sufficient to invoke equitable estoppel, and added that the Guardian articles providing \"a newfound sense of security\" to come forward was not enough to overcome that precedent, either.\n\nThe plaintiffs did not appeal the decision to the Supreme Court; the case is now closed.", "summary": "On March 19, 2015 three Chicago residents filed suit against the City of Chicago and several members of the Chicago Police Department for unlawful arrest and detention and excessive use of force at the Homan Square detention facility.

On March 31, 2016, the Court granted the defendants motion to dismiss; the dismissal order came 150 days later, though a written opinion and order came down on January 31, 2018. The plaintiffs appealed the Court's decision to grant the motion to dismiss to the Seventh Circuit after the written order was issued. A Seventh Circuit panel agreed with the district court on September 30, 2019; they wrote that the appeal was not filed in a timely manner, and that the underlying case was filed after the statute of limitations had passed.

The complaint argued that these actions represented violations of the U.S. Constitution and common law tort law.

{"document": "On June 12, 2003, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the City of Detroit. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141, the DOJ alleged a pattern or practice of unconstitutional misconduct by officers of the Detroit Police Department (DPD), including the excessive use of force, false arrest, improper warrantless searches and failure to protect detainees. Contemporaneously with the filing of the DOJ's complaint, the parties filed a proposed consent decree and motion to appoint an independent monitor.\n\nThe filing followed a DOJ investigation of the DPD which revealed concerns about excessive force, holding cell conditions and arrest and detention policies and practices.\n\nA day after the filing of the complaint, the City of Detroit filed a motion to stay entry of the consent judgment until its City Council could formally approve it. The Detroit City Council then filed a motion to intervene in the action on June 18, 2003. On July 1, 2003, the Coalition Against Police Brutality filed a motion to intervene as of right. U.S. District Judge Julian Abele Cook Jr. denied both intervention motions on July 14, 2003.\n\nOn July 18, 2003, Judge Cook granted the parties' motions to appoint a monitor and approve the consent judgment and motion to amend the consent judgment. Judge Cook entered two separate consent judgments: one relating to the \"Use of Force and Arrest and Witness Detention\" and the other relating to \"Conditions of Confinement.\" On July 23, 2003, Judge Cook appointed Sheryl L. Robinson, with the assistance of Kroll, Inc., as the independent monitor.\n\nOn October 15, 2003, the Coalition Against Police Brutality filed a notice of appeal, but the appeal was subsequently dismissed for a reason that is not apparent.\n\nOn December 27, 2004, Judge Cook issued an order extending the duration of the \"Conditions of Confinement\" consent decree to July 18, 2007. The other consent decree relating to \"Use of Force and Arrest and Witness Detention\" was conditionally set to expire by its terms in July 2008. On October 26, 2007, however both consent decrees were extended by Judge Cook until July 18, 2011.\n\nThe independent monitor, Sheryl Robinson Wood, issued quarterly reports from the time of her appointment. Each report contains a \"report card\" as an appendix, summarizing the monitor's evaluation of DPD compliance with the various consent judgment provisions.\n\nOn July 24, 2009, Judge Cook accepted the resignation of the Monitor, on the basis of documents that demonstrated that \"she had engaged in conduct which was totally inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the two Consent Judgments in this litigation.\" In particular, she had \"engaged in undisclosed communications, as well as meetings of a personal nature,\" with the former Mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick.\n\nJudge Cook suspended decree monitoring until selection of a new monitor, which occurred on October 5, 2009 when Judge Cook appointed Robert Warsaw to the position.\n\nThroughout the course of this litigation, the parties amended their consent decrees several times so that the defendants could more easily comply with the terms. However, on April 19, 2010, Judge Cook issued an order requiring the Defendants to resolve all of its backlogged citizen complaints within a period of 90 days. The defendants asked for several extensions, and ultimately achieved compliance in March of 2011.\n\nHowever, as of January 2012, there were over 400 backlogged complaints, which has reopened this facet of the litigation as this number was \"totally unacceptable,\" according to Judge Cook. Judge Cook then issued an order on January 30, 2012, requiring the Defendants to fix the backlog of complaints. On April 23, 2012, the parties filed another Amended Consent Decree, amending various portions of the consent judgments related to the use of force and conditions of confinement.\n\nOn July 19, 2013, Judge Cook issued an order with respect to the consent judgments after becoming aware that the individual identified as responsible for the Conditions of Confinement Consent Judgment was no longer employed by the DPD. Judge Cook ordered the defendants to identify the head of the DPD's Civil Rights Integrity Bureau (CRIB), and required that the DPD notify the court and monitor before making any personnel changes within CRIB. Judge Cook also noted that with the appointment of Kevyn Orr as Emergency Manager for the City of Detroit, the line of authority might have been complicated. Thus, Judge Cook also required the City of Detroit provide an updated description of the line of authority to clarify accountability with respect to the enforcement of the consent judgements. The defendants filed their response to Judge Cook's order on July 26, 2013.\n\nOn July 29, 2013, Judge Cook issued an order extending the Conditions of Confinement Consent Judgment in light of the DPD's plan to transfer custody of its detainees to the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC). Once the monitor was satisfied with the decommissioning of the DPD's holding cells, Judge Cook would dismiss the Conditions of Confinement Consent Judgment. On December 11, 2013, the monitor submitted a report confirming compliance with the Conditions of Confinement Consent Judgment, and Judge Cook subsequently dismissed this consent judgment on January 27, 2014.\n\nOn December 19, 2013, Judge Cook issued a new order for \"enhanced monitoring.\" Judge Cook acknowledged that substantial progress had been made with respect to enforcement of the consent judgments, as the City of Detroit was now in compliance with 93% of the consent judgment requirements. However, Judge Cook also noted that the City was still out of compliance with 12% of the Use of Force Consent Judgment requirements. As such, Judge Cook directed the monitor to increase the frequency of visits to the City in order to expedite enforcement of the Use of Force Consent Judgment.\n\nOn December 22, 2013, the defendants moved to suspend monitoring of provisions of the Use of Force and Arrest and Witness Detention Consent Judgment which have been in compliance for two or more years. However, on June 16, 2014, Judge Cook denied the motion, finding that there were no changes in circumstances which warranted a revision of the consent judgment.\n\nOn May 14, 2014, due to his impending transition to inactive status, Judge Cook ordered that this case be reassigned to another judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The case was eventually assigned to U.S. District Judge Avery Cohn on June 16, 2014.\n\nOn August 8, 2014, the parties jointly moved to terminate the remaining consent judgment, arguing that the intent of the consent judgment had been substantially satisfied. The parties noted that the independent monitor found 90% overall compliance, and any remaining compliance could be achieved through a transition agreement under which the DOJ could maintain oversight of the DPD's ongoing reform efforts without the direct oversight of an independent monitor. On August 25, 2014, Judge Cohn granted the motion terminating the consent judgment, and entered the transition agreement as an order terminating on March 2, 2016. Judge Cohn also provided final comments with respect to the order, suggesting that control of the DPD be transferred away from the Emergency Manager and back to the mayor of Detroit. Judge Cohn also suggested that the Board of Police Commissioners continue as a civilian review body dealing with complaints.\n\nThis case is effectively closed.", "summary": "This is a case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice to remedy an alleged pattern or practice of unconstitutional misconduct by the Detroit Police Department, including the excessive use of force, false arrest, improper warrantless searches and failure to protect detainees.

The plaintiffs, represented by private and public interest counsel, sought compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that the City of Ferguson and the County of St. Louis, through their police forces, violated the plaintiffs' rights by subjecting them to unnecessary and unwarranted force and arresting them without probable cause. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged claims of false arrest, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, failure to train, supervise, and discipline, as well as assault and battery.\n\nThis suit was filed in the wake of the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown. Brown, a black male, was fatally shot on August 9, 2014, by Darren Wilson, a Caucasian police officer with the Ferguson Police Department. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are disputed, but it is undisputed that Brown was unarmed at the time. The shooting sparked protests and general civil unrest in the City of Ferguson, caused in part by racial tension between the majority-black community and the majority-white city government and police.  The plaintiffs alleged that during this time of civil unrest, Ferguson police officers used wanton and excessive force under color of law. \n\nSpecifically, one plaintiff alleged that she and her son were arrested on August 13 at a fast-food restaurant in Ferguson. The complaint states that they had attended a peace rally and were arrested for supposedly failing to follow police instructions to leave the establishment. Another plaintiff claimed he was shot with rubber bullets, assaulted, and sprayed with pepper-spray by police while heading to his mother's house on August 13. According to the complaint, this plaintiff was never charged with a crime. Another plaintiff claimed he was photographing protests from his vehicle when police began moving down the street where he was parked, firing tear gas and ordering people to disperse. The plaintiff was allegedly blocked in by a police vehicle and therefore unable to comply. According to the complaint, police seized his camera and pulled the memory chip from it before arresting him. The final two plaintiffs claimed they were also arrested for failing to disperse while filming the protests on August 11.\n\nOn October 2, 2014, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding four more plaintiffs to the suit. The City of Ferguson and its police chief and officer (the \"Ferguson defendants\") filed a motion to dismiss on October 24, 2014, and St. Louis County and its chief of police (the \"St. Louis defendants\") filed motions to dismiss party plaintiffs on November 26, 2014. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 1, 2014.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the court (Judge Henry Edward Autrey) dismissed the plaintiffs' claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision against the St. Louis County defendants, and dismissed one of the plaintiffs' claims for assault and battery. The court denied the Ferguson defendants' motion to dismiss. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on May 27, 2015. This amended complaint included claims of six sets of plaintiffs. The Ferguson defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision in the third amended complaint, and the court granted the motion to dismiss on June 25, 2015, using the same rationale under which those claims were dismissed as against the County defendants from the second amended complaint.\n\nThe case was referred to alternative dispute resolution on August 28, 2015, and after a conference on December 1, 2015, the neutral mediator reported that the parties participated in good faith but did not reach a settlement. The parties continued discovery and began to prepare for a trial scheduled in September 2016.\n\nThe Ferguson defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on April 7, 2016, and shortly after, the St. Louis defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. Judge Autrey granted the defendants' motions for summary judgment on September 30, 2016. \nThe court found that the individual police defendants were entitled to official and qualified immunity from suit, and as the plaintiffs failed to establish that qualified immunity did not apply, the supervisory defendants and St. Louis County were also entitled to summary judgment. 2016 WL 8674192. A judgment in the case was entered in favor of the defendants.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Meanwhile in the district court, the parties engaged in some litigation regarding costs, which Judge Autrey awarded to the defendants on June 28, 2017.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit (Judges Diana E. Murphy, James B. Loken, and Michael J. Melloy) issued its opinion on August 1, 2017. 865 F.3d 1064. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment as to the claims of five of the six sets of plaintiffs. The Eight Circuit did reverse in part the district court's grant of summary judgment as to the excessive force claims of one plaintiff. The circuit court found that the district court erred in granting four individual police defendants qualified immunity with regard to the plaintiff's claims that officers had held his head underwater for three to five seconds, pepper sprayed him, and took turns punching and kicking him for two to three minutes. Though the district court had dismissed the excessive force claim after finding that medical evidence undermined the plaintiff's testimony as to these events, the circuit court found this a mischaracterization of the record and said it was a factual dispute to be resolved by a jury. The Eighth Circuit therefore reversed the grant of summary judgment on that plaintiff's § 1983 excessive force claim, as well as the grant of summary judgment on his § 1983 failure to train, supervise, and discipline claim against the St. Louis defendants as it relates to the remaining excessive force claim. The Eighth Circuit responded to a motion for clarification in an August 9, 2017 order, clarifying that the court affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Ferguson defendants on all claims. \n\nThe case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings related to the remaining plaintiff's excessive force claims against four individual County of St. Louis police officers and the corresponding supervisory claims against the County of St. Louis. The plaintiffs filed petitions with the Eighth Circuit for rehearing en banc and rehearing by the panel; the Eighth Circuit denied the petitions for rehearing on September 11, 2017. \n\nIn the district court, Judge Autrey scheduled the action for a jury trial on October 29, 2018; it was later rescheduled for February 4, 2019. Before trial started, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on September 4, 2018 alleging that there were no facts in dispute before trial. Judge Autrey disagreed with this assessment, saying that a jury would decide if the police department's actions amounted to a failure to supervise on January 31, 2019.\n\nThe jury trial took place on its scheduled date. The jurors issued a verdict in favor of the defendants on February 8, 2019.\n\nThe three-month period to file an appeal on the verdict has lapsed, and the case is closed.", "summary": "Several Missouri residents sued the City of Ferguson, Missouri, for acts allegedly perpetrated by Ferguson police officers in the wake of the civil unrest that followed the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown.

The plaintiffs included Black and Latino New York City Housing Authority tenants and their guests who were arrested while visiting.  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the Legal Aid Society, and the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory damages and attorney's fees and costs.  \n\nThe plaintiffs brought their claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000(d); the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.; the United States Housing Act, 42, U.S.C. § 1437, et seq.; the Constitution and laws of the state of New York; and the New York City Human Rights Law. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the City of New York and the New York City Housing Authority (\"NYCHA\"), through the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\"), maintained an unlawful patrol and trespass arrest policy that resulted in a pattern and practice of illegal stops, seizures, questioning, searches, and false arrests of residents of, and authorized visitors to, NYCHA residences.  The NYPD conducted vertical patrols, which are top-to-bottom walk-through patrols or \"sweeps\" of hallways, stairwells, rooftops and landings, elevators, and other common areas of a NYCHA residence.  The complaint alleged that the police stopped and questioned  residents and their visitors without objective individualized suspicion of crime and unlawfully arrested them for trespass without probable cause.  The plaintiffs further alleged that the trespass laws were being enforced in and around NYCHA residences on the basis of race, ethnicity, and/or national origin in an intentionally discriminatory manner, because the patrols focused on NYCHA residences, who were predominantly African American and Latino.  \n\nAccording to the complaint, at least one resident of the building was arrested for \"trespass\" (although charges against him were never prosecuted).  Numerous plaintiffs who were arrested for trespass while visiting building residents suffered negative employment effects due to their arrest and detention, including missed job interviews, suspension or limitation of employment, or full termination. \n\nNine of the original eighteen plaintiffs accepted offers for settlement. (Four accepted on October 4, 2010 and five accepted on December 20, 2010). \n\nOn May 4, 2011, the Court (Judge Shira A. Scheindlin) issued an order compelling the city to provide documents for discovery. The Court ordered the City to produce documents characterized as \"drafts of the training curriculum/training scenarios\" and as \"deliberations about substantiated CCRB complaints concerning the legality of stops and arrests on NYCHA properties,\" and to submit a more detailed privilege log with respect to other documents.\n\nOn July 5, 2011, the Judge Scheindlin denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment.  812 F. Supp. 2d 333. On October 17, 2011, Judge Scheindlin awarded attorneys' fees and costs to those plaintiffs who had accepted settlement offers. \n\nDiscovery battles ensued, and, in several opinions, Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman further compelled production of documents and Judge Scheindlin compelled the appearance of an Integrity Control Officer for deposition.\n\nOn October 4, 2012, Judge Scheindlin granted in part and denied in part defendants' motions for summary judgment. This opinion adjudicated only the individual circumstances of plaintiffs' arrests and tenancies; it did not adjudicate defendants' practices and policies. The Court did not rule definitively on the Equal Protection claims against the City, the Title VI claims, the Fair Housing Act claims, the state and city law claims against NYCHA, nor the United States Housing Act claim against NYCHA because those issues required further briefing. The Court granted summary judgment in favor of NYCHA regarding the equal protection claims (because plaintiffs did not show that NYCHA was liable for the arrests), to the City on state and city human rights law violations, and to defendants on the substantive due process claims (because the Court found them duplicative).  The court denied summary judgment on § 1981 claims regarding two plaintiffs and denied summary judgment on plaintiff's request for injunctive relief.  \n\nOn March 28, 2013, Judge Scheindlin granted in part and denied in part defendants' motions for summary judgement. This opinion granted NYCHA's motion for summary judgement on all remaining NYSC claims as well as granting summary judgement on the remaining race discrimination claims. The Court denied summary judgment on section 1981, FHA, Fourth Amendment, Equal Protection, and USHA claims. 959 F.Supp.2d 324.\n\nOn August 29, 2013, Judge Scheindlin certified the \"Stopped Class\" and \"Resident Class\" under Rule 23(b)(2). 2013 WL 4712501. The parties entered into settlement talks. After two years, the parties finally reached a settlement agreement in January 2015. The NYPD agreed to revise their Patrol Guide on vertical (or interior) patrols in NYC public housing and the related NYPD training materials regarding vertical patrols and enforcement of NYCHA rules. The settlement also imposed a documentation requirement for all trespass arrests in NYC public housing, and modified certain NYCHA rules concerning residents’ cooperation with police and the prohibited activity of “lingering.”  \n\nUpon final court approval, the Davis case would become part of the court monitoring process that was ordered in the lawsuit that successfully challenged the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk policies (<i>Floyd v. City of New York</i>). This settlement would be overseen by the monitor as the one in <i>Floyd</i> and <i>Ligon</i>. \n\nOn April 28, 2015, the court approved the settlement and retained jurisdiction of the case to enforce the settlement. On this day, the case was also transferred to Judge Torres, who was in charge of the other stop-and-frisk cases. see Floyd v.

In their complaint, the plaintiffs cited a statistical analysis prepared by The Legal Aid Society showing that the police executed the the majority of arrests in predominantly Black and Latinx precincts, despite those precincts accounting for less than half of the social distancing complaints. Judge Torres denied the emergency motion on July 8. 2020 WL 3819566. She found that the COVID claims alleged by the plaintiffs did not \"fall squarely within the scope of the policies and practices adjudicated in this litigation.\" Further, Judge Torres noted that the plaintiffs' requested blanket injunction would interfere with lawful police enforcement. \n\nThis case is ongoing.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for a jury trial and sought monetary damages.\n\nOn November 25, 2006, Sean Bell departed a strip club in Queens with two friends at 4:00AM. The three men climbed into a car and Bell proceeded to drive.  The car allegedly struck a police detective in the leg and hit a police van before five officers began to shoot at the car, firing over 50 bullets.  The shooting resulted in the death of Sean Bell, as well as serious personal injuries to the two passengers. \n\nBell's fiancé, as the adminstratrix of his estate, accused the police of wrongful death, assault, negligence and various civil rights violations.  Specifically, she claimed that the police shot Bell without probable cause, that the shooting was performed negligently and recklessly, and that it was performed without reason or provocation.  The NYPD's failure to adequately train these officers, combined with the officers' failure to observe existing police protocol, deprived the decedent of his Fourteenth Amendment privileges, namely: his right to due process of law, his right to liberty, his right to be free from excessive force, and most importantly, his right to life. \n\nWith him in the car were two of Bell's friends, who survived the shooting and were placed under arrest. These plaintiffs sustained severe physical injuries as a result of the shooting, and alleged that the officers lacked probable cause to discharge their weapons and similarly lacked probable cause to place them under arrest.  Claiming that the shooting was performed negligently and recklessly, and without reason or provocation, the plaintiffs stated that the officers deprived them of their Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process, liberty, and the right to be free from physical injury and unwarranted use of force.  The plaintiffs also asserted that they were subjected to false arrest and imprisonment.  All plaintiffs in the suit sought compensatory, exemplary, and punitive damages. \n\nAfter negotiations, the plaintiffs and defendants reached a settlement agreement.  The parties agreed to dismiss the action against the defendants, with prejudice, but without costs, expenses, or attorneys' fees to exceed: $3.25 million to the administratrix of Bell's estate, and $3 million and $900,000 respectively to Bell's two friends that were injured in the shooting.  The plaintiffs additionally agreed to release the defendants from any and all liability or claims that could have been alleged in this particular action.  On October 6, 2010, Judge Roanne L. Mann entered a stipulation of the settlement and order of dismissal.  \n", "summary": "Plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C sections 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988 against the City of New York and the New York City Police Department, for wrongful death, assault, and various civil rights violations. The lawsuit arose from the shooting of Sean Bell, a 23 year-old black man who departed a strip club with two friends late one evening.  Upon getting into a car, a group of five police officers opened fire on the three men, killing Bell and severely injuring the other passengers.

{"document": "On behalf of the residents of New York, New York Attorney General Letitia James brought this lawsuit against the New York City Police Department on January 14, 2021 in the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that NYPD officers regularly used excessive force against and falsely arrested peaceful protesters exercising their First Amendment rights during the widespread racial justice protests that took place from May 28, 2020 to December 11, 2020. The plaintiff sued all defendants under 42 U.S.C § 1983 alleging excessive force and unlawful seizure in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as First Amendment violations. The Attorney General also brought claims under the New York State Constitution alleging excessive force, unlawful seizure, and violation of the freedom of the press. In addition, the complaint alleges that NYPD officers committed assault, battery, false arrest and imprisonment, and negligence under state law and that the NYPD failed to use reasonable care in the training, supervision, and retention of NYPD officers.\n\nPlaintiff alleged that the NYPD dispatched thousands of inadequately trained officers to the large-scale protests challenging police conduct and authority. It further alleged that those officers employed unconstitutional policing practices, including ramming protesters with police bicycles; striking protesters with batons and fists; indiscriminately pepper spraying protesters; shoving protesters to the ground and using chokeholds or kneeling on protesters; “kettling” protesters in order to deny them an opportunity to disperse and thereafter executing mass arrests; and arresting curfew-exempt essential workers, including legal observers, medics, and jail support providers. Additionally, plaintiff alleged that New York City failed to prevent or correct the NYPD’s use of unconstitutional policing practices during the protests.\n\nPlaintiff sought declaratory relief as well as injunctive relief enjoining the NYPD from implementing or applying its unconstitutional policies or practices of employing excessive force, false arrests, and retaliatory tactics against New York residents who participated in the 2020 racial justice protests. Plaintiff also sought an order required the NYPD to change its policies and training procedures and monitoring to ensure its compliance.

{"document": "In 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice opened an investigation into policing practices in Warren, Ohio. In March of 2006, the DOJ issued a findings letter advising the Warren Police Department (WPD) to revise and update its policies and procedures to be consistent and comprehensive. The DOJ found that many officers did not follow WPD's policies, and among other things suggested that WPD revise its policies governing use of force and retrain its officers on its body-cavity and strip search policies. \n\nOn January 13, 2012, the Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against the City of Warren, Ohio, and its police department.  The United States, represented by the Department of Justice, brought the action under 42 U.S.C. § 14141 and asked the court for a declaratory judgment that Warren Police Department's (\"WPD\") policing practices--especially the use of excessive force--infringed on individuals' constitutionally-protected rights. The United States also requested an order that the WPD cease such practices by implementing policies to remedy their transgressive effect.  \n\nAccording to the complaint, the WPD's failure to implement adequate policies to guide, train, supervise, and monitor its officers resulted in a pattern of conduct involving the use of excessive force. The complaint also included allegations that the WPD's policy governing the intake and investigation of complaints was inadequate and, furthermore, that it had failed to adequately review incidents involving the use of force and discipline officers who engaged in misconduct.\n\nThe parties quickly reached a settlement, which the Court (Judge Benita Y. Pearson) approved January 26, 2012. The agreement required the WPD to adopt new protocols involving the use a force, develop procedures to document and evaluate uses of force, institute systems for tracking and investigating citizens' complaints, and implement training encompassing constitutional policing. In addition, the DOJ reserved the right to monitor the WPD's compliance with the agreement, and the Court retained jurisdiction for at least two years to ensure compliance. \n\nOn July 3, 2019, the U.S. filed a motion stating that WPD had \"faithfully and fully\" complied with the requirements of the settlement agreement. The parties filed a joint motion to terminate the settlement agreement. Judge Pearson granted the motion on August 12, 2019.

{"document": "This class action lawsuit was filed on June 28, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. The case was brought by members of the media and legal observers against the City of Portland and sixty unnamed Portland Police Bureau (PPB) officers  amidst the protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd. Plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU Foundation of Oregon. The complaint alleged that PPB had a pattern of targeting and retaliating against journalists and neutral observers. The complaint alleged that defendants' actions were violations of the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well provisions of the Oregon state constitution that protect free speech and free assembly. They sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, including punitive damages. They also sought attorney's fees and costs. \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Anna J. Brown, but then reassigned to Judge Michael H. Simon shortly thereafter. \n\nPlaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the last day of June, and the court granted it in part a few days later. The TRO ordered that neither PPB nor anyone operating with the PPB would be allowed to arrest a media reporter unless they had suspicion that the individual had committed a crime. It also made clear that orders to disperse were not to apply to reporters and observers, but that reporters and observers were to wear signs that signaled they were part of the protected class. Furthermore, police were not to seize equipment or press passes from reporters or legal observers. The order lasted two weeks.\n\nOn July 10, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint, which asserted the same allegations, but adding several plaintiffs (including Index Newspapers). Nearly a week later, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to submit a second amended complaint, this time adding as defendants the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Marshal Services (USMS). Again, the claims for relief did not change. \n\nAdditionally, the plaintiffs and defendant City of Portland stipulated to a preliminary injunction that had the same terms as the TRO, set to expire on October 30. They also filed a motion for a TRO against the DHS and USMS with more or less the same arguments and requests that were made against the PPB in their TRO. The federal defendants submitted a memo a few days later arguing against the TRO, claiming that the plaintiffs did not have standing, were unlikely to succeed on the merits, could not demonstrate irreparable harm, and that the balance of equities did not weigh in the plaintiffs' favor. To make things even more interesting, the City of Portland also filed a memo in support of the TRO against the federal officers, an indication of the City's exasperation with the federal presence. Finally, on July 22, the plaintiffs filed a rebuttal to the DHS's and USMS's memo in opposition to the TRO. \n\nThe next day, Judge Simon granted the TRO against the federal defendants, with the same provisions as the TRO against the PPB. 2020 WL 4220820. Then, on July 28, the plaintiffs submitted a motion asking the court to find the DHS and U.S. Marshals in contempt of court and to issue sanctions over alleged violations of the terms of the TRO. According to the motion (and <a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/federal-agents-shoot-portland-reporter-hours-after-judge-issues-restraining-order-to-protect-journalists-during-protests/\">several media reports</a>), federal agents shot at journalists mere hours after the TRO was issued. Meanwhile, the federal defendants filed a motion asking the court to reconsider the TRO.\n\nOn August 10, the plaintiffs submitted a motion for a preliminary injunction. The motion was partially redacted to the public, in accordance with a stipulated protective order signed earlier that week. The motion for a preliminary injunction had more or less the same arguments as the motion for the TRO, granted a few weeks prior. On August 20, Judge Simon granted plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2020 WL 4883017. In granting the order, Judge Simon made clear that the order did not give journalists or legal observers special privileges to not comply with otherwise lawful orders. The federal defendants did not claim that they had the right to declare a riot; that right was left to the PPB. However, the plaintiffs and the city had already stipulated that the PPB would not arrest any journalist or legal observer for failing to disperse. So the question was whether the federal defendants had the authority to arrest journalists and legal observers outside of federal property. Judge Simon found that they did not, and so the federal agents were in violation of the law when they arrested journalists and legal observers in areas far from the federal property.\n\nThe federal defendants appealed this decision to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on August 21 and submitted a motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal on August 24. The motion to stay was denied by Judge Simon on August 25, but the 9th Circuit entered an administrative stay pending resolution of the emergency motion on August 28, finding that the defendant-appellants had a high likelihood of success on the merits and that not granting the stay would cause irreparable harm.\n\nMeanwhile, on September 4, the City of Portland and the plaintiffs filed an amendment to the stipulated preliminary injunction. The amendment added language saying that \"No Journalist or Legal Observer protected under this Order may impede, block, or physically prevent the lawful activities of the Police.\" The stipulation was signed that day by Judge Simon.\n\nOn September 21, the federal defendants submitted a motion to dismiss, arguing that the case against them should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. They also requested that the court stay discovery requests until the motion was decided. \n\nTwo days later, the plaintiffs and defendant City of Portland submitted an amended stipulated preliminary injunction, which simply extended the time in which the injunction was in effect until the Court reached a decision on the merits. \n\nOn October 9, the 9th Circuit denied the defendant-appellants' emergency motion for a stay pending appeal and lifted the administrative stay entered earlier in August. 977 F.3d 817. The 9th Circuit issued a 76 page opinion finding that the federal defendants did not show a strong likelihood of success on the merits of the appeal. In addition, the federal defendants failed to show that they are likely to suffer irreparable injury if the preliminary injunction was not stayed pending appeal.\n\nBack in the district court, the parties continued briefing on the federal defendants' motion to dismiss. In early December, the plaintiffs and defendant City of Portland entered another stipulation in lieu of contempt motion. The plaintiffs alleged that the City of Portland violated the preliminary injunction by arresting, threatening, and assaulting observers and journalists, as well as preventing observers and journalists from filming protesting activities. The City agreed to investigate the allegations and remove certain officers from public-order policing duty.\n\nThe case is ongoing as of December 31, 2020.", "summary": "This class-action lawsuit was filed on June 28, 2020 in response to Portland Police Bureau's allegedly illegal tactics in quelling the protests in that city after the police killing of George Floyd in May of 2020.

They sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief. \r\n\r\nThe court granted a TRO against the city, prohibiting the police from arresting or seizing the equipment of reporters or legal observers of the protests. The court later granted a preliminary injunction against the city.  \r\n\r\nBy July 16, President Trump had sent in federal officers from the DHS and USMS as reinforcement. The plaintiffs added those two organizations as defendants and filed a motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction. \r\n\r\nThe motion for temporary restraining order and the motion for preliminary injunction were both granted. These decisions were appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has yet to rule on them. However, on October 9, the Ninth Circut declined to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal.

Plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law alleging denial of due process and equal protection, unreasonable search and seizure, invasion of privacy, racial profiling and race/national origin intimidation.\n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs, Hispanic members of the Central Falls High School boys soccer team, claimed that they were treated improperly when traveling to Coventry, a predominately white neighborhood, for a high school soccer game. When the game was over, members of the home team stopped the Central Falls coach and accused his team of stealing electronic devices from the locker room. The coach searched his players' bags but found nothing. The police arrived on the scene, blocking the team's bus, and asked the coach if they could search the players. The coach consented. The police searched the boys' property as members of the Coventry community looked on and shouted racist epithets and accused the boys of theft. The search lasted approximately one hour and none of the allegedly stolen items were found.\n\nOn September 9, 2009, the district court (Judge William Smith) granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court held that the plaintiffs could not overcome qualified immunity in their claims. On the Fourth Amendment claim, the court found plaintiffs' case to be insufficient to overcome qualified immunity because the police officers did not violate the plaintiffs' clearly established rights, because the coach may have been acting in loco parentis when he consented to the police officers' request to search members of the team and their belongings. The court also held that the plaintiffs' invasion of privacy claim arose out of conduct for which the police officers were immune from suit. On the Equal Protection claim, the court held that the plaintiffs failed to show that the officers had a racial motive, even if they exhibited poor judgment in searching the boys in front of an angry crowd; for the same reasons, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the plaintiffs' state racial profiling claim. Finally, the court held there was insufficient evidence for plaintiffs' claim of supervisory and municipal liability.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed to the First Circuit. On April 1, 2011, the Circuit Court (Chief Judge Lynch, Judge Selya, and Judge Thompson) upheld the district court's grant of summary judgment. The appellate court found that the officers' conduct was subject to qualified immunity.

{"document": "In March 2004, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated an investigation of the Virgin Islands Police Department (VIPD) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141. On October 5, 2005, the DOJ issued a technical assistance letter to the department which made recommendations regarding specific changes to the department's policies in the following areas: use of force, vehicle pursuits, holding cells, misconduct investigations, discipline, supervisory oversight, and training.\n\nOn December 23, 2008, the DOJ filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of the Virgin Islands under 42 U.S.C. § 14141 against the VIPD. The DOJ sought both injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that the Virgin Islands government, though its actions and omissions, was engaging in a pattern or practice of subjecting individuals to the use of excessive force. Simultaneously, the parties submitted a proposed consent decree to settle the case. \n\nU.S. District Judge Curtis V. Gomez approved the consent decree on March, 24, 2009. The Decree detailed specific actions to be taken by VIPD regarding evaluation, documentation, and review of use of force incidents; citizen complaint procedures; management and supervision; and training.\n\nOn June 29, 2010, Judge Gomez allowed an amendment to the Consent Decree to make slight modifications to the monitoring timetable. On December 9, 2010, the Office of the Independent Monitor, from the firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, LLP, began filing regular progress/compliance reports.\n\nDue to VIPD's slow progress toward achieving compliance, on November 2, 2012, Judge Gomez adopted a jointly-proposed Action Plan, which aimed to set realistic and achievable compliance deadlines, and incorporated its deadlines into the Consent Decree. Judge Gomez also eliminated the bright-line deadline in the original Consent Decree, and amended it to provide that the Consent Decree would only expire after the VIPD had maintained substantial compliance with its terms for a period of two years. The Action Plan included particular scheduling details for when VIPD officers would receive trainings for vehicle-pursuit and spike-strip policies as well as deadlines for training its internal risk assessment team related to use of excessive force.\n\nAfter the VIPD requested and received multiple extensions on compliance related to specific training objectives, the parties filed a joint motion to amend the Action Plan and Consent Decrees on October 1, 2013. In their proposed amendment to the Action Plan, the parties recognized that VIPD required additional time in order to build the infrastructure in training, policies, and supervisory personnel requisite to achieve compliance. However, before Judge Gomez could rule on the motion, the VIPD failed to meet the deadlines it had outlined in the proposed amendment. As such, the parties supplemented their motion to amend, and on February 25, 2014, Judge Gomez held a hearing on the proposed amendment.\n\nAt the hearing, Judge Gomez noted that the VIPD leadership had continually promised to meet new deadlines and yet had failed to do so. Judge Gomez suggested that the parties instead target meaningful and achievable quarterly goals, with quarterly hearings on the compliance status of each of these goals. On March 7, 2014, the VIPD filed a notice of their proposed quarterly goals. On April 30, 2014, Judge Gomez issued an order adopting these goals, and struck the Action Plan from the Consent Decree, instead adopting a provision for quarterly goals and compliance hearings. The order was amended on May 22 to make minor adjustments to this provision.\n\nOn July 10, 2015, the parties filed a joint motion to amend the Consent Decree with respect to the timing of the Independent Monitor's reports.

{"document": "On May 28, 2014, approximately 125 police officers from the Seattle Police Department (SPD) brought this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The case was assigned to Judge Marsha J. Pechman. The plaintiffs each individually sued the U.S. Department of Justice and the City of Seattle, including the SPD and the Seattle Police Monitor Team, under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for their roles in implementing Seattle’s new use of force policy (UF policy). The new UF policy limited police officers’ ability to use force against civilians without repercussions, and the plaintiffs argued that this policy violated their constitutional rights under the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, they alleged that the policy violated their constitutional right to self-defense, as well as Due Process and Equal Protection. Initially representing themselves pro se, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nOn August 21, 2014, the City of Seattle moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. It alleged that the plaintiffs had misunderstood both what their constitutional rights were and what the new UF policy did, as the officers’ claims were not supported by the U.S. Constitution or by case law. On the same day, the Seattle Police Monitor Team filed a motion to dismiss the case because the members of the monitor team had quasi-judicial immunity. The monitors were appointed by the court as part of a consent decree from an earlier settlement in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12295\"><i>United States v. City of Seattle</i></a> regarding the SPD’s excessive use of force. So, the monitors argued, they could not be considered part of the city the way that the SPD could. \n\nSix days after the motions were filed, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added new factual allegations about the policy and removed those plaintiffs that no longer wished to litigate. The amended complaint emphasized the idea of constitutional self-defense as a right embedded in several amendments rather than stated outright. In September 2014, the defendants filed two motions to dismiss offering arguments similar to those found in the motions to dismiss the original complaint. On October 9, the court held oral arguments on the issue. The plaintiffs also obtained private counsel during this month. \n\nOn October 17, 2014, the court granted both motions to dismiss. Because the complaint had already been amended once and amending it further would be “futile,” Judge Pechman dismissed the case with prejudice. 62 F.Supp.3d 1215. The court held that the monitor team had quasi-judicial immunity and, even without it, the plaintiffs’ claims betrayed their misunderstanding regarding what their constitutional rights were, and the constitutional right to self-defense did not exist; the plaintiffs had failed to allege that any of the defendants had violated their rights.\n\nOn November 14, 2014, the plaintiffs appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision nearly three years later, on September 19, 2017, finding that neither the case law nor the constitution entitled the plaintiffs to self-defense. 871 F.3d 873.\n\nOn December 28, 2017, the plaintiffs petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear this case.

{"document": "On May 22, 2020, a Nevada church filed this lawsuit against the Governor of Nevada, challenging the state’s restrictions on congregational worship during the COVID-19 pandemic. Represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, the church filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. The case was assigned to Judge Larry R. Hicks; when he recused himself, the case was reassigned to Chief Judge Miranda M. Du, and later, based on relatedness to <i>Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain v. Sisolak</i>, to Judge Richard F. Boulware, II.\n\nIn its complaint, the church alleged that the governor’s ban on gathering was unconstitutional. The governor had prohibited public gatherings of 10 or more people, including worship gatherings. However, numerous types of businesses were exempt, and allowed to operate at 50% capacity: restaurants, nail salons, barbershops, and others. When the church filed an amended complaint on May 28, 2020, the governor’s order had been amended: up to 50 people could gather to worship, but the list of businesses allowed to operate at 50% capacity had grown to include gyms, bars, swimming pools, museums, casinos, malls, and bowling alleys. For many of these businesses (particularly casinos), 50% capacity meant groups of several hundred. The church questioned the logic of allowing gatherings of hundreds at casinos in Las Vegas while restricting worship, under threat of criminal and civil penalties, in remote and rural Lyon County. (The Sheriff of Lyon County, also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, supported the church’s position of opposition to the governor’s statewide orders.)\n\nAdditionally, state officials had declined to enforce the gathering ban on large groups of police violence protestors; the governor had publicly supported and encouraged such protests. The church alleged that the facial non-neutrality of the orders, and the state’s inconsistent enforcement of those orders, amounted to a violation of the church’s First Amendment rights of assembly, speech, and free exercise. It sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nOn May 28, 2020, after unsuccessful attempts to persuade the governor to amend his orders, the church filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to be allowed to gather on Sunday, May 31 for Pentecost Sunday. The court (Chief Judge Miranda M. Du) denied the motion the following day, concluding that it was unreasonable for the church to submit an emergency motion one business day before its desired meeting on Pentecost. The court also denied the church’s emergency motion for reconsideration. Two weeks later, on June 11, 2020, the court (now Judge Richard F. Boulware, II) denied the church’s motions for temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, finding that the church had not succeeded in demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits. 2020 WL 4260438.\n\nThe church appealed to the Ninth Circuit on June 15, 2020, seeking an injunction pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied this motion on July 2. 2020 WL 4274901. The church then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, seeking an injunction while the appeal proceeded in the Ninth Circuit. The Supreme Court denied the request on July 24, 2020, over three dissents by four members of the court. 140 S. Ct. 2603.

{"document": "This case addressed First Amendment claims concerning President Donald J. Trump’s blocking of Twitter users from his account.\n\nOn July 11, 2017, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, as well as various political writers and professors, filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued President Donald J. Trump, White House Press Secretary Sean M. Spicer, and other agents of the executive branch alleging First Amendment violations. The plaintiffs argued that President Trump’s Twitter account was a public forum and alleged that by blocking Twitter users who had criticized President Trump or his policies, the defendants had unconstitutionally limited those users’ right to free speech. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the ACLU, sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald. \n\nOn October 13, 2017, the defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims, that the plaintiffs could not establish a state action, and that blocking the individual plaintiffs did not violate the public forum doctrine.\n\t\nOn November 3, 2017, the plaintiffs responded with a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account was a designated public forum and that blocking the individual plaintiffs was an unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.\n\nOn May 23, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied in part both motions for summary judgment. Judge Buchwald concluded that the court had jurisdiction but found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Hope Hicks, two other press officials in the Trump Administration. Thus, the two were dismissed as defendants. Next, the Court found that the type of speech the plaintiffs sought to engage in was protected by the First Amendment and that the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account was susceptible to analysis under the public forum doctrine. Lastly, Judge Buchwald concluded that the viewpoint-based exclusion, or blocking, of a Twitter user from the account was proscribed by the First Amendment and could not be justified by the President’s personal interests. 302 F. Supp. 3d 541.\n\nOn June 4, 2018, the defendants appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. A panel consisting of Judges Barrington D. Parker, Peter W. Hall, and Christopher F. Droney upheld the district court's ruling in a July 9, 2019 decision. They found that the President's Twitter account was not a private platform and produced government speech as part of a public forum. Under this classification, discrimination based on viewpoint was not permissible, and blocking the Twitter users amounted to viewpoint discrimination. The panel added that \"workarounds\" such as logging out of Twitter to see the President's tweets without the ability to comment placed an unfair burden on expression, too. Therefore, the President was no longer allowed to block Twitter users from the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account. 928 F.3d 226.\n\nThe defendants applied for a rehearing en banc after this opinion was filed, but Judge Parker denied their motion on March 23, 2020, reiterating the positions held in the previous opinion. Circuit Judges Michael Park and Richard Sullivan dissented, questioning the broadening of the scope of public forum doctrine to include Twitter accounts. They also contested the decision that a government official using Twitter amounted to government speech. 953 F.3d 216.\n\nTrump petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2020. However, after President Biden's inauguration (Jan. 2020), President Biden was substituted as petitioner. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. The Second Circuit’s judgment from July 9, 2019, (928 F.3d 226) was vacated and the case was remanded to the Second Circuit with instructions to dismiss the case as moot.

Additionally, Thomas wrote that the “more glaring concern must perforce be the dominant digital platforms themselves” and their influence over speech. 141 S.Ct. 1220.\n\nOn June 9, 2021, plaintiffs moved for attorney fees. Plaintiffs argued that they were entitled under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) as they had secured a ruling that “materially altered the legal relationship of the parties and also achieved the benefit Plaintiffs sought.” This was referencing the District Court’s ruling on May 23, 2018. Notably, plaintiffs sought only a portion of the fees that they claimed the EAJA entitled them to. Specifically, plaintiffs declined to pursue many of the costs associated with their private counsel. Instead, plaintiffs mainly sought to be compensatedfor their “distinctive knowledge or specialized skill in the areas of the First Amendment and constitutional law,” citing an apparent “limited availability” for qualified experts in that area.

{"document": "This case was brought by former President Donald J. Trump, his children, and other affiliates (“Plaintiffs”) in response to Congressional subpoenas issued to the former President’s banks, Deutsche Bank AG (“Deutsche Bank”) and Capital One Financial Corp. (“Capital One”).   The banks notified him they would be complying with the subpoenas absent court intervention. Trump initiated this suit against the banks in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in his capacity as a private citizen on April 29, 2019.   \n\nThe complaint alleged that the Congressional subpoenas, which were issued by the House Committee on Financial Services (“Financial Services Committee”) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (“Intelligence Committee”), were initiated to harass the President, because they requested tax returns and other personal financial documents.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the subpoenas lacked a legitimate legislative purpose, and therefore exceeded the Committees’ authority under the Constitution.  The complaint also claimed that the subpoenas violated the Right to Financial Privacy Act (“RFPA”), 12 U.S.C. § 3403(a) because they did not comply with RFPA certification procedures.  The Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief quashing the subpoenas, a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction prohibiting the disclosure of documents, and attorneys’ fees.  \n\nIn their motion for a preliminary injunction, the Plaintiffs argued that they would face irreparable harm if the subpoenaed documents were disclosed.  Specifically, they claimed that the disclosure of confidential documents could compromise the President’s reputation, thereby hindering his ability to do his job.  They also claimed that disclosure would set a precedent that undercuts judicial review of the constitutionality of such subpoenas, thereby “immuniz[ing] the subpoena from challenge.”  \n\t\nIn addition to arguing irreparable harm, the Plaintiffs also claimed that the House Committees lacked a legitimate legislative purpose for the subpoenaed documents, noting that the Committees “have never identified a single piece of legislation within their respective jurisdictions that they are considering.”  \n\nOn May 3, 2019, the House Committees filed a motion to intervene to oppose the President’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The Financial Services Committee asserted that the purpose of the request was to conduct investigations into financial policies to ensure sound lending practices and the prevention of loan fraud.  The Intelligence Committee sought to conduct investigations into “efforts by Russia and other foreign entities to influence the U.S. political process during and since the 2016 election.”  Judge Edgardo Ramos granted the House Committees’ motion on May 3.\n\nJudge Ramos denied the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on May 22, 2019.  2019 WL 2204898.

In the interest of preserving the separation of powers, the Court articulated a higher standard that Congress failed to meet when issuing a subpoena to the President.  Writing for the Court, Chief Justice John Roberts explained that courts needed to apply the following standards when examining Congressional subpoenas:<ol><li>Carefully assess whether the asserted legislative purpose warrants the significant step of involving the President and his papers; </li>\n<li>Insist on a subpoena no broader than reasonably necessary to support this objective;</li>\n<li>Be attentive to the nature of the evidence offered by Congress to establish that a subpoena advances a legislative purpose; and</li>\n<li>Carefully assess the burdens imposed on the President by a subpoena.</li></ol>The Supreme Court vacated the Second Circuit’s opinion and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its order. <i>Trump v.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: A group of Orthodox Jewish synagogues brought this lawsuit against the Governor of New York on October 8, 2020, alleging that the governor's restrictions on gatherings in light of surges in COVID-19 cases violated the Free Exercise Clause. After the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, they appealed to the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted the injunction in part to block the enforcement of the executive order's attendance caps pending the outcome of the appeal in the Second Circuit. The case is ongoing. <hr>\n\nOn October 8, 2020, Agudath Israel and affiliated Orthodox Jewish synagogues in New York City filed this lawsuit challenging an executive order issued by Andrew Cuomo, the Governor of the State of New York, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys' costs and fees. Executive Order 202.68 (\"EO 202.68\") placed restrictions on gatherings at synagogues and other houses of worship in light of a surge in rates of COVID-19 infections in hotspots identified by the New York State Department of Health. Plaintiffs are an Orthodox Jewish group, Agudath Israel of America, three synagogues in Brooklyn and Queens, Agudath Israel of Kew Garden Hills, Agudath Israel of Madison, Agudath Israel of Bayswater, and their leaders. Represented by Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP, the plaintiffs sued under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, as well as 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988. \n\nOn March 7, 2020, pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law § 29, Governor Cuomo issued the original Executive Order 202, implementing the State Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan and declaring a statewide disaster emergency as a result of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. Over the next few months, Governor Cuomo issued multiple supplemental Executive Orders, continuing the temporary suspension and modification of certain laws relating to the state of emergency.\n\nIn response to a spike in the rate of positive COVID-19 cases in five \"hotspots\" located in Brooklyn and Queens, Governor Cuomo issued Executive Order 202.68 (\"EO 202.68\") on October 6, 2020, which directed the New York State Department of Health to identify yellow, orange, and red “zones” based on the severity of outbreaks, and impose correspondingly severe restrictions on activity within each zone. EO 202.68 established central “red zones,” where non-essential gatherings were cancelled and schools and nonessential businesses were prohibited from operating in-person. Red zone houses of worship were permitted to remain open with a capacity of 25% maximum occupancy or 10 people, whichever was fewer. Similarly, in orange zones, non-essential gatherings, schools, and certain nonessential businesses were subject to more severe restrictions than houses of worship. Precautionary “yellow zones” were subject to lesser restrictions then red and orange zones. EO 202.68 was temporary and the zones were re-evaluated based on changes in the underlying data. \n\nThe executive order was issued in advance of three special holidays for the Orthodox Jewish community to be held on October 9, 10, and 11, for the purpose of \"tackl[ing] the risk posed by mass gatherings, including those taking place in houses of worship.\" When the complaint was filed, two synagogues were located in red zones and one was in an orange zone. \n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that EO 202.68 violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and sought a declaratory judgment preventing its enforcement. They argued that the executive order was facially discriminatory towards religious practices compared to similar secular activities and that religious institutions were targeted for punitive reasons because of their religious nature. The same day, the plaintiffs also filed an emergency motion for an order to show cause for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The case was assigned to Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto and Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy.\n\nThe court ordered the defendants to show cause by October 9 as to why the requested injunctive relief should not be granted.\n\nAfter the parties submitted briefing and held a hearing, Judge Matsumoto denied the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction because they failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of their First Amendment claim. The court held that EO 202.68 was neutral, generally applicable, and did not burden Plaintiffs’ free exercise rights. Judge Matsumoto noted that the order also shut down nonessential businesses and schools in hotspots as well and found that the new rules were not motivated by an intention to discriminate against Orthodox Jews.\n\nOn October 19, the plaintiffs appealed the denial to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and filed a motion for an injunction. The case was scheduled to be heard in tandem with a related case, The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, Docket No. 20-3590. Their request for a stay in the district court pending appeal was denied. \n\nOn November 9, the Second Circuit denied the plaintiffs' motion for an injunction primarily for procedural reasons because they failed to first request an injunction pending appeal in district court before seeking relief in the Court of Appeals. 979 F.3d 177 (Nov. 9, 2020). But, the order also addressed the similar substantive claims raised in the related case, Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, and held that the order did not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The court noted that the order was not substantially underinclusive as plaintiffs had alleged because \"within each zone, the order subjects religious services to restrictions that are similar to or, indeed, less severe than those imposed on comparable secular gatherings.\" \n\nThe plaintiffs then filed an emergency application for injunctive relief to the Supreme Court on November 16 to prohibit the enforcement of EO 202.68 until the Second Circuit could issue a decision on the merits. Case Number 20A90. The Supreme Court granted the injunction in part on November 25, resting on the reasoning outlined in the related case, <i>Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo</i>, 592 U. S. ____ (Nov. 25, 2020). The Court barred the enforcement of the 10- and 25-person occupancy limits because it found that the executive order was not neutral and that less restrictive rules could have been employed instead. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan dissented. \n\nMeanwhile, back in district court, the defendant notified the court in a letter on November 3 of the party's intent to file a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that it was moot because the holidays it was based on had already passed. \n\nThe case is currently pending appeal in the Second Circuit.", "summary": "A group of Orthodox Jewish synagogues brought this lawsuit against the Governor of New York on October 8, 2020, alleging that the governor's restrictions on gatherings in light of surges in COVID-19 cases violated the Free Exercise Clause.

{"document": "On March 5, 2019, the State of Washington filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for violating Title X’s “Nondirective Mandate,” the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Title X generally, and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706). On March 4, 2019, HHS published a Final Rule, scheduled to go into effect on May 3, 2019, which would alter longstanding regulations governing Title X grants for family planning services. Washington sought declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate the Final Rule and prohibit HHS from implementing or enforcing it, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. \n\nOn March 18, 2019, this case was consolidated for pretrial proceedings with a separate case filed by the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA; a national membership organization of Title X providers that operate or administer more than 3,500 health centers providing family planning services to more than 3.7 million patients each year), and two health care professionals, challenging the same HHS Rule on behalf of themselves and their patients. These plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU and private counsel. The original Washington case and consolidated case were assigned to Judge Stanley A. Bastian.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the Rule would eliminate a Title X requirement that pregnant patients receive nondirective pregnancy counseling (“Nondirective Mandate”); deny Title X funds to entities that provide comprehensive reproductive health care services at the same clinical site (such as abortion services); and impose numerous additional requirements that would undermine the quality of medical care, interfere with provider-patience relationships, reduce access to services, and contravene Title X’s purpose. Washington alleged that the Final Rule would expel providers representing 89% of Washington’s Title X network, require a DOH program contrary to Washington Law, and result in a loss of Title X funds that would irreparably harm Washington and its most vulnerable residents by reducing the effectiveness of Washington’s family planning program and causing financial harm to State Medicaid and related programs. \n\nWashington and the NFPRHA parties filed preliminary injunctions on March 22, 2019, seeking to prohibit HHS from implementing the Final Rule. HHS filed a motion in opposition on April 12, 2019, and a motion hearing was held on April 25, 2019. After the hearing, Judge Bastian granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Final Rule nationwide until further order of the court. 376 F.Supp.3d 1119. The decision noted that, “although Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that all four factors [likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, balance of equities, and public interest] tip in their favor, the irreparable harm and balance of equities factors tip so strongly in Plaintiffs’ favor that a strong showing of likelihood on the merits was not necessary.” \n\nOn May 3, 2019, defendants filed a notice of appeal and motion to stay the preliminary injunction, as well as a notice of interlocutory and preliminary injunction appeal regarding plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction. On May 4, 2019, defendants filed a motion to expedite the hearing on their motion to stay plaintiff’s preliminary injunction, which was denied three days later. \n\nOn May 24, 2019, defendants filed a motion to stay proceedings pending appeal. Defendant’s motion to stay plaintiff’s preliminary injunction pending appeal was denied on June 3, 2019, and defendant’s motion to stay proceedings pending appeal was denied on June 14, 2019.\n\nOn June 20, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a three-judge panel per curiam decision granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit noted that the Final Rule was challenged in federal court in California, Oregon, and Washington (this case), and district courts in each case granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds.

Washington and Fair Park relative to other schools in the district. This order remains ongoing to this day. In 2017, the Caddo Parish School Board decided to merge these two schools and turn Fair Park into a middle school. The decision, according to the Board, would save money and resources. On May 5, 2017, the plaintiffs, parents of students attending Fair Park and a Fair Park alumni association, brought this suit to enjoin the merger and declare the School Board's actions unconstitutional. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause, as well as violations of the 1981 Consent Order and state law. On the same day, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the defendant from merging the schools through the duration of this case.\n\nThree days later, on May 8, the School Board responded in opposition to the TRO. It argued that the claims were unrelated to the 1981 Consent Order and that the conversion of Fair Park was unrelated to race and would aid the students. But on May 16, plaintiffs reported that they no longer intended to move for preliminary relief, and they voluntarily withdrew their motion the next day.

{"document": "On Dec. 3, 1997, an applicant to the University of Michigan Law School brought this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the University of Michigan Law School. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, claimed that, in denying her admission, the school discriminated against her on the basis of her race, and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. She claimed that the school used the race of its applicants not merely as a plus factor in determining admission, but as one of the predominant factors. Moreover, she claimed, the school had no compelling interest to justify their use of race in the admissions process, nor did they ever employ any race-neutral alternatives. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief. On Jan. 7, 1999, the Court (Judge Bernard A. Friedman) certified the class. \n\nIn March 2001, after a bench trial, Judge Friedman ruled for Grutter and determined that the law school's admissions policy was unconstitutional. By using race to ensure the enrollment of a certain minimum percentage of underrepresented minorities, the court held, the law school had \"made the current admissions policy practically indistinguishable from a[n unconstitutional] quota system.\" 137 F. Supp. 2d 821. The district court also concluded that the achievement of racial diversity is not a compelling state interest.\n\nThe law school appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which heard the appeal en banc. On May 14, 2002, the court (Chief Judge Boyce F. Martin, Jr. wrote the majority opinion) reversed the district court. The court held (1) that the Supreme Court had established in <i> Bakke </i> that achieving a diverse student body was a compelling interest, and (2) that the school's policy was narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. 288 F.3d 732. \n\nGrutter petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court, which granted it in December 2002. On June 23, 2003, the Court affirmed the 6th Circuit decision, and held that the law school's desire to obtain a \"critical mass\" of underrepresented minority students counted as a narrowly tailored use of race in its admissions process. Moreover, the Court held, the school's use of race furthered its compelling interest in \"obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.\" Because the law school engaged in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant, giving serious consideration to all the ways the applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment, it ensured that all factors that could contribute to diversity were meaningfully considered alongside race. Its admissions process was not unconstitutional. \n\nThe majority opinion (written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer) did note that affirmative action should not be allowed to exist forever, but, rather, that at some future date (the opinion mentions 25 years hence), only colorblind policies should be allowed. \n\nJustice Thomas issued an opinion concurring only with the majority opinion's implication of a 25-year window of affirmative-action legitimacy. He dissented from the rest of the opinion, stating that the law school had no compelling interest in maintaining an elite, but racially diverse, campus. If the school wanted to achieve greater diversity, he wrote, it could relax its test score and GPA requirements.\n\nOn March 17, 2004, Judge Friedman ordered the case closed.\n", "summary": "On Dec. 3, 1997, Barbara Grutter brought this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the University of Michigan Law School.

The plaintiffs, represented by public interest counsel, claimed that the university's admissions policy treated race as a predominant factor in granting admission, and that they, as white applicants, had been discriminated against in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn Dec. 23, 1998, the court (Judge Patrick J. Duggan) certified the class comprising \"[t]hose individuals who applied for and were not granted admission to the College of Literature, Science & the Arts of the University of Michigan for all academic years from 1995 forward and who are members of those racial or ethnic groups, including Caucasian, that defendants treat less favorably on the basis of race in considering their application for admission.\" \n\nOn Dec. 13, 2000, Judge Duggan granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment with respect to the university's admissions policy during the years 1995-1998---during which time a specific number of admissions were reserved for minority applicants---and declared those policies unconstitutional. But the court also granted defendants' motion for summary judgment with regard to the admissions programs for the years 1999-2000---during which time applicants were graded on a 150-point scale, and underrepresented minorities automatically received 20 points based on their membership to one of the identified minority categories. \n\nJudge Duggan determined that \"the educational benefits flowing from a racially and ethnically diverse student body are a sufficiently compelling interest to survive strict scrutiny,\" and the point system in place at the time of the decision was narrowly tailored to achieve that purpose, though the policies in place from '95-'98 were not. The court denied the plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief, and granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity.\n\nThe Dec. 13, 2000, Order and Opinion limited itself to the question of whether the university's admissions policies passed constitutional muster as narrowly tailored means of achieving diversity. In a Feb. 26, 2001 opinion, Judge Duggan ruled on whether the policies passed constitutional muster as a narrowly tailored means of remedying past and current discrimination by the university. 135 F.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the ACLU of Florida, the ACLU, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that Florida's voter purge procedures violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\"VRA\").  \n\nSpecifically, the state had implemented \"voter registration list maintenance activities\" such as forwarding list of \"potential non-citizens\" to Supervisors of Elections and requiring these Supervisors to remove the names from registration. The plaintiffs claimed that these procedures required Section 5 pre-clearance from the federal government before they could be legally implemented. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. §1973c, is a temporary provision that prohibits changes in election practices or procedures in states and political subdivisions with a documented history of discriminatory voting practices until the new procedures have been determined not to have the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. \n\nOn July 13, 2012, the defendant—Florida’s Secretary of State—filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint. The defendant claimed that the plaintiffs did not have a claim upon which relief could be granted for several reasons: Florida was not a jurisdiction that Section 5 covered, Florida changed it’s voting procedures that would be subject to Section 5 before the plaintiffs filed their suit, the plaintiffs failed to acknowledge any of Florida’s voting procedure changes subject to Section 5 pre-clearance, and the statewide injunction sought by the plaintiffs was inappropriate because the alleged violation existed in only five of Florida’s 67 counties.\n\nThe plaintiff’s filed an amended complaint on July 27, 2012 to update and expand the list of facts underlying their claims.

Section 4(b) contained the formula that determined which jurisdictions would be subject to the pre-clearance requirements listed in Section 5. Back in the District Court for the Middle District of Florida, the defendant filed notice that further litigation in this case was unnecessary. Because the Supreme Court in <i>Shelby County</i> found the process for determining which jurisdictions would be covered by the Section 5 pre-clearance requirements to be unconstitutional, the defendant argued Florida was no longer covered by the Section 5 pre-clearance requirements and therefore the plaintiffs no longer had a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n\nIn light of the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Shelby County,</i> both parties agreed that the plaintiffs' complaint should be dismissed, but they disagreed over whether or not it should be dismissed with prejudice.

The plaintiffs filed the suit after anticipating mail-in votes to skyrocket for the June and November 2020 elections, given that the COVID-19 pandemic posed health risks for in-person voting. The plaintiffs argued that because election officials required voters to pay postage, the state unconstitutionally forced voters to pay in order to participate in the election. They also alleged that the poll tax posed an undue burden on the right to vote in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Specifically, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief injunction requiring election officials to provide prepaid returnable envelopes for absentee ballots and absentee ballot applications.

The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and assigned to Judge Amy Totenberg. \n\nOn April 20, the defendants filed an opposition to the preliminary injunction, claiming that the Secretary had already taken various steps to mitigate the risk of harm to Georgia primary voters during the COVID-19 outbreak.

On May 12, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction, and sought to expedite the briefing process to implement the requested relief in time for the August runoff. The request was denied on May 15, and the court noted that the emergency motion did not raise any new facts or arguments, instead “‘incorporat[ing] by reference all prior filings and evidence submitted in connection with the Original Plaintiffs’ prior motion for preliminary injunction’ and seek[ing] relief for the August runoff and November general elections.”\n\nOn May 18, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, stating that the claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and legislative immunity.

The plaintiff class was subdivided into a subclass of all registered Georgia voters who satisfy one of the COVID-19 risk factors identified by the Center for Disease Control. \n\nOn August 11, the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction was denied as to Count I of the amended complaint, which alleged that the state imposed an unconstitutional poll tax in violation of the Fourteenth and Twenty-Fourth Amendments. 2020 WL 4597053.

The plaintiffs noted that there was no emergency action plan in place for the November and December elections and that even with the plan in place, the narrow category of excuses and the need for a witness forced voters to choose between exercising their right to vote and potentially endangering themselves. Therefore, the plaintiffs alleged that Louisiana’s Excuse Requirement and Witness Requirement imposed undue burdens on the fundamental right to vote, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs also challenged the lack of notice and opportunity to cure defects with mail-in votes. The plaintiffs alleged that the “Cure Prohibition” violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying certain populations the right to due process. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on May 29.\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate case, <i>Power Coalition v. Edwards</i>, its plaintiffs also filed a suit to challenge the Excuse Requirement, Witness Requirement, and the Cure Prohibition. <i>Power Coalition v. Edwards</i> and <i>Clark v. Edwards</i> were consolidated on June 3. \n\nOn June 5, the State of Louisiana filed a motion to intervene as defendants, which was granted on June 8. The same day, they filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they had not adequately alleged state action. The defendants also claimed that because of the proximity of the election, there should not be last-minute electoral meddling. On June 15, the defendants filed a joint motion to amend, which was denied on June 17. The same day, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to remove the Parish Registrars of Voters as defendants. \n\nOn June 22, the court granted the motion to dismiss and all claims against the defendants were dismissed with prejudice. 2020 WL 3415376. The court found that the plaintiffs’ claims did not adequately allege an injury in fact sufficient to give rise to standing, because the demonstrated injury was not traceable to state action. The hearing scheduled for the preliminary injunction was accordingly canceled. On June 25, the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment to dismiss their claims without prejudice, which was granted on June 30. \n", "summary": "This suit was brought on May 19, 2020, by two non-profit organizations and three voter plaintiffs against the state of Louisiana to challenge Louisiana’s Excuse Requirement, Witness Requirement, and Cure Prohibition. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from enforcing the Excuse and Witness Requirement, as well as provide absentee voters with notice and opportunity to cure defects in their absentee ballots for all elections in 2020 held in Louisiana. On June 22, the court dismissed the case."}

On May 12, the South Carolina General Assembly passed legislation allowing all qualified South Carolina voters to vote by absentee ballot for the June primaries. On May 25, the court granted the plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions in part, granting relief as to the witness requirement. On September 18, the Witness Requirement was enjoined for the November 2020 General Election in a separate case, and the district court stayed the case. The defendants sought reconsideration.<hr>\n\nOn April 22, four individuals facing a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19 and the Family Unit, a non-profit organization, filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against the enforcement of South Carolina’s witness requirement and the excuse requirement, which were required in order to vote by an absentee ballot. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (ACLU), the ACLU of South Carolina, and the NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, the plaintiffs brought this action against the South Carolina State Election Commission and the Governor of South Carolina. They sought sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C § 1983 for violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. §§ 10301, 10302(b), and 10501. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that enforcement of South Carolina’s witness signature requirement during the pandemic posed an unconstitutional barrier to voting and that the exclusive category of \"persons qualified to vote by absentee ballot,\" did not include voters fearful of COVID-19 transmission. The plaintiffs alleged that the two requirements threatened to disenfranchise thousands of eligible South Carolina voters and that COVID-19 would have a disproportionate impact on older populations, voters with disabilities, and African-American voters. The plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing the requirements during COVID-19, as well as modification of election materials to reflect the elimination of the requirements before the June 2020 primaries. The case was assigned to Judge Michelle Childs. \n\nOn April 28, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of the two requirements, include self-isolation as an excuse exempting the witness requirement and enter an expedited schedule requiring the defendants to respond within seven days. The motion to enter an expedite the schedule was granted in part, but the specific schedule proposed by the plaintiff was denied. \n\nThe South Carolina Republican Party (SCRP) filed a motion to intervene alleging voter fraud concerns on May 1. On the same day, the Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, an independent non-profit corporation, requested to file an amicus brief. The motion to file an amicus brief was granted on May 6. And, on May 8, SCRP’s motion to intervene was granted. 2020 WL 2306615. \n\nOn May 11, the defendants and the SCRP each submitted a motion opposing the preliminary injunction. \n\nMeanwhile, <a href=\"https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17587\"> another action</a> was filed by individuals and the South Carolina Democratic Party on May 7, challenging the absentee ballot requirement in South Carolina against the same defendants. The Middleton plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction enjoining the witness requirement, election day cutoff, and the absentee ballot age restriction limiting the categorical prohibition of all voters under 65 from casting a mailed absentee ballot.\n\nOn May 12, the South Carolina General Assembly passed legislation allowing all qualified South Carolina voters to vote by absentee ballot for the June 9 primary and the June 23 runoff election. Two days later, the court determined that the injunctive relief sought by both Thomas and Middleton plaintiffs would be limited to the June 2020 primaries, as the defendants did not receive proper notice to prepare arguments regarding elections following the June 2020 primaries. \n\nOn May 15, there was a consolidated hearing to address the pending motions for preliminary injunctions in both the Thomas and Middleton cases, with the remaining issues limited to the June primaries. \n\nOn May 25, the court granted the preliminary injunction motions pertaining to the witness signature requirement, to be applied only for the June 2020 primaries. 2020 WL 2617329. The defendants were also ordered to immediately and publicly inform South Carolina voters of the elimination of the witness requirement. \n\nOn July 13, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP as plaintiff while dropping one plaintiff. In addition, the plaintiffs withdrew the claim alleging that the witness requirement violated Section 201 of the Voting Rights Act, while adding the claim that the requirement discriminates against the plaintiffs in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). On July 24, the SCRP sought to re-intervene for the amended complaint. On August 4, the court noted that they had already allowed SCRP to intervene and that intervention is still in effect. \n\nOn August 10, 3 individual plaintiffs, The Family Unit, and the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP voluntarily dismissed the case. The same day, the defendant and the SCRP both filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that none of the requirements violated the Constitution, the VRA, or the ADA. On August 11, the Attorney General of South Carolina sought to file an amicus brief for the case.\n\nOn August 12, Jay Lucas, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Harvey Peeler, the President of the Senate, sought to intervene, which was granted on August 24. 2020 WL 4934305. The intervening defendants submitted responses in support of both motions for summary judgment, arguing that determining how to conduct South Carolina's elections was a legislative function, not a judicial one, and that the challenged provisions of South Carolina law were lawful. \n\nOn August 14, the parties filed a stipulated motion to dismiss without prejudice as to the defendant Governor of South Carolina. \n\nOn September 15, 2020, the South Carolina General Assembly passed legislation suspending the Excuse Requirement by allowing all qualified voters to vote by absentee ballot for the November 2020 General Election due to the current state of emergency. Three days later the court enjoined the Witness Requirement for all South Carolina voters in the upcoming November 2020 General Election in the Middleton case. In light of the suspension of the challenged provisions for the November 2020 General Election, the district court stayed the case. 2020 WL 5593847. The court instructed that the plaintiffs may request to lift the stay when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or future statewide elections in South Carolina are sufficiently determinable. The defendants sought reconsideration of the stay, arguing that staying the case on grounds that the Middleton injunction resolved the issues to be tried in this case, would effectively grant the Thomas plaintiffs their requested relief \"without having to ever prove anything at all . . . [which is] unjust and an abuse of discretion.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs sought to consolidate the current case with <i>Middleton v. Andino</i>, however, the court denied the motion on September 22, reasoning that a district court did not have jurisdiction to consolidate an action before it with an action pending before an appellate court.\n\nThe case is ongoing.

{"document": " On December 13, 2011, registered voters in Wisconsin filed this lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA). The plaintiffs sued the State of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, and the Division of Motor Vehicles. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest and private counsel, claimed that the voter ID requirement implemented by 2011 Wisconsin Act 23 (Act 23) placed an undue burden on their right to vote, constituted a poll tax, and has a disproportionate impact on minority voters. The plaintiffs claimed that their fundamental right to vote under the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the VRA had been violated. Specifically, they alleged that the voter ID requirement placed a substantial burden on the right to vote, particularly for black and Latino voters, by requiring photo ID that many voters do not have and cannot easily obtain. The plaintiffs sought both declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Lynn S. Adelman. A group of eleven plaintiffs immediately filed for a preliminary injunction, which was revised as a motion for all plaintiffs on April 23, 2012. The plaintiffs moved for class certification on the same day. The court did not rule on these issues. \n\nInstead, the parties engaged in extensive discovery, which culminated in a trial in early November 2013.\n\nIn an April 29, 2014 decision, the district court held that the Voter ID requirement disproportionately and negatively impacted minority voters in violation of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 17 F.Supp.3d 837. Judge Adelman ordered a permanent injunction against enforcement of the voter ID law. The defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (docket number 14-2058). In a decision by Judge Frank H. Easterbrook on October 6, 2014,  the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court on the grounds that the voter ID law did not violate the VRA or the Equal Protection Clause. 768 F.3d 744. The plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, which was denied. 135 S.Ct. 1551.\n\nThe plaintiffs then returned to district court to pursue constitutional claims that were not considered by Judge Adelman in his initial April 29, 2014 decision about this case. The plaintiffs claimed their rights were violated because certain forms of IDs were not accepted, and some voters would have to turn over out-of-state IDs to get an acceptable Wisconsin ID, which plaintiffs argue was essentially a poll tax. In an October 19, 2015 decision, the district court found that concerns about technical college IDs being unacceptable were unripe. 141 F.Supp. 3d 932. Additionally, allegations of a poll tax were found to be moot, and claims about veterans IDs being unacceptable were dismissed on the merits. The district court held that it could not address the request for relief for those voters “who lack photo ID and face systemic practical barriers to obtaining an ID” by issuing an injunction allowing individuals to sign an affidavit instead because this issue was before the court in 2014 and the Seventh Circuit decision reversed without remanding for further proceedings on this claim. 141 F.Supp. 3d 932. Following this decision, the Wisconsin legislature amended Act 23 to include veterans’ ID as acceptable forms of voter identification. \n\nThe plaintiffs appealed on the grounds that the district court did not properly reconsider their core argument: that voters face barriers to obtaining an acceptable ID and therefore are entitled to relief. In a decision made April 12, 2016, the Seventh Circuit confirmed that the district court could consider this argument and remanded for further proceedings. 819 F.3d 384. \n\nOn July 19, 2016, after further proceedings, Judge Adelman granted a preliminary injunction allowing voters without IDs to sign an affidavit in place of the ID requirement for the November 8, 2016 election. In this decision, he also certified the class of plaintiffs in this case, defining the class “as all eligible Wisconsin voters who cannot with reasonable effort obtain qualifying ID.” 196 F. Supp. 3d 893. Shortly after, the parties filed cross appeals to the Seventh Circuit (docket numbers 16-3003 and 16-3052) and the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction. \n\nOn July 29, 2016, the district court denied the defendants’ motion to stay the preliminary injunction. 2016 WL 4059226. However, the Seventh Circuit stayed the injunction pending the cross appeals on August 10, 2016. 2016 WL 4224616. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the order staying the injunction, but the Seventh Circuit denied the motion. The Seventh Circuit found that emergency procedures in place by the state to permit anyone who enters the ID Petition Process (a process through which any applicant must receive a photo ID on request unless the state shows certain grounds disqualified them) to get a receipt that would serve as a valid ID for the November 2016 election meant that further temporary relief was unnecessary at that time. The plaintiffs also filed an emergency motion for rehearing en banc of the order staying the injunction, but the Seventh Circuit denied the petition for hearing en banc for similar reasons. 835 F.3d 649.\n\nThe plaintiffs moved to add a new plaintiff to the case and for a temporary restraining order to ensure that the new plaintiff’s provision ballot would be counted despite not having a valid ID. On November 10, 2016, Judge Adelman granted the plaintiffs’ motion to file a supplemental complaint but denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. 2016 WL 6651323. The supplemental complaint was filed the same day.\n\nOn February 24, 2017, oral argument was held on the cross appeals. As of December 2019, this case was ongoing and the cross appeals remained pending in the Seventh Circuit.", "summary": "In 2011 voters in Wisconsin filed this lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The plaintiffs alleged that their fundamental right to vote had been violated by Act 23, Wisconsin's law implementing a voter ID requirement. After much litigation, in 2016 a judge granted a preliminary injunction allowing voters without IDs to sign an affidavit in place of the ID requirement for the 2016 presidential election. The state appealed the injunction to the Seventh Circuit. The Seventh Circuit stayed the injunction pending the appeal. As of December 2019, the appeal remained pending in the Seventh Circuit."}
{"document": "On June 21, 2016, individuals who had been subject to a $50 \"extension fee\" for inability to pay their monetary penalties in full, under threat that they would otherwise go to jail for non-payment of court fines and costs, brought this putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued the Bogalusa City Court and the sole judge who sits on the Bogalusa City Court for violations of their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They claimed that the defendants: systematically jailed and threatened to jail individuals who cannot pay fines and court costs that were used to fund expenditures of the city court; and have created an illegal extension fee to generate additional revenue. \n\nRepresented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, as well as to certify a class and subclass for equitable relief and a separate class for damages. The class for equitable relief was to be defined as \"all individuals who will appear in the Bogalusa City Court for criminal cases or who have unpaid fines and costs assessed by and opened by the City Court. The Subclass was to be defined as \"all individuals who were or will be adjudicated guilty in the Bogalusa City Court, who have been worn will be given a future date by which to return to City Court, and who have not paid the assessed fines and costs in full prior to returning to City Court.\" The class seeking damages included those individuals who paid an extension fee between June 22, 2015 to the time of the complaint. \n\nIn a June 23, 2016 order, U.S. District Court Judge Ivan L.R. Lemelle denied the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order, and held their request for a preliminary injunction in abeyance. Shortly thereafter, the parties agreed to explore a possible settlement.\n\nAs settlement negotiations were getting under way, the parties reached an interim agreement, which they filed on June 27, 2016. Once approved by the Court, it was to govern the next 75 days. During this time period, the defendant judge agreed not to incarcerate any Bogalusa City Court defendant on the sole basis of nonpayment of fines or costs or contempt fee, nor assess or collect (i) any court cost authorized by La. Stat. Ann. § 13:1899; (ii) any “extension fees” or similar payments required by the City Court to allow a defendant additional time to pay court debt; or (iii) any contempt fees that are retained by the City Court and deposited into the City Court’s judicial expense account.\n\nIn addition, for the same interim time period, the defendant judge agreed to provide to the plaintiffs’ counsel a copy of daily jail logs for the Bogalusa City Jail, and an up-to-date copy of the Bogalusa City Court’s “Criminal Account-Citizens Income Statement.” Both parties agreed to submit a joint written status report in 45 days to report on the status of settlement discussions and the parties’ respective positions on how the Court should proceed with the pending motions for preliminary injunction and class certification. This agreement was repeatedly renewed through motions to continue until the parties reached a full settlement on September 5, 2017.\n\nOn June 28, 2016, Judge Lemelle granted the joint motion and further ordered that the plaintiffs' Motion to Certify Class and their Motion for Preliminary Injunction to be dismissed without prejudice. \n\nOn January 17, 2017, plaintiffs amended their complaint with allegations that defendants, without the authorization of state law and after agreeing to halt the $50 dollar “extension fee,” began assigning community service as a sanction for non-payment, instead of jail-time, and established a $25 “enrollment fee” for individuals to complete community service.\n\nOn June 7, 2017, a partial settlement agreement was reached. The defendants agreed to issue $50 dollar refunds to all parties who paid the “extension fee” on and after June 21, 2015. The plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the fifth claim for relief of their first amended complaint, which sought compensatory damages for the payment of the extension fee, and agreed to dismiss defendant Bogalusa City Court from the suit. \n\nOn June 21, 2017, plaintiff’s motion for class certification was dismissed without prejudice.\n\nOn September 5, 2017, a full settlement was reached. Plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their lawsuit against the defendant. In exchange, the defendant agreed, for a period of thirty months, to stop jailing indigent individuals for failure to pay court debt solely due to their inability to pay the debt, agreed to discontinue use of any extension fees except as explicitly authorized by state law, and agreed to discontinue use of an enrollment fee for community service. The defendant also agreed to implement warrant amnesty days that would enable individuals with arrest warrants for failure to comply with an order to appear, subpoena, or summons to appear at the city court to receive a new hearing date and clear any warrants. \n\nThe defendant also permanently agreed to no longer collect or assess any court costs that would be deposited into an account controlled directly by the city court. Instead, these costs or fees would be deposited into a special account maintained by the City of Bogalusa, who would have control of the account and any disbursements made therefrom. The court was also required to submit a yearly budget request to fund operations of the city court, which the mayor and city council must approve in accordance with the city charter. The City of Bogalusa would maintain discretion to allocate funds from the special account to the court to fund operations of the court.\n\nFinally, the defendant agreed to a six-month reporting period wherein the defendant would notify the plaintiff’s counsel when any city court defendant was being placed in jail for nonpayment of a fine, costs, or failure to complete a form of alternative payment.\n\nThe court maintained jurisdiction over the case.

{"document": "On October 31st, 2016, a group of Plaintiffs who had been jailed for their inability to pay fines owed to the City of Florissant, Missouri for traffic tickets or other minor municipal offenses, sued the City for this violation of due process in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The Plaintiffs are represented by the Advancement Project, ArchCity Defenders, Inc., and private counsel. The Plaintiffs sued the City of Florissant, MO under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violations of the Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The Plaintiffs alleged that the City held individuals in jail in “grotesque, dangerous, inhumane conditions\" until all fines and fees set by the City are paid – usually by friends or relatives. Further, they alleged that the amount paid was arbitrarily and significantly reduced when the City recognizes that they are unable to profit from the plaintiffs' detention. Also, they alleged that the City issued and enforced arrest warrants for the plaintiffs' failure to appear in court or at the jail to pay their fines. They alleged that individuals were held in jail for days in inhumane conditions before they appeared before the judge. The Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment stating that the rights of Plaintiffs were violated by the City, injunctive relief permanently enjoining the City from enforcing these unconstitutional policies and practices, and compensatory relief for damages suffered as a result of the City’s unconstitutional and unlawful conduct, as well as payment of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Nannette A. Baker. Both parties consented to magistrate judge jurisdiction in November 2016. \n\nThis case was first referred to alternative dispute resolution (ADR) on June 1, 2017. The court continued to attempt to force the two parties to resolve this dispute through mediation throughout the rest of 2017 and most of 2018. On November 16, 2018, the parties agreed on a neutral mediator, James W. Reeves. Mediation seemed poised to start in early December 2018, but the order referring the case to ADR was vacated on December 6, 2018. During that same time, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or alternatively to strike or for a more definite statement on January 13, 2017. The court denied this motion on December 12, 2017, with the court holding that the plaintiffs had filed a valid claim with the court.\n\nThroughout 2019, the case proceeded slowly, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings for failure to join an indispensable party on March 16, 2019, which the court denied on August 12, 2019. The parties also filed various requests to extend the deadlines to allow for the gathering of additional expert reports and additional data, repeatedly pushing back the end of discovery. \n\nThe Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint on January 15, 2020, nearly three years after the initial deadline for amendment of pleadings. The Plaintiffs sought to “shore up” class definitions, clarify factual issues learned in discovery, and add a claim under a Missouri statute § 544.170 that requires those arrested without a warrant to be released within 24 hours. The Plaintiffs alleged that were trying to make sure class categories match allegations in the complaint after receiving advice from an expert who helped them to sort through the information. They further alleged that the additional claim is similar enough to their initial claims that the defendants should have been given adequate notice and no additional discovery will be needed. On May 6, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff’s motion to file a second amended complaint. The court allowed plaintiffs to amend the complaint to correct demographic information on the plaintiffs and remove paragraphs no longer supported by the information revealed in discovery. However, the court denied the plaintiff's request to add an additional plaintiff as class representative, add claims under Missouri statute § 544.170, and reconfigure and add class categories, ruling that plaintiffs had failed to show “good cause” for why these amendments hadn’t taken place within the original window to amend. The Plaintiffs filed motion for reconsideration of the court's ruling on May 7, 2020.

{"document": "In 1989, Children's Rights and the ACLU filed a federal class action on behalf of children placed in foster care under the supervision of the District of Columbia's Department of Human Services (DHS), and abused and neglected children who are (or should be) known to DHS by virtue of abuse or neglect. The case asserted violations of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, due process, the District of Columbia Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the District of Columbia Youth Residential Facilities Licensor Act of 1986.\n\nIn 1991, Judge Thomas F. Hogan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia approved a negotiated remedial order following trial and a liability judgment against the defendant. LaShawn A. v. Dixon, 762 F. Supp. 959 (D.D.C. 1991).  Under the consent decree DHS agreed to develop policies and procedures in the areas of protective services; family preservation and preventive services; child placement; case reviews; adoption; staffing (qualifications, training, and caseload standards); resource development (foster homes, adoptive homes, and community based services); contracts with private providers and agencies; and development of a uniform computerized information system.\n\nThe decision was appealed and remanded a number of times. The District of Columbia argued that the remedy sought by the plaintiffs could not be provided under federal law; the Court of Appeals instructed the district court to modify the consent order to be based entirely on local law. LaShawn A. v. Kelly, 990 F.2d 1319 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The district court kept the entire content of the order finding that local law provided adequate support for the measures in the decree.\n\nIn October 1994, the plaintiffs filed a contempt motion, and the court ordered the creation of a limited receivership to address specific problems.  In 1995, the judge found defendants in contempt of court and granted plaintiffs' request for appointment of a general receiver who would run the department. LaShawn A. v. Kelly, 887 F. Supp. 297 (D.D.C. 1995).\n \nThe District made another appeal, this time regarding orders of receivership. The Court of Appeals found two orders moot, but held that the district court could not direct the receiver to disregard District law even if it interfered with the receiver's discharge of her responsibilities. LaShawn A. v. Barry, 107 F.3d 923 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\nIn June 2001, the parties proposed and the court agreed to terminate the receivership and appoint a monitor. In addition, the District agreed to create of a new agency, the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA), with cabinet-level control of child welfare matters and consolidated jurisdiction over neglect and abuse cases.  The District also agreed to fund additional lawyers to represent the CFSA in Superior Court and a variety of child welfare reforms.\n\nIn May 2003, the monitor issued a post-Receivership Implementation Plan, a comprehensive outline for reform negotiated among plaintiffs, CFSA, the District mayor, and the court monitor.  The Plan envisioned that by December 2006, defendants would fully comply with the district court's 1991 remedial order.\n\nThe monitor continued to assess defendants' progress in 2004 and 2005.  At one point during this period, the District failed to maintain an adequate number of attorneys on staff, and this failure apparently led to a severe case backlog for children who had a permanency goal of adoption. CFSA addressed the backlog and was required to ensure that such a backlog not recur.\n\nIn December 2006 (the Implementation Plan deadline), despite numerous marked improvements, CFSA had failed to comply fully with several benchmarks. Accordingly, in February 2007, the court approved a jointly-submitted Amended Implementation Plan, which established a new reform deadline of December 2008 and required CFSA to produce annual strategy plans in 2007 and 2008.\n\nSetbacks in the reform effort prompted plaintiffs to file a contempt motion against the District in July 2008. The motion cited chronic problems, including a large backlog of unresolved abuse and neglect investigations, failure to move children into permanent homes on a timely basis, and frequent moves for children in foster care.  \n\nIn an attempt to resolve these problems, the parties negotiated yet another stipulated order, approved by the Court in October 2008.  The stipulated order set forth a number of requirements that CFSA was to meet by January 2009. However, CFSA was unable to meet these requirements, and plaintiffs renewed their contempt motion in January 2009.\n\nIn April 2010, the court ruled on plaintiffs' motion, holding the District and its mayor in contempt.

The ruling cited the District's failure to implement an annual strategy plan approved by the court-appointed monitor and specifically mentioned the Mayor's failure to consult with the monitor or with plaintiffs' counsel as stipulated in the 2008 order.  In addition, the court rejected defendants' argument that under Horne v. Flores, 129 S.Ct. 2579 (2009), the consent decree should be terminated altogether.

The proposed cuts would reduce ADHC services from 5 days a week to only 3, leaving a gap in service provision for elderly and disabled people otherwise unable to care for themselves. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief for a class of individuals defined as \"all recipients of Medi-Cal in California who receive ADHC services, whose benefits would be limited, cut or terminated\" under the proposed legislation.\n\nLess than a week after they filed the case, under the impression that the reduction in ADHC services would take effect on August 27, 2009, plaintiffs sought an emergency Temporary Restraining Order. Once the plaintiffs learned that the reduction would not take place until the week of September 7, 2009, they substituted a Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\n\nOn September 10, 2009, District Court (Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong) issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the California Department of Health Care Services from reducing, terminating, or modifying the ADHC program until an appropriate alternative could be provided to prevent institutionalization of individuals in the plaintiffs' class.\n\nOn February 24, 2010, the District Court issued a second preliminary injunction preventing the defendants from \"implementing new, more restrictive eligibility requirements for ADHC services.\"\n\nOn August 10, 2010, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification.

The district court referred the motion to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, who issued an opinion and order denying the motion on Nov. 20, 2012. \n\nIn their motion, the plaintiffs alleged that the state failed to take necessary steps to prevent managed care opt-outs; that it subjected some class members to long-delayed hearing decisions; that it subjected class members to illegal Quality Assurance reviews in determining CBAS eligibility; and it had not acted to support access to CBAS and prevent loss of CBAS services due to center closures.

The Arc of West Virginia, an advocacy organization that supports students with disabilities, also joined as a plaintiff. The student had autism and ADHD. The plaintiff had been denied effective behavioral support at his school and had been repeatedly removed from the classroom. The plaintiff sued under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title II of the Americans Disabilities Act (ADA), the West Virginia Human Rights Act, and West Virginia Policy 2419. Judge Irene Berger was assigned to oversee the proceedings.\n\nThe plaintiff argued that the school district was failing to comply with the requirement under the IDEA to provide students with disabilities with a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). The FAPE standard requires \"appropriately ambitious\" special education, which KCS failed to meet. Similarly, KCS had not met its requirements under the ADA to adjust policies, practices, and procedures as necessary and to provide children with disabilities equal education opportunities. KCS did not have a current system in place to identify and provide resources for students with disabilities and instead used informal and formal removal techniques in response to behavior problems. \n\nThe plaintiffs sought class certification for a class consisting of \"[a]ll Kanawha County Schools students with disabilities who (1) need but are not receiving behavior supports from KCS, and (2) have experienced disciplinary removals from any classroom.\" The plaintiffs also sought declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically asking the Court to enjoin the defendants in revising their policies in order to provide effective behavior supports to its students with disabilities, and also provide a monitor to oversee compliance with the court order.

The case was assigned to Judge Arthur J. Turnow. The plaintiffs sued the Michigan Department of Education (MDE), Flint Community Schools (FCS), and the Genesee Intermediate School District (GISD) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. They alleged that the state of Michigan and local educators violated federal law by not screening to identify students who needed special education services. They further argued that the defendants had violated the rights of students with disabilities in the imposition of school discipline, including illegal suspensions and expulsions. The Flint parents and children were represented by the ACLU of Michigan and private counsel. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that children attending these schools were at risk of developing a disability due to their prolonged exposure to lead. Despite that risk, the schools had a pattern and practice of systematically failing to provide ongoing screening and timely referrals for evaluations to identify qualifying disabilities. Also, the schools systematically failed to provide students with disabilities with safeguards and had a pattern of using unduly harsh disciplinary measures with students with disabilities, including physical restraints and seclusion techniques. (For more information on the Flint water crisis, which involved claims of widespread lead exposure from the City's drinking water, see <a href=https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16508><i>Waid v.

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit the consideration of race in college admissions, claiming that UNC's current admissions policy discriminated against Asian American applicants.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiff claimed that UNC's current admissions policy held Asian American students to a higher standard based on their race, that UNC was engaged in a prohibited form of racial balancing, that UNC was not limiting its consideration of an applicant's race to \"merely a plus factor,\" and that a racially neutral alternative was available to achieve the same goals of diversity. \n\nAs evidence of this, the plaintiff pointed to admissions data that showed a disparity between acceptance for Asian American students at UNC and at other schools (for example, the University of California) that did not employ racial considerations in their admissions process. Additionally, the plaintiff pointed to the steady rate of acceptance of Asian American students despite the change in application rates and qualifications for those applicants. According to the plaintiff, this was evidence of a policy indistinguishable from racially based quotas for admissions. The plaintiff also pointed to a long history of admissions discrimination at UNC as evidence suggesting the current policy may have similar aims. \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Loretta C. Biggs on Jan. 12, 2015.\n\nOn Mar. 20, 2015, the parties filed a joint stipulation of voluntary dismissal of a subset of the plaintiff's claims.

The court granted permissive intervention to the current and prospective students on Jan. 13, 2017. 319 F.R.D. 490. \n\nOn Oct. 25, 2017, the defendants moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the plaintiff brought suit as \"an organizational plaintiff asserting representational standing\" but did not meet its burden of showing its members had \"indicia of membership in an organization.\" The court held on Sep. 29, 2018, that the \"indicia of membership\" test did not apply to Students for Fair Admission, since it was a voluntary membership association with actual members. The court held that Students for Fair Admission had standing because four of its members were recent high school graduates who had applied to the University of North Carolina and were denied admission. 2018 WL 4688388\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2019, the defendants moved for summary judgement, arguing that the University employed a narrowly tailored admissions policy, using the type of holistic review endorsed by the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on Mar. 4, 2019, asking the court to find as a matter of law that the University's admissions policy was not narrowly tailored.\n\nOn Sep. 30, 2019, Judge Biggs denied both motions for summary judgement. She found that there was an issue of material fact regarding UNC's use of race as a \"plus\" factor. UNC presented evidence that their system, which lists \"background\" as a factor in admissions decisions but does not assign points to students based on their race or ethnicity as it does with other categories, takes the kind of holistic approach endorsed by the Supreme Court. UNC presented expert evidence based on four years of admissions decisions that their approach considers each student individually. The plaintiffs presented conflicting expert evidence, which they claimed showed that race was a predominant factor in admissions decisions. 2019 WL 4773908\n\nJudge Biggs also found an issue of material fact regarding UNC's efforts to explore race neutral alternatives. UNC presented expert evidence that concluded that no race blind alternatives were available that would allow the university to maintain both its academic standards and racial diversity. The Plaintiffs countered that UNC had not sufficiently attempted to use race neutral alternatives such as increasing financial aid, adopting policies using geographic diversity, including percentage plans and the use of zip codes and Census tract data, reducing or eliminating preferences for legacies, or eliminating the Early Acton admissions options. \n\nA bench trial was set for May 11, 2020. \n\nThe case is ongoing.", "summary": "On November 17, 2014, Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina under The Civil Rights Act of 1964, against the University of North Carolina.

Plaintiff later withdrew this complaint to file a suit on July 19, 2016, against KUSD and its superintendent in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and Title IX of the Education Amendment (20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.). \n\nRepresented by the Transgender Law Center, along with the civil-rights law firms Relman Dane & Colfax and the Robert Pledl Law Office, Plaintiff argued that KUSD’s discriminatory actions violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. He asked the court to declare that KUSD has violated Title IX and the Fourteenth Amendment and to issue a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring KUSD to take various steps to prevent further discrimination against Plaintiff.\n\nDistrict Judge Rudolph T. Randa was assigned to the case on July 20, 2016, but due to his unavailability, the case was reassigned on August 3, 2016, to Magistrate Judge David E. Jones. Plaintiff did not consent to have a magistrate judge enter final judgment on the matter and so the case was reassigned to Judge Pamela Pepper.\n\nOn August 15, 2016, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint using his and his mother's full names because they had already consented to the media using their names. The same day, Plaintiff also filed for a preliminary injunction, asking the court to enjoin KUSD from its discriminatory practices. Attached to the motion were various supporting statements from healthcare professionals along with the U.S. Department of Education's Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students. This Dear Colleague letter was issued on May 13, 2016, and told schools that compliance with Title IX entailed treating students consistent with their gender identity (this letter was later rescinded, on February 22, 2017, under the new Trump Administration).\n\nKUSD filed a motion to dismiss the case on August 16, 2016, and the court heard oral arguments on that motion and the preliminary injunction. On September 21, 2016, Judge Pepper denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, and the next day she granted in part Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Pepper found that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits and enjoined the school from denying Plaintiff use of the boys' bathroom and from disciplining him in any way for using it. 2016 WL 5239829.\n\nKUSD appealed both decisions to the Seventh Circuit on September 23, 2016, arguing that the two orders were inextricably bound and that the appeals court could not review one without the other (originally the district court had certified the order denying the motion to dismiss for immediate interlocutory appeal, but soon after revoked that certification when it concluded it had erred by including certification language in the order). In the district court, KUSD also moved to stay the preliminary injunction, arguing that it would threaten the \"constitutionally privacy interest\" of students in the school district. On October 3, 2016, Judge Pepper denied Defendants' motion to stay. 2016 WL 8846573. Litigation continued into discovery throughout the school year. Defendants requested that Plaintiff submit to an independent medical examination. Judge Pepper denied the request as moot after Plaintiff submitted his own request governing an independent medical examination.\n\nOn May 30, 2017, the Seventh Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction and denied to review the denial of the motion to dismiss, reasoning that the two issues were not inextricably bound. Notwithstanding the intervening change in position by the Trump Administration, the Seventh Circuit found that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on his Title IX discrimination claim. The court did not reach the question of whether transgender status triggered heightened scrutiny, but the Seventh Circuit did find that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on his Equal Protection Claim on a theory of sex stereotyping. The court also found KUSD's privacy argument was based on sheer conjecture and abstraction and that a \"transgender student's presence in the restroom provides no more a risk to other students' privacy rights than the presence of an overly curious student of the same biological sex.\" 858 F.3d 1034 (Williams, J.). The Defendant appealed this order to the Supreme Court on August 29.\n\nBoth parties agreed to a settlement hearing before Magistrate Judge William E. Callahan, Jr. on November 1, 2017. Despite the efforts of the parties, mediation did not result in settlement of the Plaintiff’s claims. On November 21, 2017, the case was reassigned to Judge Pamela Pepper for further pretrial proceedings, trial, and eventual entry of final judgment.\n\nOn January 22, 2018, the parties filed a joint motion to approve the proposed Consent Judgment. The Consent Judgment: required the Defendants to pay $800,000 to the Plaintiff for compensatory damages, attorney’s fees, and costs; permanently enjoined the Defendants from preventing the Plaintiff from using male bathrooms and from taking retaliatory actions; and required the Defendants to inform current board members, district-level administrators, and school level principals and assistant principals of the terms of the permanent injunction. The judgment was set to last for 10 years, during which the court retained jurisdiction for enforcement purposes. \n\nThe Consent Judgment was signed by Judge Pepper on January 23, 2018. The Supreme Court subsequently dismissed the writ for certiorari. 138 S. Ct. 1260. The case is administratively closed, but remains ongoing due to court enforcement. As of April 15, 2020, there has been no further action in the docket.

The district court granted the plaintiff a preliminary injunction to use the boys' restroom throughout his senior year, which the Seventh Circuit upheld on May 30, 2017.

Additional examples of the alleged disparate treatment include delaying full-time hiring of black employees (which gave white employees greater seniority), denial of work opportunities that would lead to advancement, giving shorter sick leaves to black injured workers than white, granting less overtime to blacks than whites, and denying blacks - but not whites - the opportunity to choose who they worked with.\n\nThe parties reached a settlement, which the Court (Magistrate Judge Susan Cox) entered as a consent decree on September 25, 2012.

Specifically, the plaintiffs contended that the Baltimore Police Department had engaged in a pattern and practice of disparate discipline with respect to African-American police officers, claiming that the excessive subjectivity in the disciplinary process has resulted in both unintentional and/or intentional discrimination against African-American officers on the basis of their race.  The complaint alleged that African American and white officers would commit the same disciplinary offenses, but the African American officers' offenses were rated as more severe and thus they routinely received harsher discipline--including more frequent termination--as a result.  The hostile work environment alleged in the complaint included derogatory comments such as the n-word and having dog feces wrapped in an African-American-owned newspaper left on officers' desks. Other harassment allegations included nooses in lockers, being assigned to low-level duties to prevent advancement, and superior African American officers having their authority undermined by subordinate white officers.\n\nThe case settled on June 18, 2009, for $4.5 million.  The settlement sets up a $2.5 million fund to pay the individual claims of the 15 plaintiffs. The remaining $2 million will go toward nonmonetary relief -- leadership classes, training on the disciplinary process, and hiring a consultant to assist with antidiscrimination efforts.\n\n", "summary": "This is a race discrimination class action brought by black police officers in Baltimore, alleging discriminatory discipline and hostile work environment.

The DOJ began investigating whether the City of Pontiac's hiring and promotion policies discriminated against white men after <a href=\"https://www.fettlaw.com/in-the-news/firefighters-suit-spurred-probe/\"> a firefighter filed a lawsuit in July 2004 challenging the policies</a>. The DOJ alleged that the City of Pontiac and the local firefighters’ union pursued policies and practices that discriminated against applicants for employment and promotion based on race and sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The DOJ sought an injunction preventing the City of Pontiac and the union from engaging in discriminatory employment policies and practices on the basis of race or sex and from failing to compensate those who suffered a loss due to discriminatory policies and procedures. Additionally, the DOJ sought fees and   costs.      \n\nThe complaint alleged that collective bargaining agreements entered into by the Pontiac Fire Department and the local firefighters' union established a dual system for hiring and promotion, which discriminated on the basis of sex and race. The hiring and promotion policies required that one out of every three individuals hired or promoted be either a female or a minority. Two lists were maintained for the purposes of hiring and promotion. The first list included all candidates, while the second list included only the female and minority candidates. Hiring and promotion decisions were made from the first list, but if one out of three individuals hired or promoted were not either a racial minority or female, then the second list was consulted. The DOJ alleged these policies discriminated against men and non-minorities.\n\nThe parties engaged in negotiations to resolve the dispute without a trial. On July 20, 2006, the District Court (Judge George C. Steeh) granted the DOJ's motion for the provisional entry of a consent decree. The court signed the consent decree on September 28, 2006, despite objections from a number of individuals who felt they deserved compensation but fell outside the decree’s scope. The consent decree was designed to: (1) prevent future discrimination on the basis of race and gender and (2) provide remedial relief, such as backpay, offers of employment or promotion, and retroactive seniority, for those employees and applicants affected by the allegedly discriminatory policies. The consent decree specifically enjoined the defendants from: (a) engaging in or agreeing to any act or practice that discriminated on the basis of race or sex in violation of Title VII and in relation to hiring or promotion and (b) retaliating against anyone for engaging in practices protected by Title VII, including cooperating with the investigation related to this case and seeking or receiving individual relief. The consent decree also provided for individual relief and listed individuals who were eligible for such relief. Further, the consent decree imposed record-keeping and reporting obligations on the defendant and provided that the court would retain jurisdiction for a period of two years. \n\nIt does not appear that the DOJ took any action to enforce the consent decree in court over the next two years.

{"document": "On April 22, 2010, individuals who provide home care to disabled individuals enrolled\nin Illinois Medicaid-waiver programs filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the State of Illinois, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Healthcare of Illinois & Indiana,  SIEU Local 73, and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Council 31. The plaintiffs, represented by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, sought an injunction against enforcement of the agency-fee provision of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA) and a declaration that the law violated the personal assistants' fundamental rights. Plaintiffs claimed that compelling them to financially support the union for purposes of speaking to and petitioning the state infringes on their right of free association, free speech, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances under the First Amendment.\n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs work as part of the Illinois' Home Services Program. This program allows Medicaid recipients who would normally need institutional care to hire a \"personal assistant\" to provide homecare services. Under State law, the care recipients and the State both play some role in the employment relationship with the Personal Assistants. The Illinois Legislature codified this unique employment relationship by amending existing laws so as to acknowledge the right of the persons receiving care to hire and fire personal assistants or supervise them, but declaring personal assistants to be public employees of the state for the purposes of coverage under the Illinois PLRA. The Illinois PLRA authorizes state employees to join labor unions and to bargain collectively on the terms and conditions of employment. The PLRA also contains an agency-fee provision, which requires members of a bargaining unit who do not wish to join the union to nevertheless pay a fee to the union. Following a vote, SEIU Healthcare Illinois & Indiana was designated as the personal assistants' exclusive representative for purposes of collective bargaining. Plaintiffs challenged the mandatory contributions under the agency-fee provision.\n\nOn November 12, 2010, District Court Judge Sharon Coleman dismissed plaintiffs' claims with prejudice. <http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FA-IL-0012-0002.pdf\">2010 WL 4736500</a>. The district court relied on Supreme Court precedent holding that state employees can be required to contribute fair share fees to compensate unions for their representational activities. Plaintiffs appealed. On September 1, 2011, Judge Daniel Manion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's decision <http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FA-IL-0012-0003.pdf\">656 F.3d 692 (7th Cir. 2011)</a>. The appellate court held that the State of Illinois and the care recipients are joint employers of the personal care providers, and the court stated that it had no difficulty concluding that the State employs personal assistants within the meaning of Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. 431 U. S. 209 (1977) (upholding the maintaining of a union shop in a public workplace). Plaintiffs sought certiorari and the Supreme Court granted review.\n\nOn June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court overturned the Seventh Circuit's decision and held that the Illinois PLRA violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights under the First Amendment. <http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FA-IL-0012-0004.pdf\">134 S. Ct. 2618 (2014)</a>. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito was heavily critical of the Seventh Circuit's reliance on Abood. The Court noted the questionable foundations of that decision, highlighting its lack of adequate First Amendment analysis and failure to appreciate the distinction between core union speech in the public sector and core union speech in the private sector. The Court went on to stress the distinction between the full-fledged public employees at issue in Abood and the personal assistants at issue here. The Court noted that personal assistants are almost entirely answerable to the care recipient and not to the State, do not enjoy most of the rights and benefits that inure to state employees, and are not indemnified by the State for claims against them arising from actions taken during the course of their employment. Because Abood did not apply, the Court stated that the agency-fee provision of the law must serve a compelling state interest that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms. The Court found insufficient the interests contended by defendants and held the Illinois PLRA unconstitutional.", "summary": "On April 22, 2010, homecare providers who did not wish to support the designated labor union filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking an injunction against enforcement of the agency-fee provision of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA) and a declaration that the law violated the personal assistants' fundamental rights. On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court held that the clearest case on point, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. 431 U.

{"document": "On May 8, 2018, National Fair Housing Alliance, Texas Low Income Housing Information Services, and Texas Appleseed filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs were represented by the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Fair Housing Alliance, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, Public Citizen Litigation Group, and private counsel. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as attorneys’ fees and costs under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act. They claimed that a suspension of Fair Housing Act rules violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This case was assigned to Judge Beryl Howell. \n\nIn 2009, amid widespread expert agreement that its current system for ensuring local government Fair Housing Act (FHA) compliance had failed, HUD began planning a substantial overhaul, promulgating Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule (\"AFFH Rule\") in 2015. The rule required cities and counties receiving federal housing assistance to submit to HUD an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) every three to five years using a standardized template called the Assessment Tool. In the AFH, each participating local government was required to document any identified fair housing issues and outline its plans for addressing them; these plans were then reviewed by HUD for adequacy. The AFFH rule also committed HUD to providing participating cities and counties with guidance and technical support. \n\nYet on January 5, 2018, without providing advance notice or opportunity for comment, HUD published a notice in the Federal Register immediately suspending the AFH requirement of the AFFH rule. Specifically, it released local governments from submitting new assessments before October 31, 2020, and announced that it would not review any submitted AFHs before that date. The official reason given by the agency was that \"program participants needed more time to adjust to the new AFFH process\" and \"additional technical assistance may result in program participants better understanding their obligations under the AFFH rule.\" According to the plaintiffs, however, HUD had yet to take any public action to provide \"additional technical assistance.\"  \n\nIn the complaint filed on May 8, the plaintiffs asserted that these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and breached the agency's obligations under the Fair Housing Act. Yet on May 23, 2018, HUD published three related notices in the Federal Register. The first of these notices withdrew the January 5 suspension of the rule. But the second and third notices, respectively, withdrew the Assessment Tool and announced that participating jurisdictions could meet their AFFH duty if they simply \"acted in accordance\" with HUD's pre-AFFH system. \n\nIn response, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 29, 2018 alleging that the combined effect of these latter two notices was the same as the agency's initial suspension in January. They also sought preliminary injunction and summary judgment, seeking the reinstatement of the Assessment Tool and the resumption of the normal AFH submission schedule. On June 5, 2018, several states and cities filed amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs, with the State of New York also moving to intervene as a plaintiff. \n\nHUD filed its opposition brief on June 12, 2018, and later moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on July 9, arguing in both that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the lawsuit.       \n\nOn August 17, 2018, the court denied the plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction and summary judgment, and denied the State of New York's motion to intervene. It granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing. However, the plaintiffs filed a motion to alter judgment on September 14, 2018 and also sought to amend their complaint to further illustrate factual disputes they allege are grounds for reopening the case.\n\nJudge Howell denied the plaintiffs' motion to alter judgment and amend the complaint on August 26, 2019. Holding that a motion to alter judgment is an \"extraordinary remedy\" and the plaintiffs seeking reconsideration must meet a very high bar, Judge Howell found that the plaintiffs failed to meet such bar. The court found that although the plaintiffs’ claim that the final judgment was based on erroneous factual allegations, the \"judgment was not premised on factual conclusions but rather on a legal assessment of the existing regulatory regime after HUD’s contested actions.\" 397 F.Supp.3d 1.", "summary": "On May 8, 2018, several Texas organizations filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Specifically, the FHA requires that certain apartment complexes built for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 be designed and constructed with accessible and adaptable features for people with disabilities. The plaintiffs alleged, however, that since at least 2002 the defendants engaged in a continuous pattern or practice of discrimination by designing and building multifamily dwellings without these required features, thereby denying people with disabilities the use of these facilities.  \n\nOn April 5, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FH-VA-0004-0001.pdf\">amended complaint</a>, adding as defendant J. Davis Architects, which the plaintiffs alleged was the design architect on at least one of the subject properties. The amended complaint also named as defendants several property managers, and the plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin these managers from refusing to permit surveys and retrofits of the subject properties.    \n\nOn October 26, 2012, the District Court (Judge James C. Turk) entered a <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FH-VA-0004-0002.pdf\">stipulated judgment</a>, evincing the terms of a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and all the defendants except J. Davis Architects. Under the agreement, HHHunt agreed to permit accessibility surveys by a third party inspector of the nine subject properties and to retrofit inaccessible features within one to three years. Specifically, HHHunt agreed to change entry doors with high thresholds, remove large steps that block routes to entry doors, correct hazardously steep sidewalk slopes, provide adequate accessible parking, and ensure that kitchens and bathrooms have sufficient maneuvering space for wheelchair users. HHHunt also committed to pay an undisclosed sum for the plaintiffs' costs and attorneys' fees. The District Court retained jurisdiction to designate a Magistrate Judge or another person to resolve disputes between the parties.  \n\nFollowing the settlement, the only remaining claims in the lawsuit were those against J. Davis Architects. The plaintiffs contended that J. Davis drafted architectural plans for at least one of the subject properties that contained design elements that violated that FHA.   After some disagreement, the parties ultimately stipulated that J. Davis had a connection to two of the subject properties.  \n\nJ. Davis next moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that one of the plaintiffs' claims was barred by the statute of limitations. The District Court (Judge Turk) <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FH-VA-0004-0008.pdf\">denied the motion</a> on January 29, 2013, finding that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that the claim was timely, because the challenged conduct was not an isolated occurrence, but rather part of a pattern or practice that amounted to a continuing violation of the FHA. <i>Nat'l Fair Hous.

{"document": "On August 25, 2011, an individual with intellectual disabilities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The plaintiff, represented by a nonprofit impact litigation firm, sued the Director of the Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, claiming violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiff was involuntarily committed to residential services pursuant to a Florida statute but never received a periodic review of his continued need for involuntary confinement. Thus, the plaintiff asked the court for a permanent injunction that would require the defendant to adopt policies and procedures to ensure that clients who are committed to the defendant's care and custody receive state-initiated, periodic review of their involuntary commitment.\n\nOn December 19, 2011, District Judge William Stafford denied the defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the basis that the plaintiff had provided sufficient allegations to survive the motion.\n\nAfter the parties engaged in discovery, on May 22, 2012, Judge Stafford granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the basis that the APD successfully set up a nonadversarial scheme that allowed behavioral specialists the flexibility to perform tasks and make decisions for which they were trained, without having to spend unnecessary time in periodic court proceedings. The court reasoned that this scheme, when applied specifically to the plaintiff's case, was sufficient under the due process clause and periodic judicial review of involuntary commitment was not required. 2012 WL 1886438 (N.D. Fla. May 22, 2012).\n\nOn August 10, 2012, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Eleventh Circuit held on August 20, 2013, that the Supreme Court of Florida had to answer three certified questions related to the case because the Supreme Court of Florida is the \"arbiter[] of Florida law.\" These questions asked whether the \"support plan\" under a Florida statue requires that APD \"consider[s] the propriety of a continued involuntary admission for residential services,\" if APD is required under law \"to petition the circuit court for the release\" of a person from involuntary admission if the circumstances surrounding the admission have changed, and if Florida law requires that involuntary admissions are periodically reviewed. 736 F.3d 959, 973 (11th Cir. 2013). \n\nOn May 14, 2015, the Florida Supreme Court held that APD was not required to \"consider the propriety of continued involuntary admission\" and APD did not have \"to petition the circuit court for the release\" of a person who was involuntarily admitted but the circumstances surrounding the admission had changed. 175 So. 3d 710 (Fla. 2015). The case then returned to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nOn October 15, 2015, the Eleventh Circuit delivered an opinion reversing the Florida Supreme Court's decision and remanding the case to the district court on the basis that the APD scheme was not constitutionally adequate. The court held that Florida's system was in violation of the Due Process Clause because it did not require continued involuntary commitment to be reviewed by a decision-maker with the authority to order release.\n\nOn July 25, 2016, the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal, and resolved the costs and fees in a separate agreement.

{"document": "Starting in at least 2011, officials of the State of Illinois pursued plans to close up to four State Operated Developmental Centers (SODCs) within 2.5 years. SODCs are facilities for Illinois adults with severe developmental disabilities. In February 2012, Governor Quinn announced that Illinois would close Jacksonville Developmental Center and Murray Developmental Center by October 31, 2012 and 2013 respectively.  The closure plans were undertaken to shift resources towards expanding community-based care and to deal with Illinois's $13 billion budget deficit. \n\nIllinois closed the Jacksonville center on December 3, 2012. When this suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, on February 19, 2013, Illinois was in the course of transferring residents of the Murray Center to community-based options in order to enable the facility's closure.  The guardians of individuals residing in these institutions filed this suit individually on behalf of their charges and as a class action for all similarly situated disabled individuals. Some named plaintiffs claimed to have been told that Illinois would be closing all SODCs in the state. Thus the plaintiffs opposed the closures of the Jackson and Murray centers and the anticipated closure of the rest of the SODCs and brought the suit seeking declaratory relief, attorneys' fees, and an injunction preventing the planned closures.  \n\nThe plaintiffs argued that Illinois had not demonstrated that the community-based setting approach would be adequate or appropriate for individuals who are severely and profoundly developmentally disabled. The plaintiffs further argued that the closure plans discriminated against the class by targeting developmental disabilities for greater funding reductions than other disabilities, providing the class members services less effective than those provided to individuals with other disabilities, creating a substantial risk of harm, and limiting non-ambulatory individuals' access to community residential settings. The plaintiffs brought their claims under The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794), <i>Olmstead v. L.C.</i>(527 U.S. 581 (1999)), 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (for state infringement of equal protection), and various federal and state Medicaid laws. In effect, Plaintiffs argued for the right to remain institutionalized.  \n\nOn February 27, 2013, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction. \n\nOn April 15, 2013, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division filed a statement of interest opposing the injunction and the plaintiffs' interpretation of the ADA and <i>Olmstead</i>.  The DOJ explained its position that the ADA is a statute for integration, not segregation. \n\nOn May  30, 2013, the Court (Judge Marvin E. Aspen) granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order. The order, which was entered on June 12, 2013, was to prevent Illinois from transferring or discharging residents of the Murray Developmental Center without their legal guardians' written consent. Illinois was also restricted from sending residents on overnight transition visits. The order was to last until the court ruled on the motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn June 20, 2013, the Court restricted the plaintiffs' claims to those dealing with the Jacksonville and Murray centers, finding the potential closing of all SODCs to be too speculative to be ripe for adjudication. 2013 WL 3168758 (N.D. Ill. 2013). The Court also rejected the plaintiffs' interpretation of <i>Olmstead</i>, stating \"[T]his is not an Olmstead case.\" On June 28, 2013, the Court clarified that the restraining order allowed the state to consent to the transfer of wards of the Office of the State Guardian. In other words, the state as legal guardian was empowered to consent to the transfer of certain residents.\n\nOn October 8, 2013, Judge Aspen granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. The court dismissed counts IV and V against DHS and dismissed all claims against Governor Quinn. The court dismissed count III (the Olmstead claim) entirely and count IV to the extent it alleged violations of state regulatory laws relating to Medicaid. This left the equal protection claim, the ADA claim, the Rehab Act claim, and violations of federal laws pertaining to Medicaid. 2013 WL 5548929 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 8, 2013).\n\nIn January 2014, the court held a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction and possible permanent injunction. On July 21, 2014, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and lifted the temporary restraining order previously entered on June 12, 2013. 60 F. Supp. 3d 856 (N.D. Ill. 2014). The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Seventh Circuit. \n\nOn October 15, 2015, the Seventh Circuit (Judge Posner) affirmed the district court's ruling, holding that the harm to the state if the injunction were granted would outweigh the harm caused to residents if the injunction weren't granted. 803 F.3d 872 (7th Cir. 2015).\n\nThe district court dismissed the case on March 3, 2016, after the parties filed a proposed agreed order of dismissal.

{"document": "On December 22, 1995, People First of Tennessee filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against the State of Tennessee on behalf of residents of the Clover Bottom Developmental Center, Greene Valley Developmental Center, and Winston Developmental Center. The plaintiff sued the Clover Bottom Development Center and the Tennessee Department of Health under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The complaint alleged that a Department of Justice CRIPA investigation of the facilities in 1994 found a pattern of injury, abuse, and neglect, deficient medical care, a lack of activities, and a failure to provide educations to school-age children as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. It also alleged the use of unnecessary restraints, inadequate discharge planning, and failure to provide habilitation and training. The People First of Tennessee, represented by the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia and private counsel, sought injunctive relief to permanently enjoin the defendants from continuing the acts, practices, and omissions described above.\n\nOn November 15, 1996, the United States Department of Justice also filed a lawsuit in the Middle District of Tennessee against the state, alleging similar violations.  That case was styled U.S. v. Tennessee Civ. No. 96-cv-01056 (M.D.Tenn.) (\"United States case\") (See ID-TN-0004).\n\nOn December 2, 1996, the district court (Judge Robert L. Echnols) granted a motion to consolidate the People First case with the United States case.  \n\nPeople First, the Department of Justice, and the State of Tennessee entered into a settlement agreement, which was approved by Judge Echnols on November 27, 1996.  In the settlement, the state agreed to, among other things:\n\n•\tCreate person-centered evaluation of citizens in need of services\n•\tDevelop community programs and resources\n•\tIncrease staffing and staff training\n•\tImprove living conditions in the centers\n•\tProvide education for school-age residents\n\nOn the same date, the court granted plaintiff People First of Tennessee's motion to amend their complaint.  \n\nAccording to the PACER docket, litigation continued after the settlement regarding defendants' compliance with the settlement agreement, the Parent-Guardian Association's (PGA) intervention in the action, and attorneys' fees.     \n\nCommunity Rehabilitation Agencies of Tennessee (CMRA), an association of agencies providing services to individuals with intellectual disabilities, moved to intervene in the consolidate suits.  The court (Judge Jon McCalla) denied the motions for each case.  On August 8, 2001, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (District Judge John Feikens, Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation) affirmed the denials. U.S. v. Tennessee, 260 F.3d 587 (6th Cir. 2001).  \n\nOn Mar. 18, 2002, the court ordered the case administratively closed in light of the ongoing settlement process. The court allowed the case to be reopened by either party. \n\nThe case was reopened on Feb. 22, 2006 to address the state's motion for partial termination of the settlement regarding Greene Valley Developmental Center. The settlement agreement allowed the state to seek partial termination of the agreement after two years if the state showed compliance with provisions related to institutional care services and protection from harm. The court had to address if \"the State has substantially complied with\" the provisions. The court granted the motion on Mar. 16, 2006, finding that the state had achieved compliance with respect to the conditions at the Greene Valley Developmental Center. \n\nThe court terminated the settlement agreement with respect to the Harold Jordan Center on Sept. 30, 2008, finding that the state showed compliance with provisions related to institutional care services and protection from harm at that particular facility. \n\nThe court once again ordered the case administratively closed on Mar. 31, 2009. While the case remained closed, a series of procedural developments occurred. First, on Nov. 19, the state indicated that budgetary considerations compelled it to close the Clover Bottom Developmental Center and Harold Jordan Center. On Dec. 21, 2009, the PGA filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in response to the state's asserted intent to close the facilities without a comprehensive closure plan. The court denied the motion on Jan. 12, 2010, holding that the parties did not make a sufficient effort to confer with the state, as required by the settlement agreement, before bringing their motion. \n\nAfter many months of negotiation, the parties drafted an exit plan that established criteria that, if the state satisfied, would result in a dismissal of this case. The court approved the exit plan on Jan. 29, 2015. A year later, on Jan. 12, 2016, the court found that the state had complied with the exit plan provisions and ordered the case dismissed with prejudice. The court also vacated previously-granted injunctive relief, except as to class members residing at Greene Valley Developmental Center while they continued to reside there. The court maintained jurisdiction over the matter only as to these residents. On Sept. 8, 2017, after the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the case as to the outstanding injunction, the court dismissed the case with prejudice, finding that the state was in full compliance with the exit plan as to Greene Valley Developmental Center. \n\nThroughout the course of this litigation, the court awarded installments of attorneys' fees and reimbursements totaling $2,778,833.84 for the plaintiffs and $753,433.86 for the PGA. \n\nThe case was then closed, though the court currently retained jurisdiction solely over matters related to attorneys' fees. On November 9, 2017, People First filed a final motion for attorneys' fees. The PGA filed a similar motion the following day. On November 14, 2017, the court granted both motions, awarding People First $377,944.28 and PGA  $65,750. All motions for attorneys' fees have been resolved.

Plaintiff alleged that employees of Fruit Patch, Inc. engaged in a massive scheme to hire undocumented immigrants for the express purpose of depressing employee wages. In furtherance of their scheme, defendants are alleged to have recruited over 100 undocumented immigrants to work in their plants, provided housing for them and turned a blind eye to obviously fake work papers.  Plaintiff further alleged that after defendants were notified of workers using false social security numbers, the undocumented workers would then simply assume new bogus identities and continue working.  Plaintiff alleges that defendants' scheme violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., and the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a), et seq.

{"document": "This case is about the ability of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to issue new guidelines on asylum application procedures and whether DHS is allowed to issue a rule that asylum seekers must first apply for asylum in another country before applying in the U.S..\n\nOn July 16, 2019, four advocacy organizations -- the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, Al Otro Lado, Innovation Law Lab, and the Central American Resource Center -- challenged a new asylum policy of the Trump administration narrowing eligibility qualifications for asylum seekers. The rule blocked asylum for noncitizens who transited through another country prior to reaching the southern U.S. border. The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq., and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. This lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California and assigned to Judge Jon S. Tigar. \n\nThe complaint had three key arguments. First, plaintiffs argued that Congress made clear that noncitizens may apply for asylum regardless of where they enter the U.S., and that many necessarily transit through another country before reaching a U.S. port of entry. U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). The complaint emphasized the distinction between firm resettlement barring eligibility for asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A), and temporary transit through another country. Second, plaintiffs argued that the rule jeopardized the international law principle of non-refoulment which prohibits the forcible return of asylum seekers to countries where they would be persecuted. Third, plaintiffs argued that the government failed to follow procedural steps required by the APA, including providing notice and an opportunity to comment prior to enacting the Rule.\n\nOn July 24, 2019, the Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the government from implementing the rule due to the government’s failure to comply with notice and comment procedures of the APA and the balance of public interests. 385 F.Supp.3d 922.\n\nOn July 29, 2019, the government requested a stay of the injunction pending an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the nationwide scope of the injunction was unwarranted and would serve to undermine the constitutional and statutory authority of the Executive Branch. On August 16, 2019, the Ninth Circuit denied a stay for application of the injunction inside its boundaries. The Ninth Circuit granted the stay pending appeal for all locations outside the Ninth Circuit, finding that the nationwide scope of the injunction was not supported by the record in the district court. 934 F.3d 1026. The plaintiffs then moved in the district court to restore the nationwide scope of the injunction, supplementing the record the appeals court had found inadequate. \n\nOn September 9, 2019, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to restore the nationwide scope of the injunction, viewing it as the only sufficient remedy to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs, as well as necessary to maintain uniform immigration policy. 391 F.Supp.3d 974. The government again appealed to the Ninth Circuit and filed an emergency motion for a stay. While the stay issue was being briefed, the Supreme Court granted a stay pending disposition of the government's appeal to the Ninth Circuit (140 S.Ct. 3). The government again appealed the injunction to the Ninth Circuit on July 6, 2020. \n\nWhile the injunction was on appeal, but before the change of administration, the Department of Homeland Security issued a separate “final rule” on the asylum issue that was substantially similar to the one the district court had preliminarily enjoined. On January 28, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking to enjoin the government from implementing this new rule as well. The district court granted that injunction on February 16, 2021. \n\nOn January 21, 2021, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction and stay of the final rule's effective date. Judge Tigar granted the preliminary injunction and stay of the effective date on February 16.\n\nIn in April 2021, the Ninth Circuit upheld the original injunction and found that the rule change was arbitrary and capricious because the government did not take the evidence in front of the agency into account when making the rule change, and that the balance of harms favored upholding the injunction (994 F. 3d 962). The Ninth Circuit also found that the district court did not abuse its discretion by applying the injunction along the four states bordering Mexico.\n\nThe case is ongoing, but is likely to terminate soon due to the inauguration of the Biden Administration. There has been no movement on the trial court docket since the court of appeals mandate in April.", "summary": "On July 16, 2019, the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, Al Otro Lado, Innovation Law Lab, and the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles brought this suit against the U.S. Attorney General and  Secretary of Homeland Security.

{"document": "On November 20, 2014, Joe Arpaio, the Sheriff of Maricopa County in Arizona, filed this lawsuit in the D.C. District Court against President Obama, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the U.S. Attorney General. Sheriff Arpaio sued under the Declaratory Judgment Act(28 U.S.C. § 2201) and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff claimed that two federal programs constituted unconstitutional abuses of the President's power:\n\n1) The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program started on June 15, 2012; and \n2) Several additional programs-- referred to by the plaintiff as Executive Order Amnesty (EOA) programs-- started on November 20, 2014\n\nDACA allowed some undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S. EOA extended DACA to defer action for childhood arrivals who arrived after the earliest cut-off date and for parents and other relatives of U.S. citizens or persons lawfully present.\n\nSpecifically, Sheriff Arpaio claimed that the challenged programs constituted a dramatic departure from prior interpretation and application of existing law and regulations and that the President cannot effect these changes by Executive Order. Plaintiff also argued that even if the Court deemed these dramatic changes constitutional, the challenged programs should have gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures under the APA. Alternatively, Plaintiff challenged these actions pursuant to the APA as unlawful and invalid as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, unreasonable, and/or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n\nOn December 4, 2014, Plaintiff sought a Preliminary Injunction and filed a brief, which the court construed as a motion to dismiss.  On December 23, 2014, District Judge Beryl A. Howell denied the preliminary injunction and dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Judge Howell found that the plaintiff did not suffer a legally cognizable injury, and thus held that the Plaintiff lacked standing. Sheriff Arpaio, the Court explained, did not suffer injury in fact in his personal capacity because he sought to vindicate only a general interest in proper application of Constitution and laws.  Although he alleged that undocumented immigrants had targeted him for assassination as a result of his stance on illegal immigration, neither of the challenged programs threatened the sheriff's life; in fact, his stance on illegal immigration existed prior to this case and the challenged programs.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: A class of asylum seekers detained by the New Orleans ICE Field Office filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that defendants be compelled to conduct individual parole reviews for every detainee and to consider the risk of COVID-19 to them in determining their eligibility for parole.  On April 21, 2020, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction. <hr>\n\nOn May 30, 2019, asylum seekers detained under the jurisdiction of the New Orleans ICE Field Office filed this class action lawsuit under the Administrative Procedure Act and 28 U.S.C.§§ 1361 and 1651 against the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); the Acting Director of ICE; the Acting Executive Associate Director ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations; and the Acting Director of the New Orleans ICE Field Office.  Represented by the ACLU of Louisiana and Southern Poverty Law Center, the plaintiffs argued that DHS has ignored a 2009 Parole Directive, denying parole to more than 98% of arriving asylum seekers.  The plaintiffs also argued that the New Orleans ICE Field Office conducted sham parole reviews and blanket denials of parole, violating their Due Process rights under the Fifth Amendment.  The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief preventing the defendants from detaining the plaintiffs without individualized parole reviews that determined the risk of flight or danger to the community.  The plaintiffs' proposed class was \"all arriving asylum seekers who receive positive credible fear determinations; and who are or will be detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; after having been denied parole by the New Orleans ICE Field Office.\"\n\nOn May 30, 2019, the case was related to Damus v. Neilsen.  <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16498\">here</a>.\n\nOn June 28, 2019, the plaintiffs moved to certify class, proposing that the class be defined as: \"(1) all arriving asylum seekers (2) who are found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture and (3) who are or will be detained by U.S. Immigration and Customers Enforcement; (4) after having been denied parole under the authority of the New Orleans ICE Field Office.\" \n\nOn July 18, 2019, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendants from continuing to detain asylum seekers without individualized consideration of flight risk or danger to the community. \n\nOn August 5, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that some of the plaintiffs were no longer in ICE custody, others had had their parole requests adjudicated, and additional plaintiffs were no longer eligible for parole.  \n\nOn September 5, 2019, Judge James E. Boasberg issued an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, granting the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, and granting in part and denying in part the defendants' motion to dismiss.  In granting the preliminary injunction, Judge Boasberg found that the New Orleans ICE Field Office had ceased to follow the 2009 Directive.  Class certification was granted because the proposed class met the requirements under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The defendants' motion to dismiss was only granted in regards to plaintiffs' due process claim.  2019 WL 4225322.\n\nOn November 1, 2019, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court. On November 18, 2019, the appeal was docketed as 19-5306.\n\nOn January 9, 2020, Judge Boasberg issued an order directing the defendants to distribute copies of the class notice to all provisional class members.  \n\nOn March 31, 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction.  The plaintiffs sought to compel the defendants to conduct immediate case by case parole assessments for all class members to address the COVID-19 pandemic.  The plaintiffs also requested that defendants be required to consider the risk of COVID-19 to individuals when conducting their individualized assessment.  \n\nOn April 7, 2020, the defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to the emergency motion for a preliminary injunction.  They argued that the motion should be denied because plaintiffs had failed to show that ICE had violated the Parole Directive, had failed to establish irreparable harm if they were not given new parole reviews, and that the plaintiffs' request was not in the public interest.  \n\nOn April 8, the plaintiffs filed their reply to the defendants' memorandum.  The plaintiffs pointed out that the COVID-19 pandemic continued to worsen and that the continuation of blanket parole denials put the health of plaintiffs and detention officials at the risk of irreparable harm.  \n\nOn April 21, 2020, Judge Boasberg denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion for a preliminary injunction, asserting that the court had already enjoined the defendants to follow their parole direct, and thus it was unnecessary to do so again.  The court left open the possibility that plaintiffs could file a motion for contempt asserting that defendants had not complied with the court's original injunction. \n\nThe plaintiffs did just that and filed a motion for order to show cause why the defendants should not be held in contempt for violating the 2019 preliminary injunction order, expedited discovery, and the appointment of a special master on May 12. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants continue to disregard the Parole Directive in violation of the preliminary injunction. They claimed that parole grant rates remained below 25% for redetermination applications and below 20% for first-time applicants and in some cases facilities held zero parole redeterminations in March and April. In their response filed on June 16, the defendants argued that in the recent months ICE had granted parole at rates closer to 30% and that there was not clear and convincing evidence that they were not following the preliminary injunction.\n\nMeanwhile, in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the defendants filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the appeal on June 16. The D.C. Circuit granted the motion and dismissed the appeal on June 29. 2020 WL 3635095.\n\nBack in the district court, on July 22, 2020, Judge Boasberg granted the plaintiffs’ motion seeking discovery regarding compliance with the preliminary injunction, a finding of contempt, and appointment of a Special Master in part. He found the plaintiffs raised sufficient question of compliance and ordered limited discovery. He denied without prejudice the motion with respect to the finding of contempt and the appointment of a special master, with these requests to be renewed following discovery and a potential hearing on the defendants’ violations. The parties then began engaging in limited discovery with a joint status report on the discovery due October 30, 2020. \n\nAs the parties engaged in limited discovery, on August 20, 2020, The Center for Investigative Report filed a motion to intervene to unseal the defendants’ monthly production of parole determinations and any future productions in order to inform the public debate over DHS’s application of parole procedures to asylum seekers. Judge Boasberg granted the motion to intervene on October 10. He ordered for DHS’s future monthly submissions to include a public version of the parole determinations without personally identifiable information and for DHS to file redacted versions of prior reports.\n\nThe defendants continued to file monthly status reports and both parties continued   joint status reports.

Plaintiffs, who were from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, were admitted to the U.S. under the H-2B temporary farm worker program. The plaintiffs alleged that they planted trees and performed other forestry related work for the defendant, but that the defendant took advantage of them by grossly underpaying them in violation of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The case was assigned to Judge Clarence Cooper.\n\nThe District Court granted class certification on September 28, 2006. <i>Leon-Granados v. Eller and Sons Trees, Inc.</i>, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73781 (N.D. Ga.  Sept. 28, 2006). That same day, Judge Cooper issued a discovery order and held that the applicable statute of limitations for the AWPA claims was six years. <i>Leon-Granados v. Eller and Sons Trees, Inc.</i>, 452 F.Supp.2d 1282 (N.D. Ga. 2006). Defendants appealed the class certification order.

Aug. 31, 2007).\n\nWhile the case was on appeal, discovery continued, as the District Court refused defendants' request to stay the case proceedings. On November 15, 2007, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on one of their multiple claims under FLSA--their claim for reimbursement of passport, visa and travel expenses incurred in coming to work for Defendants--as well as on their claim of non-compliance with the AWPA. On October 7, 2008, the court granted Plaintiffs' partial summary judgment motion for the FLSA claim. <i>De Leon-Granados v. Eller & Sons Trees, Inc.</i>, 581 F. Supp. 2d 1295, 1313 (N.D. Ga. 2008). The court found that Eller and Sons failed to reimburse their guest workers for travel and visa expenses incurred when they came to the United States to work for the company, failed to provide them all the hours of work they were promised in their H-2B work contracts, and failed to maintain accurate records of the hours they worked. Plaintiffs were awarded $57,001.28 in damages (after court granted plaintiffs' motion to correct summary judgment order). However, the Court was unable to rule on the AWPA claim. The defendants had moved to strike the plaintiffs' expert witness, a veteran wage and hour investigator who had reviewed the defendants' records. Without that testimony, the Court could not rule on the AWPA claim, so it would have to wait until the motion was resolved.\n\nOn October 30, 2008, the defendants withdrew their motion to strike the plaintiffs' expert witness. They then moved for an interlocutory appeal on November 4, 2008.\n\nThe interlocutory appeal was fought over until September 14, 2009 when the Court denied the appeal because (1) it \"would not materially advance the ultimate termination of this litigation,\" and (2) final judgment would likely follow a damages hearing, and the defendants could just appeal then. 2009 WL 10696537. In the same order, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgement on the AWPA claim, holding that the defendants' payroll had failed to meet the AWPA requirements. It found that, following testimony by the plaintiffs' expert witness, there was no genuine issue of material fact that the defendants had kept inaccurate records and were sometimes intentionally underreporting workers' hours to evade wage payment obligations.\n\nThe plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint on July 22, 2010, clarifying requested damages. They then moved for statutory damages on August 6, 2010.\n\nThe defendant filed for bankruptcy on September 23, 2010, but the Court ordered on November 4, 2010 that litigation would proceed anyway. The parties proceeded with negotiations in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana until June 4, 2012 when that court issued an order that the parties had come to a settlement agreement.\n\nBack in the district court, on September 28, 2012, Judge Cooper granted the plaintiffs' motion for statutory damages pursuant to the AWPA claim. Finding that the defendants were clearly aware of the requirements but willfully ignored them, that these were far more than \"mere technical violations,\" and that each class member would be receiving only a small amount, he awarded statutory damages to the plaintiff class near to the maximum allowable: $499,858.74. 2012 WL 13065433.

{"document": "This case is one of several brought nationwide by States, counties, and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration's revised public charge rule, which expands the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. This case was filed in the fall of 2018, after the State Department made changes to its Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) that revised the public charge rule. The State Department officially implemented the rule in the fall of 2019, shortly after DHS announced its own implementation of the rule. Although the DHS rule was quickly enjoined, the State Department's rule wasn't enjoined until July 29, 2020 in <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17353\">Make the Road New York v.

The City sued U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, and the U.S. Department of State (DOS) under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Bivens for violations of Fifth Amendment equal protection. The plaintiffs, represented by the Democracy Forward Foundation and the City of Baltimore Department of Law, sought attorneys’ fees and declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from enforcing January 2018 changes to the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual. The changes were to instructions to consular officers on how to determine the likelihood a visa applicant would become a public charge if admitted to the United States. The City alleged that the increase in public benefit listed in the new definition would, in effect, decrease the number of immigrants eligible to apply for visas. The changes were made without providing the public legally required notice, explanation, and opportunity for comment. The case was assigned to Judge Ellen Hollander.\n\nThe changes to the FAM increased the types of programs that the federal government would consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides that if a consular officer finds that a person seeking a visa is likely to become a public charge, that person is “inadmissible.” Thus, an immigrant who uses non-cash benefits such as food stamps or Medicaid may be found more likely to be a public charge and inadmissible for purposes of a visa. The plaintiffs asserted that the effect of this Rule would be to force immigrant families to choose between using these benefits or risk failing to gain entry to the U.S.\n\n<u>Defendants Move to Dismiss</u>\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on February 25, 2019. They argued that the City of Baltimore lacked subject matter jurisdiction and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Moreover, even if the City overcame these hurdles, the defendants argued that it still failed to plausibly allege that the FAM changes violated either the APA or equal protection.\n\nOn September 20, 2019, Judge Hollander denied the motion. She held that the City was affected by the changes and could sue on behalf of the immigrants affected. She also found that sufficient allegations had been provided to sue President Trump under the equal protection claim. Finally, she upheld the APA claim on the grounds that changes to the FAM are subject to notice and comment, and that there could be grounds for an injunction.\n\n<u>The Rule is Officially Implemented by the State Department</u>\nOn October 11, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security's similar public charge rule (DHS Rule) began to be enjoined by courts around the country.

This rule mirrored the DHS Rule, explicitly expanding the definition of \"public charge\" for the purposes of granting visas.\n\n<u>The Fight Over Discovery</u>\nOn October 20, defendants filed their answer to the complaint, and a Scheduling Order for discovery was issued on November 5.\n\nOn top of requesting documents from DOS, the City requested interrogatories of Secretary Pompeo and President Trump.

She vacated the previous Scheduling Order and denied discovery beyond the administrative record on the equal protection claim, holding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to discovery because this was an immigration issue and that the administrative record would suffice. However, she denied the motion for the APA claims, finding that the plaintiffs could proceed with the administrative record and pursue extra-record discovery afterward if needed. 429 F.Supp.3d 128.\n\nOn February 7, 2020, the City supplemented its complaint to include the Interim Final Rule.\n\n<u>Parties Move for Summary Judgment</u>\nOn May 15, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.\n\nOn June 12, the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and also filed a cross motion for summary judgment.\n\n<u>The FAM Changes and the Interim Final Rule are Enjoined</u>\nOn July 29, the FAM changes and the Interim Final Rule were enjoined nationwide by the District Court for the Southern District of New York in <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17353\">Make the Road New York v.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a class-action habeas petition brought on May 4, 2020, by two individuals in ICE custody, seeking better access to phone calls. The defendants moved to dismiss the case on June 29. No outcome so far. <hr> \n\nOn May 4, 2020, two individuals in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) brought this lawsuit against ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security. They complained about ICE's restrictions on telephone access--the high cost of phone calls and the denial of incoming calls. Both restrictions predated the COVID-19 pandemic. But they alleged that because in-person visitation had become impossible, the phone restrictions unconstitutionally violated their Fifth and First Amendment rights, preventing communication with counsel and denying their right to legal representation. One plaintiff alleged that since pandemic restrictions began, communications with his attorney have been very challenging. Another pointed to a delay of a month in his asylum hearing (prolonging his detention) because he had been unable to have a meaningful preparatory call with his counsel. The plaintiffs’ proposed class includes \"all current and future adult immigration detained persons who are or will be held in ICE custody in El Paso or Otero.\" Represented by private counsel and the American Immigration Council, the plaintiffs framed the lawsuit as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, and as an injunctive and declaratory action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico and assigned to Magistrate Judge Gregory B. Wormuth. The case was later reassigned to Judge James A. Parker on June 5.\n\nOn June 29, the defendants moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction and the plaintiff's failure to state a claim. They argued that the plaintiffs could not bring claims relating to injuries they have not personally suffered and that the plaintiffs could not bring this case in district court as the Immigration and Nationality Act contains a jurisdiction-channeling provision that requires exclusive review in the federal courts of appeals. The plaintiffs responded that the jurisdictional bar does not apply where claims address systemwide detention conditions that are collateral to the removal process and are effectively unreviewable through a petition for review. They further argued that they have standing to bring the action on behalf of the proposed class and that they stated a proper Due Process claim. \n\nThe plaintiffs then moved for a preliminary injunction on August 26, claiming that despite the increased reliance of telephone calls due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ICE's acknowledgment of a need to expand telephone access, restrictive practices at Otero have rendered all communications nearly impossible. \n\nIn its opposition to the preliminary injunction on September 9, the defendants argued that because the court has not certified a class, any injunctive relief must be limited to the named plaintiffs.

On April 1, 2020, Judge Karin J. Immergut denied the plaintiffs' motion, finding the relief requested to be too attenuated from the claims underlying the plaintiffs' initial complaint. On July 31, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion to dismiss. The defendants then filed a motion for reconsideration on September 4, which was denied on September 15. <hr>\n\nOn December 18, 2019, six immigration legal service providers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, alleging that the federal government had manipulated the immigration adjudication system in a way that makes it virtually impossible for asylum seekers to win their cases. The organizations (Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., Innovation Law Lab, Santa Fe Dreamers Project, and Southern Poverty Law Center), sued President Trump, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), under the U.S. Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Represented by Innovation Law Lab, Southern Poverty Law Center, and private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution, as well as provisions of the INA and the APA. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Stacie Beckerman.\n\nIn their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had abused their authority to perpetuate “asylum-free zones”—immigration court jurisdictions where asylum is virtually impossible to win, thus nullifying the U.S. asylum statutory scheme. The plaintiffs also claimed that by burdening the immigration courts with a backlog of more than a million cases, the defendants had undermined fairness in the system and impaired the INA’s case-by-case decision-making process. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that by implementing new performance metrics for immigration judges (the Metrics Policy) and a rapid-removal family docketing directive (the FAMU Directive), the defendants had impaired the impartiality of immigration judges  and undermined the fairness of proceedings for recently-arrived families. As immigration legal service providers, the plaintiffs stated that the defendants’ efforts had denied them a fair forum in which to vindicate their organization missions. \n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss on March 20, 2020. \n\nOn March 27, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In their request, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants’ actions in response to the pandemic had turned the immigration court system into a public health hazard. Specifically, they claimed that the defendants were continuing to require attorneys, respondents, judges, and staff to appear in person at many immigration courts, refusing to extend deadlines despite the danger associated with compliance, failing to provide adequate notice of emergency court closures and procedures, and ordering immigration judges to fast-track cases to completion (i.e. deportation) in the absence of respondents and counsel. \n\nThe plaintiffs sought a temporary injunction under the All Writs Act to require the defendants to take reasonable steps to the protect public health in the immigration courts, including: no longer compelling respondents to appear in person or holding hearings without the consent of the respondent or their counsel, no longer invoking in absentia procedures to order removal in cases where respondents fail to appear, tolling deadlines, waiving certain filing requirements, and allowing attorneys not to appear in person without being held in contempt. \n\nThe same day, the case was reassigned to Judge Karin J. Immergut. \n\nA group of former immigration judges and members of the Board of Immigration Appeals filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs’ request for a TRO on March 30, 2020.\n\nOn April 1, 2020, Judge Immergut denied the plaintiffs’ motion. In an April 2 order, she explained that the relief sought by the plaintiffs was too attenuated from the claims alleged in their complaint to sustain their burden for a temporary injunction under the All Writs Act. Judge Immergut also noted that the defendants demonstrated that they had taken significant steps to reduce in-person contacts and modify immigration court functions in the wake of the pandemic. Consequently, she did not find it necessary to grant the sweeping relief sought by the plaintiffs. \n\nOn July 31, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion to dismiss, dismissing the plaintiffs' claims that sought enjoinder of “asylum-free zones”—i.e. immigration courts with unusually high rates of denials for asylum applications— for lack of jurisdiction. 2020 WL 4431682. However, all of the remaining claims were allowed to proceed. \n\nThe defendants sought reconsideration on September 4. They argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over claims arising from or relating to removal proceedings. The defendants also claimed that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. \n\nThe defendants' motion for reconsideration was denied on September 15, as it repeated and expounded upon arguments previously made without a new basis for reconsideration. The district court also noted that it was bound by Ninth Circuit precedent, <i>East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump</i>, which recognized organizational standing for immigration services organizations when they can establish their own injury. The court also found that it had jurisdiction because the plaintiffs' asserted injuries did not arise from any removal proceeding and were not cognizable under the petition-for-review process. \n\nThe case is ongoing.", "summary": "A group of immigration legal service providers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon on December 18, 2019, alleging the federal government had manipulated the immigration adjudication system in a way making it virtually impossible for asylum seekers to succeed.

The prisoners, represented by the ACLU of Southern California, asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated. Specifically, they claimed that violence by LASD deputies—\"sadistic beat[ing] of inmates\" that included \"broken legs, fractured eye sockets, shattered jaws, broken teeth, severe head injuries, nerve damage, dislocated joints, collapsed lungs, and wounds requiring dozens of stitches and 22 staples\"—violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs.\n\nThis case's origins lie in the landmark case Rutherford v.

The plaintiffs also alleged that a culture of violence had taken root in the county jail, citing multiple incidences of mentally ill prisoners being beaten and men being beaten for witnessing other beatings. The plaintiffs also alleged that several of these beatings resulted in disciplinary segregation for the victims. Other incidents were witnessed by chaplains, in-jail educators, and visitors. The plaintiffs described taunting and beatings that were were racially motivated, disproportionately affected the mentally ill, and constituted punishment for perceived slights rather than violations of jail policy.

{"document": "On May 1, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of inmates from the Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation Department Jail (MDRC), filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against officials from Miami-Dade County for alleged violation of the inmates' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The suit alleged that the defendants failed to provide suicide protection and mental health care to the inmates, causing the inmates to suffer serious harm. \n\nOn May 22, 2013, the Court (Judge William J. Zloch) entered a consent decree that revised the standard of medical care to be provided by the MDCR facilities and monitoring of the implementation of this care.  The consent decree also included compliance with federal standards of mental health care and suicide prevention. The case was dismissed without prejudice.\n\nThe U.S. submitted a series of eight status reports regarding compliance between November 2013 and January 2017. The parties held status conferences with the court subsequent to each report. The reports found that the County was substantially not in compliance with the consent agreement. On December 7, 2014, the parties submitted the first revised summary action plan that itemized each compliance issue with specific dates. The dates of compliance spanned from May 11, 2015 to November 30, 2016. Monitoring continued in the interim. Compliance was not reached by the deadline and parties submitted a second revised summary action plan on May 18, 2016; it was approved on May 23, 2016. The dates in the second revised summary action plan spanned July 2016 to February 2017. A full compliance tour was scheduled for September 2017 but was rescheduled for December 2017 due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nOn January 11, 2017, Judge Zloch recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge Beth Bloom. Status reports and conferences resumed in February and continued through May when Judge Bloom ordered the County to begin submitting monthly reports to the court due to its continued lack of compliance. The County continued submitting status reports monthly until February 2018. \n\nOn January 19, 2018, the independent monitor found that the County was still not in compliance. On February 9, 2018 Judge Bloom ordered the parties to write a new summary action plan with a final deadline by which the County would achieve full compliance with the settlement agreement or face sanctions. The parties submitted a new summary action plan on February 14, 2018. The Court ordered this third plan and the final compliance date was set to be April 16, 2018. If the County was not in compliance by that date, sanctions would be filed against them. The County continued to file monitoring reports, but was still not in compliance by the final deadline in the third settlement agreement. The United States filed sanctions against the county on April 30, 2018; the Court ordered these sanctions on May 4, 2018. Also on May 4, the court approved a fourth revised settlement agreement that set the final compliance date to be June 21, 2018. The United States decided not to pursue sanctions following this order on May 11, 2018. \n\nStatus reports continued throughout 2018 and early 2019 with the County making progress on the settlement agreement. On March 29, 2019, after the United States had moved for a stay on the compliance deadlines from the fourth summary action plan, the parties informed the court of a final action plan to achieve full compliance. They agreed to file a joint declaration when the County had achieved compliance with the final action plan and set the deadline for full compliance with the settlement agreement to be after the final monitoring tour of the County’s facilities on September 27-29, 2019, with the subsequent monitoring report and conference being completed by November 7, 2019. The parties filed this information in a joint declaration on June 16, 2019. \n\nOn November 7, 2019, a status conference was held but the County was still not in full compliance. The Court ordered the parties to develop a compliance timetable, which they submitted on November 12, 2019. The County continued to file monthly status reports, as per the compliance timetable, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the parties decided to reschedule the twelfth monitoring tour for October 12, 2020 tentatively, on April 2, 2020. Compliance efforts (monitoring reports submitted by the county and monthly conference calls between the parties) would continue in the meantime.

{"document": "On February 11, 2004, two named plaintiffs filed this civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  In their complaint (as amended nine days later), the plaintiffs challenged the Cook County Sheriff's policy of strip searching all males following their return to the Cook County Jail from court after there was a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention.  The plaintiffs also alleged that female detainees were not subjected to similar treatment, as they were placed in a holding cell after returning from court and processed out of the jail without being strip searched or re-entering the general housing units.  The strip searches without reasonable suspicion and the differential treatment, the plaintiffs alleged, violated their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The plaintiffs sought monetary damages, injunctive relief and class certification.\n\nThe defendants generally denied the allegations and contended that the strip searches were necessary, for there was no space in the jail to construct additional bullpens to house the discharged male detainees so that they would not be required to enter the housing units and undergo strip searches.\n\nOn November 22, 2004, the District Court (District Judge Elaine Bucklo) certified the case as a class action, with the class defined as follows:  all male inmates who, on or after February 12, 2002, have been subjected to defendants' policy, practice and custom of strip searching, without reasonable suspicion that the inmate is concealing a weapon or other contraband, at the Cook County Department of Corrections, following their return from court after there had been a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention, other than to be processed for release.  Bullock v. Sheahan, 225 F.R.D. 227 (N.D. Ill. 2004).\n\nDiscovery ensued and included substantial document production, depositions and experts.  The defendants sought to preclude the testimony of one of plaintiffs' retained experts, Donald Henry.  Mr. Henry was a registered architect specializing in the design of prisons and jails and was retained by the plaintiffs to inspect the jail and offer an opinion whether there was adequate space for the construction of additional bullpens to hold male detainees.  Judge Bucklo denied the motion.  Bullock v. Sheahan, 519 F.Supp.2d 760 (N.D.Ill. 2007).\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the following four claims: <ul> <li> The strip searching of all male court discharged persons and not all female court discharged persons violated the Equal Protection Clause.\n<li>The strip searching of all male court discharged persons in large non-private group settings, with up to fifty inmates, while the female court discharged persons who opted to return to the housing divisions were afforded privacy, violated the Equal Protection Clause.\n<li>The strip searching of all male court discharged persons not based upon reasonable suspicion that they were concealing contraband violated the Fourth Amendment.\n<li>The manner in which the strip searches were conducted, in large non-private group settings, violated the Fourth Amendment. </ul> Defendants moved to strike portions of plaintiffs' motion (as to the second and fourth claim), asserting that plaintiffs were adding new theories of liability not pleaded in their amended complaint.  Judge Bucklo denied the motion to strike, but allowed defendants to conduct additional discovery as to those claims.  Bullock v. Sheahan, 519 F.Supp.2d 763 (N.D.Ill. 2007).\n\nOn July 30, 2008, the district court (Judge Bucklo) granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.   The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, and on February 27, 2009, Judge Bucklo partially granted that motion with respect to the portions of the earlier order that granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their Fourteenth Amendment claims and on some of their Fourth Amendment claims.\n\nOn March 18, 2011, the court approved a proposed class settlement.  The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement.  The defendants agreed to pay $1.4 million to class members and roughly $2 million in attorney's fees and costs. The defendants also agreed to pay the two class representatives $25,000 as \"incentive awards\" for serving as the representatives.  However, the defendants later discovered that one of the class representatives had certified that he had no legal claims of any value during bankruptcy proceedings in 2010, so he couldn't receive this incentive award.  The agreed with the defendants and issued an opinion on May 23, 2011.\n\nOver the next two years, the defendants paid claims submitted by class members.  The court oversaw the payments and denied late claims and other challenges.

{"document": "On May 27, 2011, twenty persons then confined in the Suffolk County Correctional Facility (SCCF), which consists of the Riverhead Correctional Facility, a medium/maximum security jail, and the Yaphank Correctional Facility, a minimum security jail, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. The lawsuit was filed pro se as a class action, on behalf of those individuals and all others similarly situated. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages alleging that the conditions of their confinement violated their constitutional rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged unsanitary and hazardous living conditions, including, among other things, chronic exposure to human waste and presence of fungus, mold and other hazardous matters in the shower and housing areas, which caused various ailments to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe plaintiffs all sought to proceed in forma pauperis. The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on June 17, 2011, adding additional eight plaintiffs detained in the SCCF.  The Court (Judge Joanna Seybert), on June 23, 2011, granted the forma pauperis status, but denied the request to proceed as a class action due to the fact that all of the class representatives were proceeding without counsel. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to join four additional plaintiffs on June 30, 2011. On July 27, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a Supplemental Amended Complaint seeking to add seven additional plaintiffs as Supplemental Plaintiffs. The motion for joinder was granted by the order of the Court (Judge Joanna Seybert) on October 7, 2011, but the Court denied the motion to join Supplemental Plaintiffs. The Court also dismissed four plaintiffs with the same order. \n\nOn November 22, 2011, the Court (Judge Joanna Seybert) determined that the appointment of pro bono counsel was appropriate and directed the Court's Pro Se Office to find willing counsel. Afterwards, the Court received a large number of substantially similar complaints from inmates at SCCF, seeking damages, amounting to fifty-nine separate complaints alleging similar violations due to unsanitary conditions. On January 23, 2012, the Court (Judge Joanna Seybert) appointed Shearman & Sterling LLP as pro bono counsel, and ordered consolidation of all existing fifty-nine actions as well as any future complaints of the living conditions at SCCF with Shearman & Sterling's appointment extended to all of the plaintiffs in the newly consolidated action. By April 5, 2012, there were 163 plaintiffs. \n\nOn April 5, 2012, the pro bono counsel filed the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, dropping all plaintiffs but for the named six plaintiffs, but seeking to represent the interests of all 163 plaintiffs, as well as other past, present or future persons imprisoned at SCCF, by proceeding as a class action, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The New York Civil Liberties Union joined in the representation. The complaint was filed against Suffolk County, the Sheriff of the Suffolk County and his deputies in their personal and official capacities. The plaintiffs alleged violations of constitutional rights, negligence and ministerial negligence under New York common law. The allegations included, among other things, overcrowding, and unsanitary and hazardous conditions at the jail-- including flawed plumbing that leads to chronic exposure to human waste and contaminated food and drinking water, which caused the prisoners various health issues. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages. \n\nOn May 16, 2012, the County moved to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint. On May 17, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On March 19, 2013, the Court (Judge Joanna Seybert) addressed both motions. The Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss, dismissing without prejudice claims against the Sheriff and his deputies of personal liability for cruel and inhuman treatment. The Court explained that for such liability to exist, the plaintiffs must demonstrate the defendants' actual knowledge of substantial risk of serious harm, while the complaint pleaded only constructive knowledge. The claim under the theory of supervisory liability against the Sheriff and his deputies was also dismissed, because the complaint was void of any allegations that the defendants made the decisions that allegedly constituted the violations. All other claims survived. The Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, creating two classes, injunctive and damages, constituted of all persons who are at present time or will at any time in the future be detained at SCCF, with separate subclasses for those persons detained at Riverhead and Yaphank, with the named plaintiffs ordered to be the class representatives. The counsel of the named plaintiffs was ordered to be appointed class counsel.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2019, the parties conducted discovery and filed respective motions for summary judgment in fall 2018.

The plaintiff sued the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services (“DCS”) and its Commissioner, the Director of the Facility, an officer of the Facility, and Rutherford County under 42 U.S.C. §1983. The plaintiff, through private counsel and the ACLU of Tennessee claimed violations of the Eighth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The plaintiff alleged the government had unlawfully held him in solitary confinement for long periods of time as a punitive measure. Specifically, the plaintiff was placed in solitary confinement at the Facility for five days prior to the filing of this lawsuit for allegedly disruptive behavior.

{"document": "[Note: This case was previously known as Twitter v. Holder, then Twitter v. Lynch, then Twitter v. Sessions] \n\nOn October 7, 2014, Twitter -- an online social networking service -- filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under the Administrative Procedure Act. Twitter, represented by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, alleging that nondisclosure provisions set forth in a letter from the Deputy Attorney General (\"the DAG Letter\") and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) secrecy provisions were unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Twitter also contended that the review mechanisms for seeking to modify the nondisclosure provisions violate the separation of power principles.\n\nTwitter specifically contested the FBI's practice of occasionally issuing National Security Letters (\"NSLs\") to communication providers, compelling them to disclose information deemed relevant for protecting against terrorism. The FBI also issues FISA orders that permit surveillance or disclosure of stored records. Recipients of a NSL or a FISA order are restricted from disclosing information from that order.\n\nIn 2013, in response to these restrictions, five communication providers (including Google and Facebook) filed a lawsuit to relax restrictions for publishing information such as the total number of requests and user accounts encompassed by such requests. In January 2014, the DOJ and the five providers settled.  Two pre-approved disclosure formats were set forth in the DAG Letter, which was dated January 27, 2014.\n\nTwitter, the plaintiff in this case, had a practice of releasing transparency reports that listed the number of requests from the government for account information and content removal, and how Twitter responded to such requests. At the time of the complaint, the reports did not contain information regarding NSL and FISA orders. On January 29, 2014, the plaintiff met with the defendants and sought confirmation that the DAG Letter (of January 27, 2014) did not apply to the plaintiff. Subsequently, the plaintiff submitted a draft report to the FBI seeking prepublication review; the draft included numeric information of NSL and FISA orders received. The FBI denied prepublication on a basis that the contained information exceeded the scope set forth in the DAG Letter. This first amendment complaint ensued.  \n\nOn October 17, 2014, the government declined to proceed before a magistrate judge, and the case was subsequently reassigned to District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on October 20, 2014.\n\nOn January 9, 2015, the government filed a partial motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The government argued that: 1. The court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs failed to establish an injury-in-fact and therefore lacked standing, and because the DAG Letter did not constitute a final agency act under the Administrative Procedure Act; 2. FISA challenges should instead have been considered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court; and 3. The Plaintiff's separation of powers challenge to the disclosure review mechanisms failed as a matter of law because deference to the Executive was entirely appropriate in this context.  \n\nIn February 2015, a number of popular digital media organizations filed amici briefs on behalf of Twitter, including Buzzfeed, National Public Radio, and Reddit. \n\nA hearing was held on the government’s motion to dismiss on May 5, 2015, but before Judge Rogers could rule, the defendants notified her in June 2015 of the passage of the USA Freedom Act. The USA Freedom Act reauthorized portions of the USA Patriot Act, but eliminated the Patriot Act’s bulk data collection provisions.  Notably for this case, the Act added options for those who had been subject to NSL or FISA orders to publicly report information about orders received, and amended the judicial review process for NSL nondisclosure requirements.\n\nJudge Rogers subsequently called for briefings on the impact of the Act on the pending partial motion for summary judgment and on the case as a whole. The plaintiff argued that the legislative changes did not affect the defendant's pending partial motion to dismiss, should not affect Twitter’s APA or First Amendment claims, and changed, but did not moot, its First Amendment and separation of powers claim. The government argued that passage of the Act made the plaintiff's Administrative Procedure Act and First Amendment challenges moot, and that the Act reinforced the constitutionality of the NSL statutes. \n\nOn October 14, 2015, after receiving all supplemental briefs, the Judge Rogers dismissed the government’s motion to dismiss as moot and ordered Twitter to file an amended complaint in light of the changes under the USA Freedom Act. 139 F.Supp.3d 1075. Twitter filed its amended complaint on November 13, 2015. In light of the new legislation, Twitter sought declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction, arguing that the non-disclosure provisions of FISA were unconstitutional on their face, that the government’s actions showed a pattern of “informal, overly expansive, delayed and conflicting” actions that had a chilling effect on speech and limited Twitter’s first amendment rights. It also argued that the Espionage Act was unconstitutional as applied to Twitter, and sought declaratory relief to that effect, expressing its concern that Twitter would be prosecuted under the Espionage Act should it choose to publish its Transparency Report.\n\nThe government filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on January 15, 2016. It argued that the court should dismiss the FISA claims in the interest of comity, that Twitter failed to establish standing with respect to its Espionage Act claims, and that all of Twitter’s claims should fail as a matter of law since the government may lawfully restrict disclosure of classified information.\n\nOn May 2, 2016, Judge Rogers granted the motion in part and denied it in part. Judge Rogers denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds of comity and concluded that Twitter had standing under the Espionage Act, but had not sufficiently pleaded its First Amendment claims. 183 F.Supp.3d 1007. Three weeks later, Twitter filed a second amended complaint. In it, Twitter alleged an implied cause of action under the First Amendment and a cause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act. Twitter claimed that the information it sought to disclose was improperly classified, and that the government failed to specify which specific information in its report could not be published. \n\nOn November 22, 2016, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. It was denied without prejudice on July 6, 2017. The government filed a motion to reconsider on September 5, 2017, which Judge Rogers denied on November 28, 2017. \n\nAfter a lengthy discovery process, the Court published an order on June 21, 2019 suggesting that they would reconsider defendants' motion for summary judgment based on new information provided in the classified declaration of Michael McGarrity, Acting Executive Assistant Director of the National Security Branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This evidence supported the government's assertion of a state secrets privilege, showing with specificity the imminent harm to national security that disclosure of this information would constitute. \n\nOn September 27, 2019, the government filed a renewed motion for Summary Judgment. On October 25, 2019, plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for Summary Judgment, contending that the government's evidence was purely speculative and hypothetical and that they failed to meet their burden to justify classification of the information in Twitter's transparency report. \n\nIn April 2020, Judge Rogers granted summary judgment to the government and denied summary judgment to the plaintiff. The Court ruled that, while strict scrutiny applied, the government sufficiently showed that the national security concerns outweighed Twitter's interest in disclosure. 2020 WL 1904597.

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and Lambda Legal, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief and a review of administrative action, alleging an equal protection violation. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) violates the Fifth Amendment by refusing to recognize lawful same-sex marriages for purposes of the laws governing spousal health benefits for federal employees, thereby denying her of a benefit that would be available to her if her spouse were of the opposite sex.\n\nThe plaintiff, a 19-year employee of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, had applied for health benefits for her wife and been denied, and though the Ninth Circuit (Chief Judge Alex Kozinski) then issued an order as part of the employment dispute procedure finding that she was entitled to spousal health benefits, In re Golinski, 587 F.3d 901 (9th Cir. 2009), the OPM had refused to comply. As such, the plaintiff's initial complaint requested a writ of mandamus to enforce the Ninth Circuit order. On March 16, 2011, however, the District Court (Judge Jeffrey S. White) dismissed this claim, finding that it lacked jurisdiction to issue mandamus relief, Golinski v. U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 781 F. Supp. 2d 967 (N.D.

The plaintiffs claimed that these policies, which erect barriers to receiving long-term care and arbitrarily restrict the availability of community-based services, violate the Americans with Disabilities Act's integration mandate (under the precedent of Olmstead v. L.C.) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The plaintiffs filed this complaint in response to the failure of D.C. to develop and implement a working Olmstead plan. \n\nOn April 27, 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The defendants claimed that D.C.'s policies were adequate to prevent unnecessary institutionalization and that none of the plaintiffs had demonstrated that his or her institutionalization was a result of the District's policies or that he or she could live in the community. The United States (Department of Justice) filed a brief siding with the plaintiffs on October 3, 2011.  \n\nOn February 14, 2010, Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle issued an opinion denying, for the most part, the defendant's summary judgment motion. Judge Huvelle agreed to dismiss the individual defendant officials from the case, noting that the claims against them were duplicative of those against the District. But, Judge Huvelle denied the defendants' motion on the substantive claims, finding that the District had no effective plan in place to prevent unnecessary institutionalization. In April 2012, the District of Columbia announced a new Olmstead community integration plan.  \n\nIn March of 2013, the plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint without the named parties.

{"document": "On October 9, 2007, a same-sex couple residing in San Diego, California, with their adopted child who was born in Louisiana, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the State of Louisiana. The plaintiffs had asked Louisiana to issue a new original birth certificate identifying plaintiffs as the child's legal parents, but the state refused to do so.  The plaintiffs, represented by Lambda Legal and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory relief finding Louisiana's actions in violation of the Constitution; for an injunction requiring Louisiana to issue the new birth certificate; and for reasonable attorneys' fees.  Plaintiffs amended the complaint on June 30, 2008. \n\nPlaintiffs had adopted their child, who was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in New York in 2006.  Louisiana rejected their request for an amended birth certificate identifying both of them as the child's legal parents relying on its own law, public policy, and an advisory opinion from the Louisiana Attorney General's Office; the state concluded that it was not required to recognize an out-of-state adoption decree that violates Louisiana public policy.  In particular, the state contended that it did not need to recognize out-of-state adoption decrees that name two unmarried persons as the adoptive parents because, in Louisiana, only married parents could jointly adopt a child. \n\nPlaintiffs countered that adoption orders by a New York state court are judgments that must be given full faith and credit under the Constitution by every other state. Furthermore, plaintiffs claimed that the State of Louisiana violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause because the state denied the legal benefit of an accurate birth certificate to a subset of children who are adopted by unmarried same-sex couples.   \n\nOn December 22, 2008, the District Court (Judge Jay C. Zainey) granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment; the court found that the Louisiana statute in question authorizes the state registrar to issue a new birth record upon receipt of a valid out-of-state adoption decree and is entitled to full faith and credit. Thus, the court ordered the state to issue an amended birth certificate identifying the plaintiffs as the child's parents.  On January 15, 2009, the state sought a new trial in the district court and, six days later, also filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \n\nOn March 18, 2009, the District Court denied the state's motion for a new trial and granted the plaintiffs' motion to enforce the judgment; Judge Zainey ordered that the Louisiana State Registrar issue a completed birth certificate reflecting the names of the adoptive parents in accordance with the Court's judgment.  However, on March 27, 2009, the Fifth Circuit ordered that the judgment be stayed pending resolution of defendant's appeal in that Court.  \n\nOn February 18, 2010, a Fifth Circuit panel held that Louisiana law, properly understood, required defendant to reissue the birth certificate with both parents' names listed.

Smith, 622 F.3d 426 (5th Cir. 2010).\n\nOn April 12, 2011, the en banc Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded the case for dismissal. Adar v. Smith, 639 F.3d 146 (5th Cir. 2011). The court found that Louisiana did not violate the full faith and credit clause by determining how to apply its own laws to maintain its vital statistics records, and that no right created by the New York adoption order had been denied. As to the Equal Protection claim, the court found that Louisiana's preference for stable adoptive families provides a rational basis for its decision to have its birth certificate requirements flow from its domestic adoption law (requiring that any parents wishing to jointly adopt be married). The costs on appeal were awarded to defendant as well. \n\nOn May 20, 2011, on remand, the District Court Judge Zainey entered judgment in favor of defendant and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint.

They also claimed that the laws interfered with the structure of their families because same-sex couples could not participate in second parent adoption.\n\nOn June 2, 2014, the Court (Magistrate Judge Joi Elizabeth Peake) granted a petition that allowed one of the plaintiffs to prosecute this civil action on behalf of her minor child. That same day, the Court stayed further proceedings in this case pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12807\"><i>Bostic v.

On October 8, 2014, Judge Osteen lifted the stay in the case and denied all prior pending motions, except the motion for preliminary injunction, as moot. The order also dismissed the North Carolina Attorney General as a defendant and allowed the State of North Carolina to intervene. The plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings that same day.\n\nThe Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate filed motions to intervene. On October 14, 2014, Judge Osteen permitted their intervention, noting that it would preserve their right to appeal, but overruled their objections to the court's jurisdiction and to the application of <i>Bostic</i>.\n\nIn an October 14, 2014 order, the court declared North Carolina Const. art. XIV,\n§ 6, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 51-1, and N.C. Gen. Stat. § 51-1.2 unconstitutional to the extent that those laws prevent same-sex couples from marrying and prohibit the State of North Carolina from recognizing same-sex couples’ lawful out-of-state marriages. 14 F. Supp. 3d 695 (M.D. NC 2014). The order enjoined the State of North Carolina and its officers, agents, and employees from implementing or enforcing any of the above-mentioned provisions. The plaintiffs' claims concerning North Carolina's adoption laws, as well as the pending motion for preliminary injunction, were dismissed without prejudice as moot.\n\nSpeaker of the NC House of Representatives and President Tempore of the NC Senate, intervenors in this action, appealed the order on November 6, 2014. The plaintiffs filed a notice of cross-appeal on November 14, 2014, seeking dismissal of the legislative intervenors' appeal by appealing the order granting the motion for intervention.\n\nOn December 4, 2015, the cross appeals were consolidated before the Fourth Circuit.

This denial left intact the judgment in the plaintiffs' favor of October 8, 2014, rendering the plaintiffs the prevailing party for purposes of recovering attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for attorney's fees on October 13, 2015.

The Plaintiffs alleged that Defendant’s refusal to treat same-sex spouses the same as opposite-sex spouses in the issuance of birth certificates is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Plaintiffs further alleged that the Defendant’s refusal to name both Plaintiffs on their twins’ birth certificates discriminates on the basis of sex and sexual orientation.\n\nThe Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on May 31, 2016. They alleged that there was no dispute between the parties as to material fact and that the Defendants failed to contest the Plaintiffs’ constitutional arguments or right to declaratory relief judgment.

They alleged that the defendants violated the Due Process Clause by subjecting the plaintiffs to fundamentally unfair and procedurally flawed parole review proceedings, and requested injunctive and declaratory relief.\n\nThe suit was brought on behalf of all parolees in the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections facing parole revocation. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the PRB and DOC failed to: <ul><li>appoint counsel to represent indigent parolees in revocation hearings; <li>provide adequate written notice of allegations and evidence against parolees;<li>allow parolees to develop evidence in advance of their hearings;<li>allow parolees the opportunity to speak on their own behalf at hearings;<li>allow parolees to access legal materials required for meaningful participation;<li>allow parolees to present written evidence and witnesses at hearings;<li>provide a hearing before a fair and impartial decision maker;<li>allow parolees to remain silent during proceedings; and<li>allow parolees to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses at the preliminary and final hearing.</ul>The plaintiffs alleged that the process of the parole revocation proceedings amounted to essentially a rubber stamp of the recommendations of supervising parole agents.\n\nShortly after filing, the parties began extensive settlement negotiations and the court stayed discovery. In February 2015, the parties reached an impasse in their negotiations and requested that the stay on discovery be lifted. Then the parties engaged in significant discovery. In February 2016, the parties reengaged in settlement talks, which resulted in a first proposed settlement agreement filed on October 24, 2016. Judge Amy St. Eve granted the parties joint motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and then the parties proceeded to collect comments and objections from class members. \n\nOn January 13, 2017, the plaintiffs informed the court that they had a final settlement agreement and submitted to the court for approval. On January 25, 2017, Judge Amy J. St. Eve granted final approval of a class action settlement agreement and dismissed the case with prejudice.

Counsel would be paid by the PRB, or the PRB would arrange to secure volunteer private counsel and supervised law students who would serve pro bono.\n\nThe parties stipulated that the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center would create a handbook of legal resources and information that the defendants would distribute to all parolees. The IDOC agreed to make its best efforts to provide those in its custody facing parole revocation hearings for offenses in its facilities with access to means of communicating with others who would be able to provide relevant eyewitness or character testimony or other evidence.\n\nThe parties jointly selected a monitor to ensure that the defendant complied with the agreement and was assigned to report to the parties on the status of compliance. In this role, the monitor met with parolees, observed hearings, and examined IDOC and PRB records to determine if the defendants were in compliance with the agreement. The defendants also agreed to pay plaintiffs counsel $225,000 for compensation. The monitor was scheduled to file a report with the parties after one year and then every six months after. The settlement was set to terminate in 24 months from the date of approval, on January 25, 2019. \n\nAs of March 21, 2019, there was no additional activity on this case. This case is now closed.

{"document": "On March 8, 2018 a transgender woman serving a ten-year sentence brought this lawsuit against the Illinois Department of Corrections and a group of its officers in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Though she had lived as a woman since the age of five, the plaintiff was incarcerated in a men’s prison and had previously been transferred from another men’s prison due to harassment and abuse by guards and prisoners. Following a settlement in a related case, the plaintiff continued to be harassed and subjected to physical and sexual abuse. As a result, she was placed in segregation and made multiple suicide attempts. In addition to continued abuse, the defendants allegedly failed to provide basic mental health services to the plaintiff. Officers also allegedly physically assaulted her and made clear that they would not protect her from other inmates. \n\nThe complaint and an accompanying motion for preliminary injunction asked the court to order the defendants to transfer the plaintiff to a women’s prison. The plaintiff also sought:\n1) an injunction under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which would require adequate mental health care and placement in general population rather than segregation; \n2) a declaration that the defendants’ conduct and policies violated the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments and the Illinois Hate Crimes Act;\n3) compensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and\n4) attorney fees. \nThe case was assigned to Judge Nancy J. Rosenstengel. On April 20, 2018, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, asking the court to dismiss the suit because the plaintiff had yet to “exhaust <i> his </i> administrative remedies” (emphasis added) as required by the PLRA for actions brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to follow procedure or provide sufficient information for the grievances that were filed, and in other cases failed to file a grievance for particular claims.\n\nOn June 8, 2018, the plaintiff moved to withdraw her motion for a preliminary injunction, informing the court the she had been transferred to a new men’s prison facility due to her fear for her life from ongoing abuse. There, she was placed in general population and received some mental health services, seeming to moot the request for preliminary relief. However, on July 17, 2018, barely a month later, the plaintiff filed a renewed motion for preliminary injunction, arguing that as soon as her prior injunctive motion had been withdrawn, prison staff had resumed discriminatory treatment against her, including verbal abuse and a failure to ensure her physical safety from other inmates and prison staff. On August 14, 2018, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint reflecting these developments.\n\nOn November 7, 2018, Judge Rosenstengel issued an order granting portions of the preliminary injunction. 2018 WL 5830730. The order emphasized that since her childhood, the plaintiff's \"family and community treated her as a girl and referred to her by her preferred name.” Judge Rosenstengel also noted that the plaintiff had begun \"hormone treatment to physically transition to female” which was “most likely irreversible.” The court held that the plaintiff had a likelihood of success as to her equal protection claims and her Eighth Amendment claims. It ordered the defendants to train staff on transgender issues, allow the plaintiff to attend transgender support group programs, and consider all evidence for and against transferring the plaintiff to a women’s facility. The injunction gave the defendants fourteen days to comply. \n\nMagistrate Judge Reona Daly documented a report and recommendations pertaining to the defendant's motion for summary judgment. 2019 WL 3046332. The report granted the defendant's motion for some claims, finding that the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative options. For nine other claims, though, the Magistrate Judge recommended denying the defendant's summary judgment motion because the facts supported the plaintiff's assertion that she had exhausted her administrative options. Because neither party objected to the report, Judge Rosenstengel reviewed the report only for clear error. Finding none, she adopted the recommendations on May 15, 2019. 2019 WL 2118219. The claims dismissed were dismissed without prejudice, and the surviving claims proceeded.\n\nOn July 8, 2019, the plaintiff was transferred out of Illinois Department of Corrections. Shortly thereafter, on July 25, two defendants associated with Illinois Department of Corrections moved to dismiss claims against them seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. The two defendants argued that the plaintiff's transfer mooted those claims. After the plaintiffs did not respond to the motion, Judge Rosenstengel dismissed the claims on February 6, 2020. 2020 WL 584193. After this motion, the five surviving claims were: three Eighth Amendment claims, a claim arising under the Illinois Hate Crimes Act, and an IIED claim.\n\nAs of April 13, 2020, the parties were engaged in discovery and the case was ongoing.", "summary": "A transgender woman incarcerated at a men's prison in Illinois brought this action against the Illinois Department of Corrections and its officers in federal court, for abuse, harassment, and equal protection violations.

{"document": "This case addresses the Illinois Department of Corrections’ treatment of a prisoner during two decades of solitary confinement. \n\nInitially, the prisoner had been sentenced to serve seven years in prison as a young adult. However, during his first years in prison, he accumulated infractions for violent behavior caused by an untreated personality disorder. As a result, his sentence was extended to almost two lifetimes in solitary confinement.  Released in August 2018 as the result of a habeas petition (one of more than 3 dozen federal lawsuits he filed challenging his confinement), he filed this lawsuit against the State of Illinois and its Department of Corrections on October 28, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Represented by Loevy & Loevy, the MacArthur Justice Center, and private counsel, he brought claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act.  Under §1983 he alleged that the Department had violated his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and he claimed that the Department discriminated against him by its failure to provide treatment or reasonable accommodations in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.  He sought compensatory, punitive, and nominal damages and attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint outlined the conditions he faced while in solitary confinement. The plaintiff alleged the Department did not provide him with any way to challenge his placement in solitary confinement. He spent twenty years in a cell the size of half a parking space with no sensory stimulation or human contact. Throughout the twenty years, the prison recorded dozens of instances of the plaintiff engaging in serious self-mutilation and increasingly aggressive behavior; he alleged that he was never given the acute psychiatric care he needed for his declining mental health. \n\nInitially assigned to Judge Sara L. Ellis, the case was transferred on March 27, 2019 to the Central District of Illinois, where it was assigned to Judge Colin Stirling Bruce.

Baker.\n\nTwo days prior to his recusal, Judge Bruce denied the Department’s motion to dismiss; however, he dismissed the State of Illinois as a defendant, even though no such dismissal had been sought.  He stated that because Illinois accepts federal funding, it does not enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity from suits brought under the Rehabilitation Act.  However, because the Director of the Department of Corrections was sued in his official capacity (which is equivalent to a suit against the state itself), the state’s participation in the lawsuit would be unnecessary.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an amended complaint on March 7, 2020.

The complaint challenged the creation of housing units inside federal prisons in which prisoners lived in isolation from the outside world.

For example, the Department had not made all parts of their facilities wheelchair-accessible, forcing wheelchair-bound prisoners to expose themselves to dangerous conditions likely to cause physical harm, such as noncompliant bathrooms, showers, ramps, and cells. The Department had also denied the plaintiffs and other disabled prisoners equal access to the Department's vocational training and work release programs on the sole basis of their disabilities, resulting in lost opportunities to work and earn money while in prison.

{"document": "This is a case about poor conditions at a North Carolina private prison. On June 28, 2007, a group of men held at the Rivers Correctional Institution in North Carolina brought this class action suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. They sued GEO Group, Inc., the private company that owned and operated the prison, and the United States Federal Bureau of Prisons. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, the Legal Aid Justice Center, and the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, sought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief, claiming statutory violations under the Rehabilitation Act, violations of the Eighth Amendment, and negligence. \n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the health and welfare of the class, that they had excluded prisoners with disabilities from other services and programs, and that they had deliberately deprived the plaintiffs of adequate medical, dental, and mental health care. For example, the named plaintiff suffered improper treatment of a cavity at Rivers and ultimately underwent emergency surgery, which removed the infection and saved his life but left him deformed and disabled. The plaintiffs also alleged that GEO Group had breached its contract with the U.S. Government, which required GEO Group to provide its prisoners with “medical services that are commensurate with community standards.”\n\nOn July 26, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and, in the alternative, to transfer the case on the grounds that the D.C. Court lacked personal jurisdiction over GEO Group. On September 18, 2007, the United States Bureau of Prisons also filed a motion to dismiss or transfer. The plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on September 25, 2007. Both parties filed motions for time extensions to file responses to the motions, but on February 28, 2008, Judge Ricardo M. Urbina, agreeing that “transferring the case furthers the interests of justice,” granted the defendants’ motion to transfer the case to the Eastern District of North Carolina. 535 F. Supp. 2d 83 (D.D.C. 2008). The case was then transferred to North Carolina, where it was assigned to Senior District Judge Malcolm J. Howard. \n\nOn October 24, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, stipulating the requests for both the class and the Disability Sub-Class (which consisted of prisoners who had been allegedly denied access to programs and services they should have been provided under the Rehabilitation Act) and demanding a jury trial. The defendants moved to strike the amended complaint on January 5, 2009, and simultaneously filed motions to dismiss the suit. On February 16, 2009, GEO Group filed a notice of subsequently decided authority, citing Judge James C. Dever’s February 13, 2009 decision dismissing a prisoner's claims to relief for failure to comply with North Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 9(j), regarding special pleading requirements for medical malpractice. The Bureau of Prisons also filed a notice of subsequently decided authority on April 14, 2009, noting that the Fourth Circuit had affirmed a district court’s finding that the Rehabilitation Act did not apply to federal prisons. \n\nThe case was reassigned from Judge Howard to Judge James C. Dever on July 22, 2008, and Judge Dever issued three orders: denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss and their motion to strike the amended complaint, and denying without prejudice the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On November 9, 2009, Judge Dever granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss because two of the named plaintiffs had been released and for failure to state a claim, granting the plaintiffs leave to re-file an amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 9, 2009, which the defendants moved to dismiss on January 22, 2010. After a hearing on the motions conducted on January 31, the Federal Bureau of Prisons filed a motion to dismiss on February 2. \n\nOn September 29, 2010, Judge Dever granted GEO Group’s motion to dismiss and granted in part the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ motion to dismiss, largely because the plaintiffs still failed to state a claim; however, the judge gave the plaintiffs leave to file a third amended complaint. 2010 WL 3835141. \n\nThe plaintiffs accordingly filed a third amended complaint on October 25, 2010. The plaintiffs continued to allege that GEO Group “manifested a pervasive and deliberate indifference to the health needs of” the prisoners at Rivers. The complaint described ten separate prisoners who had suffered deprivation of medical care or inadequate medical care while at Rivers and who had suffered injury, hospitalization, or disability as a result. \n\nGEO Group filed an unopposed motion to dismiss GEO Group as a defendant on November 29, 2010, noting that the Court had stated that it would dismiss the claims in the Third Amended Complaint as to GEO. The Bureau of Prisons filed a motion to dismiss on December 3, 2010. \n\nOn July 18, 2011, Judge Dever granted GEO Group’s motion to dismiss as a defendant, citing the November 9, 2009 motion to dismiss, in which GEO argued that GEO’s actions at Rivers did not qualify as government action against which Eighth Amendment claims could be raised. However, the court rejected the Bureau of Prison’s argument that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies because the Bureau failed to adequately support their argument with evidence. 2011 WL 2899135. \n\nThe plaintiffs again attempted to file for class certification on August 23, 2011, against which the Bureau of Prisons filed a motion to stay while they filed a motion to dismiss one of the plaintiffs.

The Third Circuit’s decision hinged on two elements, including whether the plaintiff’s criminal complaint was brought without probable cause and whether the defendant acted maliciously toward the plaintiff.

That fall and into early 2019, the parties continued settlement negotiations without success. In May of 2019, the case was re-assigned to Judge John Michael Vazquez. Later that year, the plaintiff filed a motion for recusal, which was denied by Judge Vazquez.\n\nOn February 7, 2020, the plaintiff requested to stay the case while the Third Circuit decided a petition for a writ of mandamus.

The plaintiff, represented by private attorneys, sought $460,000 in damages, claiming that there was a failure by the prison system to communicate with him since the beginning of his sentence in late 2000 (14 years). The lawsuit claimed that, instead of providing interpreters, the prison made him train other inmates as his interpreters and that they were not qualified to help him.

DRN alleged that the PDOC violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment in its use of solitary confinement \"Restrictive Housing Units\" (RHUs). There are no prisoner plaintiffs, and the case is not a class action; DRN has been designated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as an entity that can advocate for and protect the rights of Pennsylvanians with mental illness, pursuant to the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-07.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections violated the rights of prisoners with severe mental illness by creating a cycle of solitary confinement and mental deterioration through the use of RHUs.  DRN alleged that the PDOC regularly disciplined mentally ill prisoners for behavior symptomatic of their mental illnesses, and failed to take account of the role of mental illness in their behavior and the particularly detrimental effect of solitary confinement on the mentally ill, whose conditions worsened when deprived of human contact and adequate treatment. DRN further alleged that the PDOC did not maintain adequate therapeutic alternatives to RHUs for the number of mentally ill prisoners in the system and that PDOC nevertheless underutilized the treatment facilities it had by placing mentally ill prisoners in solitary confinement, even when there were significant numbers of beds available in appropriate treatment programs.\n\nOn January 5, 2015, the parties executed a <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PC-PA-0031-0003.pdf\">Settlement Agreement</a> providing for the dismissal of the matter without prejudice and retention of limited jurisdiction by the Court to enforce the agreement.

Plaintiffs challenged the Board's denials of parole for prisoners convicted of violent offenses solely because of the nature and circumstances of the crimes they had been convicted of committing. Those denials, Plaintiffs said, violated their due process rights and were unconstitutional ex post facto enhancements of their sentences. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. \n\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs claimed that the Board adopted and implemented practices, policies, and procedures for making parole determinations without considering all the circumstances required by Virginia law, resulting in a drastic reduction in the availability of parole for prisoners convicted of violent offenses and the de facto abolition of the provisions of Virginia law governing parole for such prisoners. Moreover, Plaintiffs claimed these practices, policies and procedures created a significant risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to their crimes at the time of sentencing. \n\nPlaintiffs brought this action on behalf of a class of persons currently incarcerated by the Virginia Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") for violent offenses committed prior to January 1, 1995, who were or would become eligible for parole, and who had been or were likely to be denied parole exclusively or primarily by reference to the serious nature or circumstances of the crimes they had been convicted of committing. \n\nOn March 1, 2010, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss. On October 25, 2010, the Court (Judge Robert E. Payne) denied discovery and dismissed the case with prejudice. Judge Payne held that Plaintiffs had only a limited liberty interest in parole that was satisfied by existing prison procedures, noting that \"the Board has provided each Plaintiff with a constitutionally valid reason for denying them release on discretionary parole.\" In addition, Judge Payne rejected the ex post facto claims because the complaint revealed that about 120 to 230 prisoners who had been convicted of committing violent crimes were released on parole each year.  \n\nOn November 22, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Alter Judgment Pursuant to Rule 59(e).

Gregory dissented, criticizing the majority's \"rigidly formalistic view\" of due process that allowed the Board to discharge its duties by supplying Plaintiffs written reasons for parole denials without requiring individualized consideration. \n\nPlaintiffs petitioned for a rehearing, but this was denied on November 15, 2012.

The plaintiffs stated that they were peacefully protesting police brutality and institutionalized racism when San Jose police fired impact munitions and attacked them with flash-bang grenades, chemical weapons, and batons. The plaintiffs contended that the defendants have exhibited a long history of targeting Black, Brown, and Muslim communities, and that the use of force in these protests was racially motivated. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, contending that the defendants violated their First Amendment right to free speech and association, their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful arrest and excessive force, and their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection. Claims were also brought under the state constitution equivalents of these provisions. The plaintiffs also brought claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, arguing that the defendant's policing practices failed to make reasonable modifications that allow people with disabilities to participate in protests. Finally, the plaintiffs sued under a variety of state laws, including tort claims like assault and negligence. The lawsuit sought declaratory relief stating that the defendant's policing practices were unconstitutional, as well and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from engaging in the same behavior in the future.

The suit was filed by a number of political and legal organizations, as well as a news media organization. These groups included: Black Lives Matter Chicago; Black Abolitionist Network; Chicago Democratic Socialists of America; Good Kids/Mad City; #LetUsBreathe Collective; South Siders Organized for Unity and Liberation; National Lawyers Guild Chicago; First Defense Legal Aid; and In These Times. The defendants were numerous federal agents, including Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, Deputy Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Matthew Albence, Attorney General William Barr, Director of Federal Protective Services L. Eric Patterson, and FBI Director Christopher Wray, among others. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel and attorneys from Westside Justice Center, People's Law Office, as well as attorney-professors at Northwestern and University of Chicago. \n\nThe lawsuit followed the dispersal of federal agents to quell protests that occurred in Chicago after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the spring of 2020. President Trump first sent federal agents to Portland in July, then to several other cities including Chicago later that month. The complaint did not allege that the federal troops had done anything in particular, but that their very presence was menacing. They argued that the presence of these federal agents represented violations of the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights to free speech and free protest as well as excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. They also alleged conspiracy to deprive the plaintiffs of their rights. The plaintiffs requested declaratory relief that would deem the federal agents' actions illegal and injunctive relief prohibiting the policing of the protests by federal agents, ceasing the arrest of residents of Chicago, and to stop enforcing a policy of alleged \"preemptive arrests.\"\n\nOn July 31, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint which added a count of violating the Tenth Amendment. They argued that the federal agents' conducting of law enforcement was an encroachment on the policing powers left to the state and local government. \n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to state a claim on October 2. They argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because the plaintiffs' alleged injuries that took place in other cities and statements by the President, Attorney General, and Acting Secretary of DHS, but failed to allege particular and concrete injuries their organizations in Chicago. In addition, even if the plaintiffs had standing, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Tenth Amendment because the plaintiffs did not cite that a specific federal law violated the Tenth Amendment or adequately allege the federal defendants encroached on a specific power reserved to the states.\n\nOn January 21, 2021, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims with prejudice.

{"document": "On May 25, 2010, the plaintiffs -- individuals who were allegedly issued summonses without probable cause by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) -- filed this putative class action complaint in the United States Court for the Southern District of New York, against the City of New York under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, claiming violations of their First and Fourth Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that an unwritten 'summons quota' drove NYPD officers to issue summonses to and arrest individuals without probable cause, and in violation of the federal and state constitutions. \n\nThe complaint explained that in 1994, the NYPD instituted the COMPSTAT system, which records the statistics of arrests by type and the amount of summonses issued. Summonses are tickets written by police officers in lieu of arrest for a crime that directs the recipient of the summons to appear in court to face charges. Marijuana violations, disorderly conduct, and obstruction of governmental administration (OGA) are crimes for which summonses are typically issued. The plaintiffs alleged that since the institution of the COMPSTAT system, the number of summonses issued had increased by 500%, and that more than half (50.5%) of these charges are dismissed later on.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the NYPD employed an illegal quota system for summonses, arrests, and quality-of-life violations. An officer's ability to meet quotas, plaintiffs claimed, was linked to officer promotion and demotion.  This scheme was found by an arbitrator to be illegal under New York labor law.\n\nAs alleged by the plaintiffs, as part of an effort to meet the quota system NYPD Precinct commanders ordered officers to issue summonses in cases in which there was no probable cause of a crime being committed. They introduced tape recordings of two precinct commanders issuing orders for officers to issue summonses and 'articulate' violations of the law after-the-fact. The plaintiffs further alleged that this policy was disproportionately enforced in minority communities in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens.  As a result, they have been falsely arrested and denied their right to peaceably assemble in their own communities.\n\nOn April 23, 2012, after hearing the parties on the matter of class certification, the court (Judge Robert W. Sweet) issued an unpublished opinion and order certifying the class as \"includ[ing] individuals who were issued summonses that were later dismissed upon a judicial finding of facial insufficiency and who were ticketed without probable cause.\"  The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration on the issue of class certification, but the motion was denied on July 19, 2012. \n\nFor the next several years, the parties engaged in discovery and litigated many issues regarding access to evidence during discovery. One notable discovery debate concerned removing the statutory seal on the records of individuals whose criminal court summonses were dismissed for factual insufficiency for the relevant time period. On February 24, 2016, the court (Judge Sweet) issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part defendants’ second motion to remove the statutory seal, concluding that unsealing the records for the purpose of aggregating statistics and discerning patterns is permissible, but doing so to identify officers who issued disputed summonses so that they can be called at trial is not. 2016 WL 817445. On April 1, 2016, the court (Judge Sweet) issued an order detailing the summons information to be provided and that which was to be withheld.\n\nOn January 23, 2017, the plaintiffs submitted an executed stipulation of settlement and a proposed preliminary approval order. On January 24, 2017, the court (Judge Sweet) issued an order granting preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and notice plan, and appointing a settlement claims administrator.\n\nThe parties agreed to settlement benefits of up to seventy-five million dollars, with up to $56,500,000 to be used to fund settlement payments to individual class members, service awards to the named class representatives, and costs of notice and settlement administration, and an additional $18,500,000 to pay attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nAs is detailed in the settlement, the NYPD has made changes to its policies, practices, and procedures related to criminal summonses, and will continue to make additional changes. The changes address the use of quotas, numerical measurements of performance, and other matters that have been the subject of the class’ injunctive relief claims in this case, including: signing into law the Quota Bill to prohibit discrimination against an employee for the failure to meet quotas; publishing Legal Bureau Bulletin concerning the Quota Bill; revising Patrol Guide Section 205-38 to reiterate the retaliating against service members for providing information regarding misconduct and corruption will not be tolerated; developing new Patrol Guide procedures and updating training and reference materials; announcing the “Justice Reboot” initiative; signing the Criminal Justice Reform Act (singed by Mayor de Blasio); voluntarily posting certain summons data on the NYPD website; and agreeing to make a confidential presentation to counsel for the class regarding changes to the performance evaluation system. \n\nThe NYPD agreed to present additional pilots and ongoing projects. Such pilots and projects include: making reasonable efforts to ensure that the NYPD sends a department-wide email regarding quota policy, disciplinary action, and retaliation; investigating allegations regarding quotas, numeric performance goals, and misconduct; conducting such investigations by a designated parent command Investigations Unit; making reasonable efforts to conduct targeted internal review of training materials and to ensure compliance with the Quota Bill; and making reasonable efforts to make changes to its Patrol Guide and conduct training relating to the distribution of “Contact Cards.”\n\nOn April 14, 2017, the parties jointly moved for final approval of the class action settlement, which the court granted on April 18, 2017. On June 19, 2017, the court entered final judgment in this case, approving the settlement agreement. The judgment, pursuant to the settlement agreement, required the defendants to pay settlement benefits in the amount of $75,000,000 and attorneys’ fees in the amount of $18,500,000. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.

The filing followed a year long DOJ investigation of the SDP.\n\nContemporaneously with the filing of the government's complaint, the parties filed a joint application for the entry of the consent decree.  In support of the joint application, the parties submitted the declaration of James J. Fyfe, Ph.D., a nationally recognized expert in police management, who consulted the DOJ during its investigation of SPD.  District Judge George C. Smith entered the consent decree on September 3, 1997.  The consent decree included the implementation of changes in the use of force, officer training, internal affairs investigations, officer detention and arrest of subjects, and collection and retention of department information and data.\n\nOn October 20, 1997, the Fraternal Order of Police of Fort Steuben filed a motion for leave to intervene as a third-party, so that it could challenge the consent decree. Judge Smith denied that motion on July 23, 1998.\n\nIn accordance with the consent decree, the parties selected Charles D Reynolds to serve as auditor.  The auditor was charged with oversight of the implementation of the provisions of the consent decree and provided quarterly reports to the court.\n\nIn 2001, a member of the police department who had not been chosen as the Chief of Police when that position was being filled sued in state court, alleging a violation of Ohio Civil Service law.  The city defended the case on the grounds that it followed the procedures specified in the consent decree, and the matter was moved to federal court.  On June 15, 2001, Judge Smith found that case (C2-01-322) related to the underlying civil rights case;  both were assigned to Judge Edmund A. Sargus Jr., for decision.  On June 15, 2001, Judge Sargus ordered the cases consolidated, denied the city's dismissal motion, and granted the U.S. permission to intervene as a party in the civil service case.  147 F.Supp.2d 872 (2001).

{"document": "On July 24, 2008, plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, against the City of Tenaha.  The plaintiffs were all individuals who were traveling on public roads in or near Tenaha, Texas, when, they say, they were illegally stopped and their property seized. They sued under the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable searches and seizures) and Fourteenth Amendments (equal protection), actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The plaintiffs were represented by lawyers from Legal Aid, the American Civil Liberties Union (Racial Justice Program, Criminal Law Reform Project, Texas chapter, and national), and from private practice. They asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief as well as monetary relief including compensatory and punitive damages as well as legal costs.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that law enforcement officials in and around the City of Tenaha had developed an illegal practice of targeting, stopping, detaining, searching, and often seizing property from people who appeared to be non-white or who were traveling with non-white passengers.  The named plaintiffs claimed that they had been victims of such stops.  \n\nThe plaintiffs sought a class certification of similarly situated persons consisting of: (1) people who were, or appeared to be, members of racial or ethnic minority groups and those in their company, and (2) were or would be traveling in, through, or near Tenaha since July 27, 2006, and (3) were, or were subject to being stopped and detained and/or arrested by one or more of the defendants without an articulable suspicion of criminal activity, to find valuable property or money. \n\nThe individual plaintiffs were allegedly stopped without warrants or legal justification and were then either detained or threatened with detention, and had property seized in amounts varying from $3,969 to $50,000. Plaintiffs were allegedly falsely prosecuted for crimes such as money laundering. One couple was allegedly told that their children would be put in foster care if they did not sign papers authorizing the seizure.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, the Court (Judge T. John Ward) granted in part the plaintiff's motion for class certification. Morrow v. Washington, 277 F.R.D. 172 (E.D. Tex. 2011). The Court granted the class certification for Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, but did not certify the class for Fourth Amendment search and seizure claims or for monetary relief.  In the opinion, the Court cited to recordings from cameras in the police vehicles at the time of the stops.  The Court drew an adverse inference from the failure of Tenaha's law enforcement agencies to collect and report racial profiling evidence, as required by Texas law.  The Court also drew an adverse inference from two defendants' invocation of their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, during deposition.  The Court modified the class definition, because it found that there was \"articulable suspicion\" for the stops (albeit not reasonable suspicion).  The modified definition of the class consisted of (1) people who were, or appeared to be, members of racial or ethnic minority groups and those in their company, and (2) were, or would be, traveling in, through, or near Tenaha at any time after November 1, 2006, and (3) were subject to being stopped by one or more defendant for an alleged traffic violation. The defendants twice sought a discretionary interlocutory appeal of the class certification, but were twice denied.\n\nOn August 6, 2012, plaintiffs and defendants filed a joint motion for preliminary approval of a consent decree.  The Consent Decree was extensive, with key terms including the following:<ul><li>All traffic stops shall be recorded in full by both video and audio recordings.  \n<li>Defendants shall maintain written documentation with details about traffic stops, detention, canine sniffs, searches, seizures, and/or forfeitures.\n<li>Defendants will not use canines for routine traffic stops.  \n<li>Written notice shall be provided to a person before a canine sniff, before a consent search, and before the seizure of property. Before conducting a consent search, an officer must obtain written and oral video and audio recorded consent for the search.\n<li>Defendants will track all asset forfeiture incident to traffic stops, and all such revenue will all be donated to non-profit organizations, used for audio and video equipment, or used for the annual training required by this decree.\n<li>Internal review procedures will be instituted every quarter, and an impartial monitor will address compliance.</ul> Defendants also agreed to pay litigation costs (attorneys' fees and notice to the class).\n\nOn February 19, 2013, the Court (Judge Gilstrap) granted preliminary approval of the consent decree.  Following a fairness hearing, the court granted final approval of the consent decree on August 8, 2013. The court appointed a monitor on October 9, 2013, who proceeded to file quarterly status reports. \n\nOn August 7, 2017, the plaintiffs moved to extend the duration of the Consent Decree, which was set to expire the next day. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants had a \"poor record of compliance,\" necessitating an extension of the consent decree. There was a hearing on this motion on November 1, 2018, after which the parties renegotiated the settlement agreement. They filed a joint motion to approve the amended agreement on December 13, 2018, which the court approved. The agreement was substantially similar to the originally consent decree, but extended the duration to the next two years with the opportunity for the plaintiffs to file for additional extensions. \n\nThis case is ongoing with some litigation over attorneys' fees as of April 17, 2020.

The political party Alliance Party and two third-party presidential filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on August 21, 2020. They were represented by private counsel and sued the District of Columbia Board of Elections. The case was assigned to Judge Boasberg.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that they had not been given adequate notice of the signature decrease, resulting in them abandoning their effort to collect signatures because they thought it would be impossible to collect 5,0007 signatures while adhering to social distancing guidelines. The deadline for submitting petitions to appear on the ballot had passed the day before the bill was passed on August 6, 2020. Plaintiffs alleged that independent and third-party presidential candidates who ceased attempting to collect signatures to meet the 5,007 threshold had their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights violated because they could not take advantage of the signature reduction until it was too late. \n\nSuing under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiffs contended that their equal protection rights were violated because notice was given to other candidates, but not independent or third-party presidential candidates. The plaintiffs also alleged that their First Amendment and due process rights were violated because they had not been given timely notice to exercise their fundamental right of political speech. In addition to declaratory relief, the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing the new bill, and also sought a deadline extension that would allow presidential candidates to continue gathering signatures until September 1, 2020. For future elections the plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction requiring the defendants to provide at least two-weeks notice for any changes to the signature requirement.

{"document": "On May 15, 2015, private citizens of Jefferson County, Florida filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida.  The plaintiffs sued the Jefferson County Board of Commissioners, as well as the Jefferson County School Board and the official director of elections in the county, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The plaintiffs were represented by two public interest groups, the Florida Justice Institute and the ACLU Foundation of Florida. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to name the 2013 redistricting plan of Jefferson County unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, asking for an order enjoining the use of the 2013 redistricting plan, and, in the event that the defendants were unable to come up with a plan that was satisfactory, a court-ordered redistricting plan. The plaintiffs also sought attorney’s fees.\n\nJefferson County, Florida was divided into five districts, each of which elected one commissioner to the Board of Commissioners. Each voting district was supposed to contain a roughly equal number of residents, pursuant to the one person one vote requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. The third district contained the Jefferson Correctional Institution, a correctional facility housing 1157 inmates (according to the 2010 census). The population of the correctional facility was counted when drawing the lines of District Three, even though the vast majority of the inmates were not residents of Jefferson County, and thus were not registered to vote in Jefferson County. Because there are five districts in Jefferson County, an ideal population size for each district would be 1/5 of the population.  Including the prison population, District 3 missed this goal by only 4%. Not including the prison population, District 3 missed this goal by 29.69%. The plaintiffs were concerned that the smaller voting population in District 3 gave the residents there inflated electing power. \n\nOn March 9th, 2015, the plaintiffs filed their complaint, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. Discovery lasted about two months, from the end of March, 2015 to September of 2015. At the end of July, the Defendants moved for summary judgment, and at the beginning of August, 2015, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment as well.\n\nOn March 19, 2016, Judge Mark E. Walker granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants'. As a result, the 2013 Jefferson County redistricting plan was declared unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and was forbidden from being used. 2016 was an election year for Jefferson County, so the court entreated the Defendant to come up with a usable, constitutional redistricting plan, or the court would be forced to order their own redistricting plan.\n\nBoth the plaintiffs and the defendants then submitted redistricting plans for Jefferson County. The plaintiffs’ plan was only to be accepted if the defendants’ plan was unacceptable. A major point of contention in the acceptability of the plans was their adherence to a 1985 consent decree, which outlined the way elections were to be run in Jefferson County. The sticking point was that the consent decree stipulated that District 3 was to be a “balance district” – that is, having roughly equal numbers of African-American and white voters.\n\nOn April 18, 2016, Judge Mark E. Walker approved the defendants’ plan.  Though the new District 3 did not have an equal number of African-American and white voters, the court deemed it acceptable and no longer unconstitutional. \n\nOn July 13, 2016, the two parties filed a notice of settlement. They resolved the plaintiffs’ claim for attorney’s fees; the amount settled upon was not mentioned in the notice. The parties also agreed to close the case, but asked the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the payment of the settlement.  The settlement was to be made in two payments.

The plaintiffs sued the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC) and multiple state officials associated with the organization under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. With the representation of private counsel and the Federal Public Defenders Office, the plaintiffs claimed violations of the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, and the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants’ lethal injection protocols did not follow the FDA’s regulations and that the Department was concealing information regarding protocols. The plaintiffs sought temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to order defendants to stop executing plaintiffs until they complied with FDA regulations.\n\nOn July 2, 2014, the lead plaintiff, Wood, filed a motion for preliminary injunction to bar defendants from his scheduled execution on July 23, 2014 without first disclosing to him the process of his execution and the drugs to be used. On July 10, 2014, Judge Neil Wake denied the motion on the grounds that Wood’s motion, founded on the First Amendment claim in his complaint, was not likely to succeed on the merits and did not raise serious questions as to the merits. 2014 WL 3385115. Wood appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit. \n\nOn July 19, 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision and ordered that Wood’s execution be stayed until the ADC provided specific information as to the drugs to be used in his execution and the qualifications of the personnel intended to carry out his execution. 759 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2014). ADC immediately filed a petition for a rehearing, but the Ninth Circuit denied the petition on July 21, 2014. The following day, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit’s decision, holding that Judge Wake did not abuse his discretion in denying Wood’s motion for a preliminary injunction. 135 S. Ct. 21 (2014). Mr. Wood was executed on July 23, 2014. \n\nThe remaining plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 18, 2014. The complaint described the defendants’ “improvisational execution” of Wood, stating that it placed “his suffering far beyond what the Constitution permits.” It alleged that he gasped for air for nearly two hours as the defendants continued to inject him with a variety of drugs. The complaint also added new plaintiffs and new claims to the original suit. It added several other citizens and residents of Arizona subject to the death penalty, as well as the First Amendment Coalition of Arizona, Inc. The complaint further alleged that the defendants had denied the press their First Amendment rights to access governmental proceedings, and that they violated the prisoners' rights against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. They also claimed that the defendants had violated the Equal Protection Clause because execution methods varied without a principled basis for such deviations. \n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 9, 2014 for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The defendants moved to dismiss most of the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims alleging violation of their right to governmental proceedings and their Fourteenth Amendment claims. On November 21, 2014, the parties entered a stipulated agreement to resolve this motion. The stipulation set forth the following terms: Arizona would publicly release a report regarding Wood’s execution and, in light of this report, the ADC would review its death penalty procedure and propose a new protocol. If adopted, ADC would provide the plaintiffs with a copy to review and upload the final protocol on the website for public viewing. Regarding the litigation process, the stipulation stated that the defendants would not seek an execution warrant from the Arizona Supreme Court until after the issue was resolved and a final judgment was entered, that all litigation would be stayed until the new protocol was proposed, that the plaintiffs would be allowed to file a second amended complaint after the new protocol was released, if needed, and that the defendants would take appropriate steps to preserve all documents relied upon and used in the report. Both parties agreed to not seek attorneys' fees.\n\nJudge Wake lifted the stay on January 12, 2016, holding that the stipulation had been satisfied but that the state could not seek a warrant of execution until the matters pending in the case were resolved. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on January 29, 2016. This complaint alleged that the new protocol proposed by the defendants used a combination of drugs never used together before and still violated the same rights. The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ entire second amended complaint on February 19, 2016 on the grounds that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On May 18, 2016, Judge Neil Wake granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice as to both the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment claims on the grounds that neither guaranteed a legal right of access to government information. This decision also dismissed the First Amendment Coalition as a plaintiff. 188 F. Supp. 3d 940. First Amendment Coalition appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nMeanwhile in the district court, on July 29, 2016, the defendants filed another motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim of an Eighth Amendment violation for cruel and unusual punishment on the grounds of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The defendants argued that they no longer had the midazolam drug plaintiffs referred to in the complaint and could not no longer obtain it. On December 19, 2016, the parties agreed to dismiss the first claim in the plaintiffs’ second amended complaint without prejudice. But, if the ADC used or showed an intention of using midazolam or any benzodiazepine drug as part of the lethal injection protocol in the future, any future prisoner, as a third-part beneficiary, could reinstate this claim. Neither party sought attorneys' fees but they did agree in the stipulation that plaintiffs were entitled to seek fees if the defendant breached the agreement.\n\nThe final stipulated agreement of the case was entered on June 21, 2017. The agreement dismissed the last two claims in the plaintiffs’ complaint but the parties did not agree to settle. So, the plaintiffs’ preserved the right to appeal any claims in the case. Essentially, the agreement prohibited the defendant from ever engaging in the following conduct: using certain categories of drugs or expired drugs in the lethal injection process, forcing prisoners to pay for the chemicals to be used in their own injection, failing to provide a timely report of the drugs used upon request, changing the drugs to be used in an execution after a warrant has been sought without notifying the prisoner, and adopting any language that would allow the ADC or its directors discretion to deviate from the central issues to the established execution procedures. The agreement stated that if the defendants engaged in or showed an intent to engage in certain prohibited conduct that the claims would be reinstated and the defendants would be enjoined.\n\nFirst Amendment Coalition's appeal continued in the Ninth Circuit. Oral arguments occurred on September 12, 2018. On September 17, 2019, the court released its opinion affirming in part and reversing in part the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’ second amended complaint. The court held that the ADC did violate the First Amendment right to access to governmental proceedings by restricting access to hearing sounds of an execution and reversed the district court’s decision on this count. However, the court held that the First Amendment right does not encompass knowledge of execution drugs or personnel and affirmed the district court opinion on these counts. Finally, the court held that the Arizona restrictions did not restrict plaintiffs’ First Amendment right of access to the courts. The case was remanded on the reversed count. <i> First Amendment Coal. of Ariz., Inc. v. Ryan </i>, 938 F.3d 1069 (U.S. App. 2019)\n\nThe case is ongoing.", "summary": "Several citizens and residents of Arizona subject to the death penalty brought suit under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC) and several associated governmental employees.

{"document": "On March 6, 2012, a group of individuals convicted of sexual offenses prior to 2011 filed this lawsuit in the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the Governor of Michigan and the director of the Michigan State Police. The plaintiffs alleged that Michigan's 2011 Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) could not be applied to them retroactively. Under SORA, one of the plaintiffs was required to register as a sex offender even though he was not originally convicted of a sex offense. Another plaintiff was required to register on a public registry even though he was promised privacy in his plea agreement. And two of the plaintiffs were required to remain on a public registry for life instead of 25 years. Represented by the ACLU of Michigan, Michigan Clinical Law Program, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief barring SORA's retroactive application. The plaintiffs claimed that SORA violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws, interfered with their fundamental rights to work, travel, speak, and raise their children without being narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest, violated the Due Process Clause, and was void for being too vague. The case was assigned to Judge Robert H. Cleland and referred to Magistrate Judge David R. Grand.  \n\nOn April 24, 2012, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Nearly a year later, on March 18, 2013, the defendants’ motion was granted in part and denied in part. The court granted the defendants’ motion on the ex post facto claim, finding that SORA was a regulatory action and not a criminal statute. The court also granted the defendants’ motion on the claims that SORA interfered with the plaintiffs’ rights to travel and work. The court concluded that the extra procedures imposed by SORA, such as reporting temporary residences or prohibiting loitering in a school zone, did not significantly burden the plaintiffs’ ability to travel interstate or intrastate. Similarly, the court found that SORA did not bar the plaintiffs from electing a particular career. The Act’s only restriction on employment regarded working in a school zone, and the court found that provision to be narrowly tailored to serve the legitimate interests of the State. The court also granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss for claims that applying SORA retroactively was unconstitutional for the plaintiff who were originally convicted of a non-sexual offense and the plaintiff who was offered a plea agreement that stipulated they would not have to register on a public registry. Applying SORA retroactively to these plaintiffs had a legitimate legislative purpose. \n\nHowever, the court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the claim that SORA interfered with the plaintiffs’ rights to raise their children. The court found that the prohibition against any loitering in a school zone may have impeded on the plaintiffs’ ability to raise their children and participate in their education. The court also denied the motion to dismiss the claims from plaintiffs whose registration period on a public registry was extended from twenty-five years to life. The court denied the motion since it was unclear from the complaint whether the defendants had a rational legislative purpose for requiring lifetime registration. The court denied the motion to dismiss claims as to SORA’s vagueness, which had made it impossible for the plaintiffs to comply with its reporting requirements. The court found that additional information was needed to determine if SORA was specific enough for the plaintiffs to understand the requirements imposed on them. The court similarly denied the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim. The court found that additional information was needed to conclude whether SORA’s requirements that the plaintiffs provide all online usernames chilled the plaintiffs’ right to free speech. 932 F.Supp.2d 803. \n\nDiscovery continued for the next year. On February 20, 2014, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. Less than two weeks later, the defendants also moved for summary judgment. Both motions were denied on May 1, 2014. The court instead ordered the parties to cooperate and produce one stipulated factual record, to notify the court of any disputed material facts, and to each file a Motion for Judgment.  \n\nOn March 31, 2015, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ June 27, 2014 Motion for Judgment and the defendants’ July 9, 2014 Motion for Judgment. The court held the plaintiffs’ claims that certain aspects of SORA were too vague were valid, since the plaintiffs had curtailed their conduct as a result of the statute's uncertainty. Specifically, the court held that geographic exclusion zones proscribing where registrants could stand were unconstitutional since they were too vague to inform registrants and law enforcement was constituted a violation. Similarly, requirements that registrants report their telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, instant message addresses, and vehicle registration were too vague to provide registrants or law enforcement with necessary guidelines for what acts triggered a reporting requirement. The court reserved ruling on the plaintiffs’ remaining claims. 101 F.Supp.3d 672.   \n\nOn June 5, 2015, the defendants appealed the district court’s initial ruling to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\nOn September 3, 2015, the district court ruled on the plaintiffs’ remaining claims. The court held that SORA could not retroactively extend the plaintiffs’ reporting requirements from twenty-five years to life. The court found that the defendants did not show that this extension was narrowly tailored to public safety because there was no evidence that sex offenders who had not re-offended in twenty-five years were at an increased risk of committing a different sex offense. 101 F.Supp.3d 722. \n\nOn October 26, 2015 the plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The defendants filed another appeal on November 20, 2015. \n\nOn August 25, 2016, the Sixth Circuit ruled on the appeals. The Sixth Circuit unanimously found that SORA imposed a punishment on the plaintiffs and therefore was an Ex Post Facto law. As a result, retroactive application of SORA was unconstitutional. The case was remanded to the district court to enter judgment consistent with the Sixth Circuit’s opinion. 834 F.3d 696. \n\nThe defendants appealed the Sixth Circuit’s holding to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 14, 2016. \n\nThe parties entered into a stipulated order on April 3, 2017 granting interim injunctive relief pending resolution of the appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The parties agreed that the plaintiffs would not be listed on a public registry, the defendants would not enforce any of SORAs’ provisions that became effective since 2006 against the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs’ registration periods would run for 25 years instead of life. \n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court denied the defendant's petition for certiorari on October 2, 2017.  \n\nThe parties reopened the case in the district court the following month. The defendants moved for judgment on December 4, 2017. The defendants contended that the Sixth Circuit’s decision only affected the plaintiffs in this case and did not apply to SORA itself. \n\nOn January 26, 2018, the district court issued a stipulated final judgment on remand. The court held that retroactive application of SORA’s 2006 and 2011 amendments violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Therefore, the defendants and any other individual were enjoined from enforcing the 2006 and 2011 SORA amendments against the plaintiffs. The court further held that the plaintiffs would not be listed on a public registry and the only requirements of SORA that applied to them were to verify their address quarterly, provide fingerprints, and pay annual fees. Further, their registration period was amended to 25 years instead of life. \n\nThis case is now closed.

The plaintiffs were represented by the ACLU and private counsel. Their complaint alleged that the FBI had conducted a \"threat assessment\" in 2011 that classified Juggalos as a \"loosely organized hybrid gang,\" a designation, the complaint alleged, that caused the plaintiffs various harms, including extra police attention. The plaintiffs alleged, under the APA, that the defendants had violated their constitutional rights in the following ways: (1) agency action contrary to the First Amendment's freedom of association, (2) agency action contrary to the First Amendment's freedom of expression, (3) agency action that violates due process under the Fifth Amendment, (4) arbitrary and capricious agency action, (5) agency action that fails to observe procedures required by law. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. \n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Robert Cleland. On Apr. 9, 2014, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. On June 30, 2014, Judge Cleland granted the motion to dismiss, finding that the alleged injuries were not sufficiently certain or precise to allow them standing to sue. Parsons v. U.S. Department of Justice, 30 F.Supp.3d 648 (E.D. Mich. 2014). \n\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On Sept. 17, 2015, Judge Edmund A. Sargus, Jr., U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation, authored a unanimous opinion reversing the district court's June 30, 2014, dismissal. Judge Sargus found that the plaintiffs did have standing to sue, and did not rule on the merits, but rather remanded the case to the district court. Parsons v. U.S. Department of Justice, 2015 WL 5446909, 801 F.3d 701 (6th Cir. 2015). \n\nOn Jan. 29, 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss the case, and the district court granted the motion on Sept. 29, 2016. The court found that the alleged harms were due to actions of third parties - for example, the local police and sheriff departments - and not the defendants. These harms were therefore not legal consequences, and did not qualify for judicial review under the APA. Further, the court held that the defendants' actions were the result of legally mandated agency discretion and therefore not subject to APA review. Separately, the court did not find merit in the plaintiffs' claim that their classification violated the due process requirement to avoid vagueness as the classification did not require anything of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed notice of appeal on Oct. 13, 2016.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2017, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the case under the same final agency action analysis for APA claims. Echoing the lower court's analysis, it classified the DOJ report as a product of \"independent agency decision making.\" Because the report was purely \"informational,\" the court ruled that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated legal consequences flowing from it. Rather, the harms alleged stemmed from discretionary reliance on the designation by third parties.\n\nWe believe that the case is effectively closed.", "summary": "Six Insane Clown Posse fans, or \"Juggalos,\" sued the DOJ and FBI in the the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under the Administrative Procedures Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act, alleging that the FBI had designated the Juggalos as a \"loosely organized hybrid gang\" in 2011, which had caused various harms to the plaintiffs, including extra police attention.

The plaintiffs sued the City of Buffalo under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment, and under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the National Center for Law and Economic Justice, and the Western New York Law Center, Inc., sought both injunctive and monetary relief. They claimed that the City of Buffalo disproportionately used vehicle checkpoints in Black and Latino communities to generate revenue, resulting in disparate impact on Black and Latino people. Specifically, they claimed that over 85% of checkpoints occurred in predominantly Black or Latino neighborhoods; nearly 40% of checkpoints conducted since 2012 occurred in just three of Buffalo's seventy-seven census tracts, each with a Black or Latino population exceeding 86%. The plaintiffs sought an injunction to end and remediate these traffic enforcement practices, as well as monetary damages for financial harm, humiliation, and loss of liberty and property.\n\nAccording to the complaint, around 2012, the Buffalo Police Department initiated a crime \"Strike Force\" that implemented a vehicle checkpoint program to conduct stops and searches of drivers without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. These checkpoints lasted as long as forty-five minutes and frequently resulted in multiple citations. For example, one class member was issued four separate tickets for having four tinted windows, costing him $720 total. That class member was also forced to choose between jail or the immediate impoundment of his car; he chose the latter, resulting in an addition $125 fee. Under state law, the City of Buffalo kept almost all the revenue collected from traffic tickets.

On July 30, 2020, DRC filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and named the County of Alameda (“the County”), Alameda Health System, and Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (“County Behavioral Health”) as defendants. DRC brought the suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 et seq.

Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and by the Washington Lawyers' Committee Prisoners Rights Project, alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the First Amendment, and asked the court for preliminary injunctive relief, certification as a class action, declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs alleged that the defendants discriminated against them by denying or reducing the plaintiffs' access to telecommunication equipment such as Telecommunication Devices for the Deaf (TDD) and videophones that would allow them to communicate with their friends, family and attorneys outside of the prison system. Plaintiffs who use American Sign Language were denied interpretive service resulting in the denial of governmental services like educational, employment training and opportunities, and heath care programs on the basis of their disability. Plaintiffs were also denied translation services during religious ceremonies and were not provided with an effective means of receiving prison announcements. Lastly, plaintiffs claimed that defendants failed to provide them with interpreters or other aids at disciplinary hearings, thereby denying them the right to hear the charges against them and defend themselves.\n\nThe parties reached a settlement and appointed a monitor and the court approved on June 24, 2015. The settlement required the Kentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC) to ensure a full and equal access to all services and accommodations; assign a staff member at each KDOC adult institution as an ADA coordinator; during initial intake provide effective communication, hearing assessment, and auxiliary aids and services in the form of qualified interpreters, etc.; ensure staff awareness through identification cards; provide deaf inmates with interpretation of materials; provide deaf inmates with a schedule showing when interpretation services are available; ensure deaf and hard of hearing inmates get equal access to on-site and off-site medical care, various programs, work assignments, religious services, any meetings relating to transfer and classification matters; provide interpretation for disciplinary proceedings, announcements, alarms and any other information audibly conveyed to the inmates; provide telecommunication devices and other adequate technology devices; and train KDOC employees on the implementation of new policies.\n\nThe settlement was scheduled to last 5 years, and provided for appointment of a monitor, Margo Schlanger. In February 2016, the monitor filed her first semi-annual report. The report stated that the payment to plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel was made; the requirement of hiring ADA Coordinators were nearly compliant; videophone installation is apparently compliant; free access to videophone, provision of qualified interpreters for unscheduled medical emergencies, and provision of qualified interpreters for disciplinary hearings were unclear; informational materials were partially compliant; the routine and situational reporting were difficult or partially noncompliant; and training was noncompliant. \n\nIn December 2016, the monitor filed her second semi-annual report.  This one included in-depth discussion of needed improvements at 8 of the prisons, and proposed training for officers and staff.  \n\nIn May 2017, the monitor filed her third semi-annual report.  It discussed ongoing compliance challenges, and included several appendices: <ul><li>I. Settlement Agreement<li>II. ADA staff computer-based-training<li>III. ADA Coordinator training<li>IV.

The report concluded that the process for meeting inmate audiology concerns has improved but still needs further progress. \n\nThe fifth semi-annual status report, filed December 2018, explained the state's new audiology policy, and focused on a self-auditing pilot. \n\nThe sixth semi-annual status report, filed April 2019, summarized that while progress was being made, problems remained: <blockquote>Some institutions have implemented a timely and effective audiology process, managed interpretive services effectively, and even worked on improving communication with hard-of-hearing inmates by providing new amplification devices. That said, the most recent self-reporting cycle reveals the widespread continuation of two different kinds of problems. Procedurally, some institutions continue to struggle with keeping and sharing the records needed to comply with the agreement and to check on that compliance, including when I make requests for follow-up. And substantively, self-reporting and follow-ups reveal crucial areas of compliance weakness—areas that I have seen and described consistently in several prior reports, as many as three years ago. These include:\n\n• Identification, tracking, and reporting of inmates who are deaf/hard-of-hearing\n• Ensuring prompt and accurate provision of audiology services\n• Providing interpretation, both in-person and remote\n• Providing videophone services.</blockquote>\n\nThe seventh semi-annual report, filed December 2019, made numerous recommendations to KDOC about continuing issues, and included the department's responses as an exhibit.  The eighth semi-annual report, filed May 2020, tracked (and included) responses to those recommendations. \n\nThe settlement term was set to expire in July 2020, but the parties agreed in a joint filing dated August 3, 2020, to extend it for six months. Monitoring therefore continues through the end of 2020.  On December 16, 2020, the monitor filed the 9th semi-annual report, which found significant improvement.  It included training presentations that had been provided by the monitor in October 2020, and stated:<blockquote>In this current filing, although the COVID pandemic has created real obstacles, I am pleased to report yet more progress. I cannot say that each KDOC prison is complying with each and every settlement agreement provision. However, compliance with many of the ADA/Settlement Agreement requirements has been accomplished. And I believe there is now a system in place that can—if the prison authorities so choose—succeed in maintaining that compliance and in solving remaining problems. In order to assist in that process, I continue to offer recommendations for the period after the settlement term closes. </blockquote>\n", "summary": "On January 1, 2014, deaf and hard of hearing inmates in the Kentucky prison system filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky against the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the Kentucky Department of Corrections, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the First Amendment.

{"document": "On January 2, 2015, a prisoner in Pennsylvania sued the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (\"PDOC\"), several of its employees and administrators in their official and individual capacities, as well as Wexford Health Sources (the provider of medical care in state prisons), in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The lawsuit was brought under the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for the alleged deprivation of the plaintiff's Eighth Amendment rights. The plaintiff alleged that the PDOC systematically denied medical care to persons with severe eye conditions, including severe cataracts. The plaintiff was represented by both private counsel and attorneys from the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project and sought declaratory and injunctive relief; compensatory and punitive damages; and attorneys' fees and costs. Along with his complaint, he filed a motion for class certification. \n\nSince 1999, the plaintiff had suffered from various eye and vision conditions and had received cataract surgery on his right eye in 2001. Prior to 2008, an optometrist determined that the plaintiff's left eye required cataract surgery, to which the plaintiff consented. However, the defendants denied the recommended surgery, and the plaintiff appealed the denial to no avail. The DOC allegedly had an administrative policy colloquially known as the \"One Good Eye\" policy, which denies cataract surgery to those who retain a threshold modicum of visual acuity in one eye, notwithstanding physician recommendations to the contrary. In 2012, the plaintiff was diagnosed with a cataract in his left eye, and his treating ophthalmologist requested surgery, which was scheduled for September 2012, but then postponed the procedure. \n\nThe plaintiff filed an administrative grievance seeking surgery, but in January 2013, the defendant upheld the decision to postpone. In May 2013, the plaintiff received an additional eye examination, his left eye was diagnosed with a \"very dense cataract,\" and he was referred for surgery. One of the defendant's staff instead scheduled the plaintiff for a follow-up consultation three months later and explained that the plaintiff was ineligible for cataract surgery on his left eye because the visual acuity in his right eye measured 20/60. Over the next two years, the plaintiff repeatedly requested further information regarding his ineligibility and filed another administrative grievance, while the cataract in his left eye caused virtual blindness in that eye and allegedly caused the vision in his right eye to deteriorate. He ultimately received cataract surgery on his left eye in Febuary 2015.\n\nWexford filed a motion to dismiss on March 24, 2015. The other defendants filed their own motions to dismiss on April 16, 2015 and June 3, 2015, and the PDOC filed a motion for judgment and to stay discovery on July 17, 2015. Chief Judge Christopher C. Conner granted the motion to stay discovery. After a teleconference with the plaintiffs and defendants on August 24, 2015, however, the Court ordered that the defendants had failed to show good cause for keeping their cataract surgery policy confidential, although such policy has not appeared in the Court record yet. \n\nOn July 17, 2015, the PDOC and its administrators filed a motion to stay discovery pending disposition of the plaintiff's motion for class certification, the defendants' motion to dismiss, and the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. On July 21, 2015, the Court granted the motion. \n\nOn September 18, 2015, the Court denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification without prejudice. The Court stated that it would allow limited discovery related to the eligibility of this case for class action certification. \n\nOn January 20, 2016, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss. The motions were denied as to the allegations that the defendants discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of disability in violation of the ADA or § 504, and that some of the staff member defendants violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment in their individual capacities. The motions were granted as to the allegations that Wexford and some of the staff member defendants, acting in their official capacities, violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and that the same staff member defendants, acting in their official capacities, violated Pennsylvania's constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. The Court noted that the plaintiff had sought only injunctive relief against some of the defendants and, because he had received the cataract surgery, those claims were moot. 159 F. Supp. 3d 502.\n\nOn February 4, 2016, the parties jointly moved to stay pretrial deadlines pending the conclusion of settlement negotiations. On February 8, the Court granted the parties' motion and ordered that counsel submit status reports every 60 days.\n\nOn April 8, 2016, the plaintiff wrote a letter notifying the Court that settlement negotiations with the PDOC and two of its administrators were proceeding but that negotiations with Wexford and its physicians had stalled. On April 19, 2016, the plaintiff moved to partially lift the stay with respect to the Wexford defendants, which the Court denied on April 20, 2016. Negotiations continued throughout the remainder of the year.\n\nOn January 17, 2017, Chief Judge Conner signed an order referring the case for purposes of settlement only to Magistrate Judge Martin C. Carlson. A mediation took place on February 7, 2017.\n\nOn February 8, 2017, Chief Judge Conner ordered the case dismissed without costs and without prejudice under the terms of a settlement agreement to which the parties had agreed.\n\nThirty days after February 8, 2017, PDOC agreed to adopt a new cataract policy to replace the old \"One Good Eye\" policy. An individual would be eligible for cataract surgery even if the individual has one eye that does not need to be operated on. Additionally, individuals who were denied surgery under the old policy would be evaluated on a rolling basis according to the new cataract policy. The PDOC would also let individuals know about the policy change, and provide surgical evaluations for individuals with cataracts and post-operative care after the cataract surgery. For 3 years after February 8, 2017, the PDOC would provide plaintiff's counsel with an accounting of individuals who have cataracts and how they were evaluated under the new cataract policy. They must also provide plaintiff's counsel with a copy of proposed changes or revisions to the new cataract policy, if any. The PDOC also agreed to pay the plaintiff $16,500 but did not agree to pay attorneys' fees. The parties agreed that the Court would retain jurisdiction over the implementation and enforcement of this agreement for 3 years, after which the case would be dismissed with prejudice. On March 21, 2017, the parties signed a formal settlement agreement.\n\nLitigation continued over attorneys' fees and costs. \n\nOn February 23, 2018, Magistrate Judge Carlson conducted a settlement conference for the parties. The parties reached an agreement, and on February 26, 2018, Chief Judge Connor ordered that a motion by the plaintiff for attorneys' fees be dismissed as moot because of this resolution. \n\nOn March 30, 2018, an individual sent a handwritten letter to the Court explaining that he had not received surgery for his cataracts and that his vision was deteriorating. Judge Carlson forwarded this letter to counsel for both parties. \n\nThe settlement agreement expired without any further docket activity, so the case is now closed.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Southern Poverty Law Center, sought a court order mandating due process hearings before the school district issues long-term suspensions or expulsions. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that the school district violated the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by denying students a hearing before issuing long-term suspensions or expulsions. The plaintiffs also alleged that the school district also failed to notify parents before a suspension or expulsion was issued and denied students the right to defend themselves against accusations and to have an advocate or legal counsel present at a hearing.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged the Mobile County Public School System frequently used long-term suspensions and expulsions as disciplinary measures for minor infractions. These disciplinary measures have severe detrimental impacts on students, and plaintiffs claimed that to employ these measures without a hearing is a violation of due process. School administrators often used these measures not only without a hearing, but also without informing students' parents before the suspension was issued, a violation of the School Code of Conduct Handbook. To the extent that administrators acted against the disciplinary code, the plaintiffs claimed the Board of Commissioners turned a blind eye to these actions and failed in their duties to train and supervisor administrators. \n\nOn March 1, 2013, the parties entered mediation and on June 10, 2013, the District Court (Judge William H.

{"document": "In 1870, Congress passed Mississippi’s Readmission Act returning Mississippi to full statehood following the Civil War on certain conditions including that “the constitution of Mississippi shall never be so amended or changed as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United States of the school rights and privileges secured by the constitution of said State.” 16 Stat. 67 (1870). \n\nOn May 23, 2017,  four low-income African American women filed this lawsuit on behalf of their children, students of Mississippi schools, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi against various officials in Mississippi's government, including the Governor, Speaker of the House, Lieutenant Governor and presider over the Senate, Secretary of State, and the entire Board of Education. Represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and co-counsel, the plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and <i>Ex parte Young</i> claiming that Mississippi failed to meet its obligations related to \"school rights and privileges\" under the Mississippi Readmission Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment that the educational requirements under the 1869 Mississippi Constitution and the Readmission Act remain in effect and that the current Mississippi Constitution conflicts with the Readmission Act. In addition, they sought attorneys' fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge William H. Barbour.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Mississippi was not upholding the Readmission Act because there was a significant disparity in the conditions and education at plaintiffs' schools where students were primarily African American and schools where students were predominantly white and wealthy. The state’s top five highest-performing school districts were predominantly white whereas thirteen of the state’s nineteen school districts with an “F” rating were more than 95 percent African American. The plaintiffs’ children attended elementary schools in the Jackson Public School District and the Yazoo City Municipal School District, both with an “F” letter grade from the Mississippi Department of Education. The plaintiffs claimed the schools lacked textbooks, supplies, and experienced teachers and were in poor condition. For example, the complaint noted that at some schools paint was peeling off the walls and the ceilings had visible water spots.  \n\nOn March 28, 2018, Judge Barbour dismissed the case with prejudice, finding that it was barred under Eleventh Amendment Immunity. The Court found that while the plaintiffs were only suing state officials, not the state, they were suing state officials in their official capacities, and therefore, the state was the real substantial party in interest and enjoyed sovereign immunity. Further, the Court held that the <i>Ex parte Young</i> doctrine that creates an exception to state sovereign immunity, was not applicable in this case because the plaintiffs were not seeking injunctive relief. \n\nThe plaintiffs then moved to have the judgment altered and for leave to file an amended complaint. On January 4, 2019, Judge Barbour found the Court did not err in finding the claims barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity, but altered the judgment so that the case was dismissed without prejudice. 2019 WL 3757948. He denied the plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint and entered a final judgment dismissing the case without prejudice. The plaintiffs promptly appealed the judgment to the Fifth Circuit on January 25, 2019. The appeal was docketed as 19-60069.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit (Circuit Judges Stephen A. Higginson, E. Grady Jolly, and James E. Graves Jr.) affirmed in part and vacated in part. 954 F.3d 729. It found the plaintiffs' claim seeking a declaration that the current version of Mississippi's Constitution violated the Readmissions Act could be pursued under the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception to state sovereign immunity because the defendants were state officers sued in their official capacities and the plaintiffs alleged a continuing violation of federal law--the Readmission Act. However, the Fifth Circuit affirmed that the claim seeking a declaration that the 1868 Mississippi Constitution remained in effect was barred by state sovereign immunity and <i>Ex parte Young</i> did not apply because this would require a federal court to tell state officials how to conform to state law. The Fifth Circuit denied the defendants' request for rehearing en banc (9-8). 981 F.3d 437 Circuit Judge Edith H. Jones, joined by the seven other Circuit Judges voting for rehearing, dissented, arguing that the request for a declaration the current Mississippi Constitution violated the federal Readmission Act would necessarily require the impermissible adjudication of a question of state law.  \n\nOn January 13, 2021, the defendants filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court (Case No. 20A126). They also filled an application with the Supreme Court to stay the mandate of the Fifth Circuit pending the Supreme Court's decision on whether to grant review. Back in the district court, the case was reassigned to District Judge Kristi H. Jonhson and then District Judge Henry T. Wingate in January 2021. As of February 5, 2021, the petition for review remained pending, and the case is ongoing. \n", "summary": "In 2017, four low-income African American mothers filed suit against the numerous officials of the State of Mississippi claiming the state failed to live up to the educational requirements set by the Mississippi Readmission Act of 1870.

The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit which affirmed in part and reversed in part. The defendants requested rehearing en banc, but the Fifth Circuit denied the request.

{"document": "This is a case about the Women’s National Soccer Team (WNT) suing the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) for gender discrimination. On March 8, 2019, members of the WNT filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs sued the USSF under the Equal Pay Act (EPA), 29 U.S.C. § 206(d) et seq., and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. Represented by Winston & Strawn LLP, the plaintiffs sought damages & fees (including back pay), an injunction against the USSF engaging in its gender discrimination practices, a declaratory judgment that such practices were unlawful, and an adjustment to their wages and benefits. They claimed that the USSF had been paying them less than similarly situated male employees despite better performance in violation of the EPA. Their complaint also stated that the USSF has been treating them less favorably than their male colleagues in violation of Title VII, specifically with respect to “pay; playing, training and travel conditions; promotion of games; and support and development for games.”\n\nThe WNT has had world-wide success. It has been ranked first in the world according to FIFA’s Women’s World Rankings for ten of the past eleven years; it has won three World Cup titles and four Olympic Gold Medals; and has won numerous other awards and accolades. Plaintiffs alleged that because of this success, they spend more time training, competing, and participating in media sessions than their male counterparts. They furthermore contended that they earned more profit and/or revenue for the USSF than the Men’s National Soccer Team (MNT) during the period relevant to this case.\n\nDespite this, the plaintiffs claimed that USSF has continued to treat its female employees worse than its similarly situated male employees. For non-tournament games called “friendlies”, the complaint calculated that if all games were won, the WNT would earn on average 38% that of the MNT. For the 2014 World Cup, the MNT earned $5,375,000 in “performance bonuses” after being knocked out in Round 16. In contrast, in 2015, the WNT earned only $1,725,000 after winning the entire World Cup. But the plaintiffs said that the disparate treatment extended to policies and practices as well. The WNT was much more often forced to play on inferior surfaces such as artificial turf, which affect the game and are more likely to lead to injury; the MNT has consistently received charter flights while the WNT has had to fly commercial; the USSF has allocated fewer resources for promoting WNT games than for promoting MNT games, and waited longer before announcing their games leading to reduced attendance; and the USSF charged less for tickets to WNT games than to MNT games, reducing the potential revenue from their games.\n\nThe WNT began collective bargaining for equal pay through their union in 2012, but the USSF has continually rejected their demands. In fact, in response to their 2012 demands, the USSF countered that they would only compensate the WNT for winning games against FIFA top-ranked teams (the MNT, by comparison, were always paid no matter the outcome of the game or the rank of the opposing team). According to the complaint, in 2016, a representative of the USSF claimed that “market realities are such that the women do not deserve to be paid equally to the men,” after openly admitting that the WNT outperformed the MNT in both revenue and profit the prior year. In 2017, the WNT proposed a revenue-sharing model to test these “market realities” wherein their pay would increase or decrease based on whether the USSF derived more or less revenue from WNT’s activities. The USSF rejected this proposal.\n\nUpon filing the suit on March 8, 2019, plaintiffs filed a motion to transfer the case to Multidistrict Litigation, but this was denied on June 10, 2019.

On May 1, 2020,  Judge R. Gary Klausner denied the plaintiff’s motion and granted the defendant’s motion in part. The EPA claim was denied because (1) the WNT was paid more both on a cumulative and average per-game basis than the MNT, and (2) the WNT failed to offer sufficient evidence that despite this, they were being undercompensated compared to the MNT.

{"document": "On March 16, 2001, an African-American employee of the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (\"WASA\") filed this class action lawsuit against WASA on behalf of himself as well as current and former black employees under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory damages, claiming that the defendant engaged in race discrimination through its hiring and promotion practices. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that in 1996 the defendant adopted an at-will employment system that allowed managers to hire or promote their chosen candidates or to inflate those candidates' scores. With this new system in place, the plaintiff claimed that African-American employees encountered a \"glass ceiling\" that prevented them from obtaining the same positions as similarly situated white employees and from advancing as rapidly as those employees. The plaintiff alleged in particular that black employees were hired at the lowest levels of the agency, were forced to wait longer than white employees for promotions, and were often skipped over for promotions in favor of equally experienced white employees. The plaintiff sought to certify a class consisting of all African-American employees who applied for and were denied positions or promotions at WASA from October 1996 through December 2000.\n\nThe defendant moved to dismiss the case on May 21, 2001, claiming that because the plaintiffs requested compensatory damages and a jury trial in addition to injunctive relief, they could not, as a matter of law, satisfy the requirements for class certification under FRCP 23(b). The District Court (Judge Henry H. Kennedy) denied the motion, explaining that the D.C. Circuit had adopted an \"ad-hoc approach\" to the issue and that the case law did not regard compensatory damages claims or a request for a jury trial as per se incompatible with class certification under 23(b). <i>Taylor v. Dist. of Columbia Water & Sewer Auth.</i>, 205 F.R.D. 43, 2002 WL 5513 (D.D.C. 2002).   \n\nThe parties then engaged in a lengthy discovery battle. On March 13, 2007, the District Court (Judge Kennedy) certified the class as to liability under FRCP 23(b) for injunctive and declaratory relief, but it postponed any certification as to damages. <i>Taylor v. Dist. of Columbia Water & Sewer Auth.,</i>  241 F.R.D. 33, 2007 WL 766229 (D.D.C. 2007). The defendant appealed this ruling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (Judge Karen L. Henderson) denied the petition as untimely on April 3, 2009. <i>In re D.C. Water & Sewer Auth.</i>, 561 F.3d 494 (D.C. Cir. 2009). \n\nThe plaintiffs moved to enlarge the class period on November 14, 2007, and the District Court (Judge Kennedy) denied this motion in an unpublished order on February 7, 2008. The parties then continued disputing the class composition and notice procedures until August 25, 2009, when the District Court (Judge Kennedy) acceded to the parties' request and issued a stipulation and order approving the class notice and directing issuance of the notice to class members.\n\nOn November 30, 2010, at the parties' request, the District Court (Judge Kennedy) issued an order referring the case for alternative dispute resolution. The parties eventually reached an agreement and submitted a proposed settlement for approval on March 23, 2013. \n\nThe District Court (Judge Barbara J. Rothstein) issued an order, on March 28, 2013, approving the class settlement. The Court announced that, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes</i>, 131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011), it was vacating the class certification under FRCP 23(b)(2) and recertifying the class under 23(b)(3). The approved class had 1,037 members, consisting of all African-American employees who worked for the defendant between October 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, WASA transmitted $2,885,000 to a claims administrator, with $1.9 million set aside for the payment of claims and the remaining funds to be used for attorneys' fees, litigation costs, and a service award to the lead plaintiff. The settlement also included substantial non-monetary relief. Under the agreement, WASA was forbidden from retaliating against any class members for their involvement in the litigation, and was required to provide employees with a written statement of its commitment to equal employment opportunity and post a copy of this policy in common areas of the workplace. WASA also agreed to conduct a mandatory diversity and equal employment opportunity training for all employees and take measures to ensure that employees understand their obligations to identify and report violations of the policies. WASA further agreed to develop and implement complaint procedures and a complaint tracking system, as well as a voluntary affirmative action program. A settlement compliance monitor was assigned to oversee and report on WASA's implementation of the agreement, and WASA agreed to submit reports for the monitor's review. Finally, WASA agreed to create an internal implementation team as well as institute an annual review of pay and data practices to ensure that any racial disparities in pay are due to legitimate and non-discriminatory factors.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the District Court (Judge Rothstein), after receiving a letter from class members who claimed that they had not yet been paid their monetary award, issued an order requiring the parties to provide a status report. Plaintiffs' counsel responded on March 18 and explained that there had been a delay because WASA inadvertently omitted several people from the list of eligible class members it prepared for the claims administrator. Further compounding this delay, plaintiffs' counsel stated that his co-counsel has been preparing a motion to advise the court on how the administrator calculated the payouts to individual class members. The money would not be disbursed until this motion was filed. The matter resolved in June 2015 when the court ordered counsel to furnish the five individuals with proper documents to file for disbursement. \n\nThe balance of $14,025.38 in settlement funds were distributed to the District of Columbia Legal Aid Society upon a motion by the parties on October 4, 2017.

The Court reasoned that individuals cannot bring pattern or practice claims and each individual alleged wrongdoing was time barred. \n\nAfter more discovery and pre-trial motions, the case went into a bench trial. On May 13, 2010, the Court (Judge William H. Pauley III) issued an opinion and order, finding for the plaintiff United States. The court found that the defendant was engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination, by not having objective hiring criteria, giving preference to less qualified male applicants, and maintaining a hostile work environment.

The suit alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as 42 U.S.C. §1981 and 42 U.S.C. §1983.  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for compensatory damages, declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.\n\nThe eleven individual plaintiffs in this action are Asian American police officers employed by the defendant (Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) who claimed they were denied promotion because of their race. All eleven of the plaintiffs are members of the Port Authority Police Asian Jade Society of New York and New Jersey Inc. (\"Asian Jade Society\"), a nonprofit organization whose purpose is to promote good relations among the members of the Port Authority police department. \n\nDuring the relevant period, the Port Authority utilized a promotion process where entry-level police officers could be promoted to the rank of Sergeant, the first level in the hierarchy of supervisory positions.  Periodically, each facility's commanding officer would make a recommendation for officers for promotion, at their discretion, and after the applicant had passed an exam.  Recommended officers would then be evaluated by the Chiefs' Board, each board member would vote for or against each officer and those who received a majority would be recommended to the superintendent; the board did not use any written guidelines. The ultimate decision to promote an officer belonged solely to the Superintendent and promotions occurred outside of this hiring process.  As of January 31, 2001, no Asian American had been promoted to Sergeant.  \n\nThe Asian Jade Society filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on behalf of the eleven members on January 31, 2001. The EEOC determined there was reasonable cause to believe race discrimination had occurred under Title VII.  The plaintiffs filed suit on April 15, 2005, alleging that the Port Authority had discriminated against Asian Americans in making promotions to Sergeant.  \n\nOn March 11, 2009, a nine-day trial commenced in the Southern District of New York, before Judge Miriam Cedarbaum. The jury found that the Port Authority's promotion practice had a disparate impact on Asian-American police officers and that the defendant had utilized a pattern or practice of intentional discrimination with respect to seven of the eleven plaintiffs.  On April 14, 2010, Port Authority was ordered to pay the seven plaintiffs $1,637,622 in back pay and compensatory damages.  Additionally, Port Authority was ordered to pay $2,357,659 in attorneys' fees and costs. \n\nThe Port Authority appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to support each plaintiffs' theories, that evidence barred by the statute of limitations was admitted, and that damages were awarded on time-barred claims.  The four plaintiffs who did not prevail at trial cross-appealed and argued that the district court erred by excluding expert testimony. \n\nOn July 10, 2012, the Court of Appeals (Judge Dennis Jacobs) found the district court erred in impliedly instructing the jury that a common pattern of discrimination is an element of liability.  The circuit court declined to extend the pattern-or-practice method of proof outside of the class action context (federal Courts of Appeals have consistently held that the pattern-or-practice method of proof is not available to private non class plaintiffs).  The court affirmed the lower court's judgment with respect to the disparate impact and the individual disparate treatment claims.  Where the plaintiffs relied on the continuing violations doctrine to prove disparate impact, the back pay and compensatory damages were reversed since the continuing violation doctrine does not apply to disparate impact proof.  Failures to promote are considered discrete acts and the continuing violations doctrine requires conduct to be a part of an ongoing discriminatory policy. \n\nThe Second Circuit court easily affirmed the district court's judgment regarding the four plaintiffs who did not prevail at trial, finding no abuse of discretion. Ultimately, the court remanded for new trial all compensatory damages and equitable relief remedies and affirmed the back pay only for conduct that occurred within the requisite time period.\n\nOn remand, there is a notice that the parties were required to submit proposed verdict forms to the District Court by the end of June 2013.

The harassment eventually led to the harasser physically attacking the complainant. Prior to the attack, the complainant complained to her supervisors about the harasser’s racialized and sexualized comments toward her, but her supervisors did very little to address her concerns. At one point, she complained to the supervisor and he responded by saying: “why don’t you just go ahead and f#@k him and get it over with?” After constantly rejecting the harasser’s sexual advances, the harasser physically attacked the complainant.

{"document": "On September 28, 2006, the San Francisco district office of the EEOC brought this lawsuit against United Airlines in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The EEOC alleged that United Airlines had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Civil Rights Act. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendant had refused reasonable accommodation to individuals with disabilities by disallowing them to work fewer than thirty hours per week. The EEOC claimed that these actions adversely affected their status as employees due to their disabilities and sought injunctive and monetary relief as well as attorney’s fees. \n\nOn February 14, 2008, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied on March 21 by Judge Thomas S. Zilly. The court held that there are material issues of fact as to the fundamental job duties of the employment position at issue and what constitutes a reasonable accommodation. In addition, the court held that the defendant’s offer of a three-year unpaid leave is not a “reasonable accommodation” for a disabled claimant who did not have a temporary medical condition. \n\nOn May 29, three other employees of United Airlines filed a motion to intervene as putative class representatives, but the court denied their intervention as class representatives and granted them leave to intervene as individual plaintiffs-intervenors on July 16.

The trainer would be a qualified outside consultant, approved by the EEOC and knowledgeable in the ADA. 3) record keeping and reports: United Airline will mail to counsel a report of training provided and requests for reduced hours accommodations.

{"document": "On August 14, 2013, private citizens filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Missouri against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment. The plaintiff, represented by the public interest firm Thomas More Society, asked the court for an exception to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandate requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage of contraception. Due to the ACA mandate, the plaintiffs' employer, the State of Missouri, only offered a health insurance plan that includes contraception coverage. The plaintiffs claimed paying for this health insurance plan violated their Catholic religious beliefs and their right to family integrity.\n\nOn September 10, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the plaintiffs do not have claim upon which relief can be granted. The defendants' motion argued that the ACA contraception mandate applies only to employers, not private individuals. Furthermore, defendants argued that if the government began allowing individual exceptions to certain aspects of insurance policies the group insurance model would fall apart.\n\nOn October 16, 2013, the court (Judge Jean C. Hamilton) granted defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of standing. The court found that because plaintiffs' alleged injuries were linked with the independent discretionary actions of the State and his health insurance provider, neither of which were parties to the action, plaintiffs alleged only indirect causation between the contraception mandate and their alleged injuries. Moreover, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that an injunction of the government's' policy would alter the behavior of these third parties. These third parties would retain discretion not to offer plaintiff a health plan that excludes contraception and abortion. 978 F. Supp. 2d 1008.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and the case was heard before a panel of three judges: Judge Roger Wollman, Judge James Loken, and Judge Diana Murphy. On July 20, 2015, the Court of Appeals reversed. In an opinion by Judge Wollman, the court pointed out that, prior to the enactment of the contraception mandate, the insurance provider and the state had been willing to offer the plaintiffs a contraceptive-free healthcare plan. It concluded that this was persuasive evidence that the insurance provider might well alter its policy if the plaintiffs succeeded on the merits of their claim, and therefore that the injury was not too speculative for adjudication. The case was remanded to the district court for decision on the merits. 793 F. 3d 949.\n\nThe defendants filed another motion to dismiss. On January 8, 2016, the court granted the motion in part and denied it in part: the plaintiffs’ constitutional and APA claims were dismissed with prejudice, but the RFRA claim remained at issue because the plaintiffs alleged that the mandate imposed a substantial burden on their exercise of religion. 2016 WL 98170.\n\nOn May 24, 2016, the defendants moved for summary judgment. Three weeks later, the plaintiffs did so as well. On July 21, 2016, the court granted the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants’. Judge Hamilton entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, enjoining the defendants from requiring the plaintiffs’ health insurance issuer to provide them with health insurance that includes contraceptive coverage. The order applied only to health plans provided to the plaintiffs.196 F. Supp. 3d 1010. \n\nOn August 18, 2016, the plaintiffs moved to recover attorneys’ fees, but agreed to stay briefing on this motion on September 1 after the government indicated that it would likely appeal the district court's decision.

Burwell</i>, 136 S.Ct. 1557 (2016). In the wake of that decision, on July 21, 2016, HHS sent out a Request for Information (RFI) to determine \"whether modifications to the existing accommodation procedure could resolve the objections asserted by the plaintiffs in the pending RFRA cases while still ensuring that the affected women seamlessly receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.\" Since the Eighth Circuit had already decided to withhold further action in <i>Sharpe</i> until after the government filed a status report on the RFI on November 30, it likewise agreed on November 23 to abey proceedings in this case.\n\nOn February 13, 2017, the date when the abeyance was set to expire, the government wrote to the Eighth Circuit indicating that both parties agreed to extend the abeyance by an additional sixty days. The government explained that the change in presidential administrations that year would likely bear significantly on the issues of this case, with the possibility of the dispute being mooted entirely. Following President Trump's May 4 executive order directing a change in regulations to allow for conscience-based exceptions to the ACA's contraceptive-care mandate, the parties agreed to have the case dismissed on November 13, 2017.

{"document": "On May 17, 2018, a Catholic foster care and social services agency and {} filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, against the City of Philadelphia. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and by conservative public interest organization the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, alleged that city of Philadelphia revoked new referrals of foster children to their organization because of their faith-based opposition to same-sex marriage. The complaint sought monetary and injunctive relief for violations of under 42 U.S.C. §1983, breach of contract, the First Amendment, Pennsylvania Constitution, and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Petrese B. Tucker. \n\nPlaintiffs asserted that Philadelphia's decision to revoke new foster care referrals breached their contract with the city and targeted them on religious grounds. According to the plaintiffs, the city had previously excepted them from providing foster care services to same-sex couples, and therefore the city's contract was ambiguous on whether they were required to provide these services to same-sex couples. They also alleged that the public statements made by the Mayor of Philadelphia and other public officials criticizing their refusal to serve same-sex couples indicated the city's decision to suspend the contract constituted religious discrimination.  \n\nOn June 7, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction requesting that the Court reinstate referrals of foster children to the plaintiff. The defendants' opposition argued that the plaintiffs violated the City's Fair Practice Ordinance, which forbids discrimination against individuals in public accommodations, and was clearly included in the contract. Since the defendants were acting on behalf of the city, and the city was previously unaware of the plaintiffs' refusal to serve otherwise qualified same-sex couples, the defendants argued that they were within their right to suspend the contract. \n\nOn July 13, 2018, Judge Petrese B. Tucker denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and TRO. Judge Tucker held that the parties' intent was clear: the Fair Practices ordinance applied to the contract and that plaintiffs' services fell within \"public accommodations\"; therefore, the plaintiffs were required to serve anyone who sought their services. 320 F.Supp.3d 661. The Court rejected the defendants' claims that this violated the Free Exercise clause; it held that the city's policy was neutral and also found that there was insufficient discriminatory intent to trigger strict scrutiny review. \n\nThe plaintiffs appealed on the same day of this decision. On April 22, 2019, the United State Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision, in an opinion by Judge Thomas L. Ambro. The Court of Appeals held that the City's nondiscrimination policy was neutral and the religious views of the plaintiff did not entitle it to an exception from the policy. Additionally, the Third Circuit found that the City had not targeted the plaintiffs \"for its religious beliefs\" nor was its decision \"motivated by ill will against [the plaintiff's] religion, rather than sincere opposition to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\" 922 F.3d 140. \n\nThe plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari on July 22, 2019.

{"document": "The background to this case concerns a policy known as the Small Area Fair Market Rent (“FMR”) rule that was set to go into effect on January 1, 2018, after years of advocacy, research, and public debate. The rule required the public housing agencies (PHAs) that administered the Housing Choice Voucher program (formerly Section 8) to set voucher values in 24 metropolitan areas based on the prevailing private market rents for each distinct zip code within those regions. The revised methodology recognized the existence of very different local rental markets within each metropolitan area and calibrated the vouchers more closely to the amount needed to live in various neighborhoods. It thus enabled voucher holders to access a wider range of housing, outside of voucher-concentrated, racially-segregated areas.\n\nHowever, in August 2017, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) abruptly announced it would be delaying the rule’s implementation for two years, claiming that further study was needed. HUD stated the agency was waiting for a final review of the Small Area FMR report and a further review of public comments. Additionally, HUD determined that the Public Housing Authorities had not been given enough guidance and technical assistance to implement the use of Small Area FMRs.\n\nOn October 23, 2017, Open Communities Alliance and two individual plaintiffs, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against HUD and its Secretary. The complaint challenged HUD’s decision to suspend a rule that would have assisted low-income families in securing affordable housing. The Plaintiffs claimed that the delay would only further racial and economic segregation, and argued that HUD’s failure to implement the Small Area FMR rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the statute that governs how federal agencies propose and implement regulations. The Plaintiffs, represented by the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and private counsel, sought to temporarily and permanently enjoin the suspension of the rule.\n\nOn December 23, 2017, Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell granted the Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, requiring HUD to reinstate the Small Area Fair Market Rent regulation, criticizing HUD's decision to suspend final rules for two years without notice or comment or evidentiary findings. 2017 WL 6558502. The Defendants requested an extension to contemplate how to proceed with the litigation. The extension was granted, and the Defendants' response was due February 15, 2018.\n\nOn February 15, 2018, the parties stipulated that the HUD would no longer delay implementing the FMR rules and allowed the court to enter judgment for the Plaintiffs. HUD acknowledged that it was in the process of implementing the FMR rules. \n\nThe Plaintiffs then moved for attorney's fees. On February 15, 2018, the Court entered final judgment for the Plaintiffs. Attorney's fees of $154,272.11 were awarded on June 15, 2018. 2018 WL 8622230.

{"document": "On November 7, 2002, the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division (\"DOJ\") sent its \"findings letter\" to Kentucky's governor, advising him of the results of the November 2001, DOJ investigation of conditions and practices at the Oakwood Developmental Center (\"Oakwood\"), a state-operated center in Somerset, Kentucky, for developmentally and mentally disabled persons.  (Although legally a \"commonwealth,\" Kentucky will be referred to in this summary as a state, as it is more commonly known.)  The investigations occurred under the authority of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  DOJ and expert consultants visited the facility, reviewed a wide array of documents there, and conducted interviews with personnel and residents.  The letter commended Oakwood and state government staff for providing a high level of cooperation during the investigation.  The investigation found multiple deficiencies in resident care at Oakwood, in that numerous conditions and services there substantially departed from generally accepted standards of care.  Constitutional and federal statutory rights of residents at the facility were violated in several respects, according to the DOJ.\n\nDOJ concluded that deficiencies existed in conditions of resident care and treatment due to Oakwood's failure to provide adequate: (1) protection of its residents from harm due to abuse, mistreatment, neglect, improper use of restraints, pica behavior (ingestion of non-food items), and an overall lack of environmental safety; (2) behavioral and psychology services, including adequate treatment team meetings, individual and behavioral support plans, and training programs; (3) psychiatric services; (4) medical care, including neurological care; (5) nursing care; (6) staffing and staff training; (7) nutritional management; (8) physical therapy, and (9) quality assurance mechanisms designed to self-correct institutional problems.  The letter provided details of deficiencies for all of these categories.  \n\nThis summary provides examples of these details, using the numeric indicator from the prior paragraph, as follows: (1) numerous and recurring incidents of abuse and neglect by staff; continued employment of documented abusers; inadequate investigations of incidents; unacceptably high volume of abuse and neglect incidents; inadequate supervision and communication regarding residents known for pica or self-injurious behaviors;  (2) inadequate interdisciplinary care team meetings and individual/behavior support plans; overuse of chemical and physical restraints;  inadequate resident training programs; insufficient psychological staff resources;  (3) incorrect psychiatric diagnoses and use of psychotropic medications without psychiatric diagnoses; no peer review of psychiatric care nor any functional system for treatment of movement disorders; untrained staff;  (4) poor preventative care, medical monitoring, communication among medical professionals, record keeping, and mortality review; inadequate evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment for seizure disorders leading to improper medication usage;  (5) fragmented, incomplete, and inconsistent nursing assessments and documentations; high level of medication errors; vague medical emergency protocols and inadequate documentation of emergencies by poorly trained staff; outdated and ineffective infection control practices; haphazard staffing;  (6 and 7) inadequate individual meal management plans; unmonitored, unaided meals for residents with swallowing difficulties; under-staffing at mealtimes resulting in cold food;  (7 and 8) absence of a positioning program; overuse of wheelchairs; inadequately trained direct care staff; understaffed physical therapy department;  and (9) no quality improvement program capable of addressing systemic crises in clinical services; absence of formal feedback system; nursing performance goals not objective and measurable, precluding reliable assessment and monitoring; and a total lack of a management information system.\n\nIn addition to the remarkable list of deficiencies at Oakwood, the letter also noted that the state regularly deprived Oakwood residents who desired to live in the community and who reasonably can be accommodated an adequate opportunity to do so, in violation of the state's obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq., and ADA-related regulations.\n\nTen pages of minimally-acceptable remedial measures for each of these categories were outlined in the letter, which concluded by inviting continued further collaboration in implementing the remediation.  The letter provided notice that, absent a resolution of the federal concerns, the DOJ would file a CRIPA lawsuit to compel correction of the identified deficiencies at Oakwood.\n\nSubsequently, on September 21, 2004, the state and DOJ entered into a memorandum of understanding, setting out a \"Strategic Action Plan\" that aimed to resolve the many deficiencies in care and conditions at Oakwood (which, by this time, had been re-named and re-organized as the Communities at Oakwood).  It included the appointment of a jointly-selected monitor, Dr. Nirbhay N. Singh, Ph. D., to oversee, at state expense, Kentucky's implementation of the memorandum and its plan. The plan, an attachment to the memorandum, set specific goals and target dates for achieving them.\n\nOn August 31, 2006, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, DOJ simultaneously filed a CRIPA complaint against the state and a settlement agreement between the parties, the latter referencing and attaching the strategic action plan obligating the state to implement remedial measures.  The settlement named the same monitor, who would also now report compliance progress to the court. The lawsuit, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, described practices at Oakwood that violated the residents' Fourteenth Amendment due process rights and their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C §§ 12101 et seq., and the ADA's implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 35.  \n\nThe settlement obligated the state to ensure, and to periodically document its progress in ensuring, improvements that would bring the facility up to generally accepted professional standards of care.

The Court also held that defendants, in accordance with the FLSA, were required to reimburse plaintiffs for travel expenses if they brought plaintiffs' income below minimum wage, during the first work week. According to the employment contract, defendants were also required to reimburse plaintiffs for daily travel expenses and to pay plaintiffs overtime. Accordingly, on May 20, 2011, the Court denied defendants' numerous motions for summary judgment, and granted plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment related to violations of the FLSA and H-2A employment contracts, as well as their motion for summary judgment on the issue of employer status and liability of defendants. 2011 WL 1978414. The Court denied defendants' motion for reconsideration of the matter the next month.

{"document": "On December 19, 2013, four immigration detainees of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 against ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that ICE violated the plaintiffs’ rights under the First and Fifth Amendments and the Immigration and Nationality Act. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that ICE restricted their access to telephones, contrary to the agency’s National Detention Standards, thereby denying or severely limiting the plaintiffs’ statutory and constitutional rights to retain counsel, to communicate with retained counsel, to gather and present evidence, to obtain a fair hearing, to apply for immigration benefits, and to petition for documents that might help them avoid deportation.\n\nThe plaintiffs were in ICE custody pending deportation proceedings. Most detainees were geographically isolated from family, courts, and attorneys. As a result, telephone access was critical. Many detainees would qualify for one or more of the several forms of “relief from removal,” but because of ICE policies restricting telephone access many plaintiffs were unnecessarily detained for months. Many were forced to seek multiple continuances while they attempted to gather information and documents to contest their deportation. Others would accept deportation much earlier if they were able to obtain legal consultation over the telephone.\n\nThe following are examples of the practices restricting telephone access, some of which violated ICE’s own detention standards: Detainees are confined for up to 22 hours a day and are permitted to make calls only during inconsistently scheduled “free time,” which is often early in the morning or at night. Detainees have no privacy when using telephones. Phone calls from the facilities are prohibitively expensive, especially for indigent detainees. Detainees are completely unable to receive incoming calls. Telephone systems in the facilities disconnect after 15 minutes, or if a recorded greeting begins to play (including voicemail or automated systems requiring the selection of options to reach a live person). Although ICE policy requires that detainees have access to a free-call platform for contacting nonprofit legal services, that platform is often unavailable and usually ineffectual.\n\nOn April 16, 2014, the district court (Judge Edward M. Chen) granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. 300 F.R.D. 628. Then, on April 28, 2014, the court referred the case to Magistrate Judge Donna M. Ryu for settlement negotiations.\n\nSettlement discussions went on for over two years. During that time, the court approved an expansion of the plaintiff class on July 27, 2015. 308 F.R.D. 203. That expansion included detainees at newly-constructed detention facilities in California. The plaintiffs filed a supplemental complaint on August 27, 2015, which included allegations against telephone policies in the new facilities.\n\nOn March 18, 2016, the court ruled that the detainees had no Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and that the telephone policies did not violate the plaintiffs’ statutory rights to counsel. 171 F. Supp. 3d 961. However, the court allowed the due process and First Amendment claims to proceed.\n\nOn July 1, 2016, the court granted preliminary approval of the parties’ settlement agreement; on November 18, 2016, the court approved the settlement agreement and awarded attorneys’ fees in the amount of $405,000.\n\nWith this class-action settlement, restrictions on the detainees’ use of telephones were lifted such that they could make outgoing calls and ultimately obtain legal assistance. The terms of the preliminary settlement agreement included the following: <ol><li>Adding free and private numbers to housing unit telephones, eliminating automatic telephone cutoffs of 20 minutes, and extending cutoff times to 40 or 60 minutes,<li>Adding 40 phone booths and additional phone rooms in housing units to facilitate privacy,<li>Provisions ensuring timely access to phones and messages such as providing facilitators to process phone requests, and<li>Provisions for implementation of and compliance with the agreement.</ol>On April 23, 2019, the parties filed a proposed order to extend certain terms of the settlement agreement.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a lawsuit brought by the State of California regarding the July 2020 release of ICE regulations which, in effect, meant that students on F-1 visas would risk deportation if their school shifted to online learning. In a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance and as a result, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. California continued to monitor the alterations ICE made to its website between July and September and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on October 19, 2020. <hr>\n\n<b>Background</b>\nGenerally speaking, F-1 visas (colloquially \"student visas\") can be granted to international students who attend American universities. However, regulations on the granting of these visas limit the amount of online or distance learning the student can engage in. According to these regulations, an international student can engage in only one such class or three credits of that class per semester. 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G).\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 made this regulation untenable, as schools and universities had to shift to online learning systems. In response, defendant ICE issued an exemption on March 13, 2020, affirming that international students would be permitted to continue distance learning in the United States under their F-1 visas. The exemption would apply until the end of the emergency. However, on July 6, 2020, ICE issued a new directive stating that it would rescind that exemption. This directive would then mean that international students at schools that would still be fully online would have to either transfer to other schools that were at least partially in-person, go back to their countries voluntarily, or risk deportation. The directive also ordered schools that had gone fully online or had simply decided not to have classes to submit an \"operational change plan\" within nine days, and ordered schools that would have a hybrid system to certify each F-1 student to make sure that they were not taking entirely online courses.\n\n<b>The Lawsuit</b>\nOn July 9, three days after the directive was issued, the State of California filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleged two violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). First, it argued that the directive was arbitrary and capricious because: 1) the defendants gave no explanation for the sudden shift in policy; 2) defendants relied on factors Congress did not intend for them to rely on in making the shift; 3) defendants failed to consider the reliance interests of students and universities after they had issued the original exemption; and 4) defendants failed to provide any cogent explanation for the shift in policy. Second, the state alleged that defendants did not go through proper notice-and-comment rulemaking processes when they issued the new directive. \n\nThe State of California sought declaratory relief that would call the new directive illegal, an order setting aside the July directive, and injunctive relief that would force defendants to reinforce the original March 13 exemption.\n\nCalifornia declined to have a magistrate judge conduct the proceedings. The next day, July 10, the case was assigned to Judge Jon S. Tigar.\n\nOn July 13, California submitted a motion requesting a preliminary injunction. The proposed injunction would prohibit the government from acting on the new directive. \n\nAlso on July 13, Regents of the University of California filed a motion to relate the case to <a href= \"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17680&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseName%7CRegents%20of%20the%20University%20of%20California%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B\">the case they had filed</a> in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California three days prior.

The plaintiffs brought their suit under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), implemented in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA).

{"document": "This case arose in response to President Trump's 2018 family separation policy. On April 6, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General announced a “zero-tolerance” immigration policy, which criminally prosecuted all adult entrants crossing the border without documentation, including asylum seekers accompanied by minor children. The Trump administration stated that its zero-tolerance policy was intended to reduce illegal border crossing, migration, and the burdens resulting from fraudulent asylum requests. However, enforcement of the zero-tolerance policy resulted in widely-publicized separation of children from their parents. Although the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) held authority over detainment of adult non-citizens, minor children were not permitted to be held in federal criminal detention facilities. Therefore, accompanying children were held separately under the guidelines of the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-CA-0002-0005.pdf\">Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA)</a>, which required the government to limit the time accompanied minors spent in detention to 20 days. In cases where the parents were not released in 20 days, minors were considered unaccompanied non-citizen children, under the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). \n\nPublic pressure prompted an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/trump-immigration-children-executive-order.html\">executive order</a> from President Trump, which mandated the DHS to maintain custody of immigrant families on June 20, 2018. This allowed immigrant parents and children apprehended at the border to remain together during the pendency of their criminal or immigration proceedings.\n\nOn June 20, 2018, three immigrant parents forcibly separated from their children filed a lawsuit against various immigration federal agencies and officials in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking immediate reunification with their children. Represented by Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, the plaintiffs alleged that family separation was a punishment in violation of Due Process and sought preliminary and permanent injunctions to immediately reunite with their children as well as declaratory relief. They also sought attorney fees. The case was initially assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, then re-assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman as he had an earlier related case. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs, all of whom entered the U.S. with accompanying children, crossed the US-Mexico border from Central America after the announcement of the zero-tolerance policy, prior to the issuance of the June 20 executive order. Plaintiff M.G.U. crossed the U.S.-Mexico border with her children, then presented herself with her children at the San Ysidro, California port of entry on May 4, 2018. Initially detained together with her children at the South Texas Family Residential Center (STFRC), Plaintiff M.G.U was moved to an adult detention facility from the STFRC due to a past criminal conviction. Her children were determined as non-citizen children without a suitable legal guardian, separated to be transported to New York in custody of the ORR. Plaintiff E.F. and Plaintiff A.P.F. were prosecuted for entering the U.S. without inspection after crossing the US-Mexico border with their children. In accordance with the Trafficking Victim Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), their children were similarly transferred to the custody of the ORR. \n\nOn June 22, 2018, the plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO), allowing them access to daily information on the children’s well-being as well as consistent communication with the children during the period of the separation. At the hearing held on June 27, 2018, the defendants claimed that most of the information requested by the plaintiffs was already available, or available upon request. Judge Friedman withheld the TRO application and suggested a joint status report between the plaintiffs and defendants. The parties submitted the joint status report on July 5, 2018, which resolved several issues. However, the parties could not reach an agreement on matters regarding communication between the plaintiffs and children, or the release of specific information on the location of Plaintiff E.F.’s child. On July 16, 2018, the Court granted the plaintiffs’ TRO for the matters above. \n\nMeanwhile, the plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction for immediate reunification with their children. A hearing was held on July 12, 2018, during which Plaintiff E.F. informed the Court that she was awaiting a review decision on a negative credible fear determination. A credible fear determination by an asylum officer determines whether an individual has reasonable fear of returning to their home country. If negative, the plaintiff would be removed, which risked Plaintiff E.F. being removed from the U.S. without her son. On July 13, 2018, an immigration judge had affirmed Plaintiff E.F.’s negative fear determination. For that reason, the Court prohibited defendants from removing Plaintiff E.F. from the U.S. prior to the preliminary injunction decision.\n\nMeanwhile, in another case, on June 26, 2018, Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California issued a class-wide preliminary injunction requiring reunification of children under the age of five with their parents by July 10, 2018, and children over the age of five by July 26, 2018. For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16620\">Ms. L v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>.\n\nOn July 18, 2018, Judge Friedman granted Plaintiff E.F.’s motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the defendants to reunite her with her 9-year-old son by July 20, 2018. Plaintiff M.G.U. and Plaintiff A.P.F. had been reunited with their children prior to the court order on July 11, 2018, and July 17, 2018, respectively. \n\nOn November 9, 2018, the defendants moved to dismiss the case because the plaintiffs' claims were based on the separation from their children, who were now united. Additionally, they asserted that there was no fundamental right of parents to be detained with their children while they were detained pursuant to a criminal charge.\n\nOn December 23, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to add two additional plaintiffs, plaintiffs P.M.B. and C.O.M., a mother subject to a final order of deportation, and daughter, whose asylum was pending. The mother and daughter were initially detained together near Dilley, Texas, but faced imminent separation, as the defendants argued that the proposed plaintiff was not a class member because the family had not been forcibly separated previously. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed for an emergency TRO to preserve the status quo detention of P.M.B. and C.O.M., preventing their separation, which was granted on December 24, 2018. On January 26, 2019, the defendants released the proposed plaintiffs from detention to lawfully pursue immigration relief in the U.S., subject to an ankle monitor. Since releasing C.O.M. and P.M.B., the defendants indicated they no longer had intent to separate the plaintiffs while they pursued immigration relief. Consequently, Plaintiffs sought dissolution of the TRO and withdrew their motions without prejudice. On February 19, 2019, the court granted the plaintiff's motion. \n\nOn July 19, 2019, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case. The case is now closed. \n", "summary": "On June 20, 2018, three immigrant parents separated from their children filed a civil action against various federal agencies and officials in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for immediate reunification with their children.The plaintiffs were detained after crossing the United States-Mexico border without inspection with young accompanying children, seeking asylum. After plaintiffs were apprehended at the border, the children were separated under the “zero-tolerance” immigration policy announced April 6, 2018, which criminally prosecuted adult entrants crossing the border illegally and placed accompanying minors in custody of the government. All three plaintiffs crossed the border prior to the Executive Order issued on June 20, 2018, which allowed immigrant parents and children apprehended at the border to remain together during the pendency of their proceedings. The plaintiffs alleged interference of family integrity in violation of Due Process, and sought preliminary and permanent injunctions to immediately reunite plaintiffs with their children. The plaintiffs obtained preliminary relief and were (along with another parent who joined the case later to prevent separation from her daughter) ultimately re-united with their children. The case is now closed."}

The plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\">denied class certification</a> on January 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David v.

The complaint alleged violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. §1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. §1590 (trafficking)) and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. §1981), as well as claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. The plaintiffs were represented by private law firms. \n\nPlaintiffs were allegedly brought into the United States to provide labor and services to the defendant, Signal International, a company based in Pascagoula, Mississippi with operations in the Gulf Coast region, in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs. The complaint alleged that the plaintiffs paid Signal's recruiters as much as $25,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States found out they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, plaintiffs were forced to pay additional fees ($1050 per month) to live in racially segregated labor camps, and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. \n\nOn Oct. 17, 2013, the District Court (Judge Robert H.

{"document": "In early 2015, six refugees filed this class action lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York (Judge David Hurd). The plaintiffs sued the Utica School District under the Declaratory Relief Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, claiming violations of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C § 1703; Section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq.; New York Education Law § 3202(1); the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause; the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause; and the New York State Constitution’s Due Process Clause.\n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union, alleged that the defendants consistently denied Utica residents between the ages of 17 and 20 who were limited English proficient (LEP) and immigrants access to educational opportunity. Defendants diverted this largely refugee population to alternative education programs rather than allowing them to enroll at the only public high school in Utica. The alternative education programs provided either only English as a Second Language (ESL) classes or a combination of ESL and GED classes, both of which provided a substantially inferior education to normal high school courses. When students inquired as to the reason for the diversion, defendants indicated that the students were too old to enroll in the high school. In fact, under New York law, individuals have a right to attend high school until they reach age 21. The plaintiffs sued for declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe case was litigated for several months, and after mandatory mediation did not result in a settlement, litigation continued until early 2016 when the parties commenced settlement negotiations. \n\nOn June 3, 2016, Judge Hurd ordered a consent decree stipulating the terms of the settlement between the parties.

{"document": "This is a class action suit about bond hearings for detainees under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The issue is whether due process under the Fifth Amendment allows the government to place the burden of proof for whether the person being detained poses a flight risk (and therefore shouldn't be released) on the detainee themselves. Another issue is whether Immigration Judges are required by the INA or Department of Justice regulations to consider the detainee's ability to pay bond and possible alternatives to bond at bond hearings under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).\n\nThe case was brought on behalf of people detained under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)) at the Batavia Federal Detention Facility in upstate New York, as well as a subclass of people who are detained in Richwood, LA but have their hearings in front of judges at the Buffalo/Batavia immigration court. On March 10, 2020, the case was filed by two civil immigration detainees held under § 1226(a) pending their removal proceedings; they were represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union (an ACLU affiliate). The presiding judge is Elizabeth A Wolford, in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. Plaintiffs filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2241, alleging violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Fifth Amendment. Claims were also asserted on behalf of class members who had been denied bond before particular Immigration Judges who allegedly had a policy of not granting bond hearings or alternatives to detention in most cases. \n\nIn a September 2020 order, Judge Wolford denied class certification for the post-hearing class , but granted Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion as to the main pre-bond hearing class in September and found that plaintiffs had stated a Due Process Claim that the government is required to bear the burden of proof at bond hearings for individuals detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1226(a). The court partially denied Plaintiffs’ sub-class claims and partially granted Defendents' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction for the claims regarding the no-bond policy on the ground that Plaintiffs had not named the warden of the Richwood detention center as a defendant. Finally, Judge Wolford rejected Plaintiffs’ claim that the INA required Immigration Judges consider non-bond alternatives to detention or the ability of detainees to pay, but found that Plaintiffs had stated a claim for violation of the INA on different grounds – namely, that the Immigration Judge at one plaintiff’s bond hearing had stated she was unable to consider alternatives to money bond.\n\nIn late September 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration relating to the issues they had lost,. Before this was acted upon, defendants filed a notice of appeal for the portion of the September decision and order that granted, in part, the preliminary injunction. (483 F. Supp. 3d 159).\n\nIn a decision and order dated March 29, 2021, Judge Wolford rejected Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration. Later in April, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal regarding the September order and partial denial of the preliminary injunction. The appeal remains pending and the case remains ongoing.\n", "summary": "In 2020, two immigration detainees in the Batavia Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, NY, filed this class action in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York.

The court granted relief for pre-hearing detainees, agreeing that they pled sufficient facts to state a Due Process Claim that the government is required to bear the burden of proof at bond hearings for individuals detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1226(a).

{"document": "On May 26, 2015, a group of parents and guardians of children born in Texas, and a nonprofit advocacy organization, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Represented by Texas RioGrande Legal Aid and the Texas Civil Rights Project, the plaintiffs sued the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe plaintiffs, all Mexican citizens, asked for the release of certified copies of their U.S.-citizen children's birth certificates. The defendant had, according to the plaintiffs, recently changed longstanding regulations and was now refusing to accept official Mexican-issued identification (<i>matricula consular</i>) as proof of parents' identity and relationship with their children. Consequently, lacking birth certificates for their children, the plaintiffs could not prove their children's U.S. citizenship nor their parent-child relationships.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the defendant was discriminating on the basis of national origin and only withholding the birth certificates because of the parents' immigration status and national origin. Further, the plaintiffs maintained, the defendants were interfering with exclusive federal authority over matters involving immigrants' documentation and diplomatic affairs with consulates issuing identity documents. Thus, the plaintiffs alleged, the defendant's actions violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Further, the plaintiffs alleged violations of the Texas State Administrative Procedures Act.\n\nOn July 22, DSHS moved to dismiss the complaint, claiming a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of state sovereign immunity, and failure to state a claim under the requirements of § 1983, preemption doctrine, and the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs responded on August 5, arguing that this case properly stated jurisdiction and a valid claim; the defendant replied on August 13.\n\nOn August 21, the plaintiffs moved for an emergency preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs argued that, without the birth certificates, the parents and children would suffer irreparable harm by being unable to access rights such as education, housing, and healthcare, to protect the children from deportation, to maintain family unity, and to ensure the children's ability to freely travel between other countries and the United States.\n\nHowever, on October 16, 2015, Judge Pitman denied the plaintiffs' request for emergency application for a temporary injunction. Judge Pitman found that, although the plaintiffs had met the burden of showing irreparable harm to the children (\"it simply begs credulity for Defendants to argue a birth certificate is not a vitally important document\"), the plaintiffs had not demonstrated they would likely succeed on the merits. Regarding the Fourteenth Amendment claim, the state interest in preventing fraud in birth certificates might be found to justify disfavor of Mexican-consular identity documents. The plaintiffs had not shown they were likely to prevail on the preemption claim, because the state policy did not facially preempt federal immigration policy, and the state had a compelling interest in regulating birth certificates. 2015 WL 6118623 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 16, 2015).\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint on Mar. 29, 2016, adding additional plaintiffs from Mexico and Central America. Some parents possessed no acceptable documents, while some had presented one acceptable document but had been denied a birth certificate anyway. \n\nThe parties soon entered mediation and reached a private settlement agreement on July 22, 2016. According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/us/lawsuit-texas-immigrants-birth-certificates.html?_r=0\">news reports</a>, Texas agreed to accept some identity documents that it had been rejecting, including Mexican voter identification cards presented with secondary identification. Parents from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras could also present consulate-issued documents. Texas also established a review process for rejected birth certificate applications and training for registrar officials issuing the certificates. The Court set a compliance monitoring period of nine months.\n\nThe Court dismissed the case with prejudice on May 9, 2017. This case is now closed.", "summary": "In May 2015, parents of children born in Texas sued the Texas Department of State Health Services.

On June 6, Judge Garcia, consolidated the three other cases, with El Cenizo becoming the lead case in the consolidation. This case, however, remains separate.\n\n<b>Summary of this litigation</b>\nOn May 7, 2017, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed this suit seeking a declaratory judgment approving SB4. Defendants are Travis County, City of Austin, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF). In their complaint, the plaintiffs accused defendants of being \"openly hostile\" to cooperation with federal immigration officials both in policy and in practice. Judge Sam Sparks was assigned to the case. \n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on May 24, 2017. They argued that the state filed the suit prior to SB4 going into effect and that it had suffered no direct injury. That same day, the state filed a motion to consolidate this case with the  City of El Cenizo case. \n\nOn May 31, 2017, Texas filed an amended complaint, adding its Attorney General as a new plaintiff, and many of the City of El Cenizo plaintiffs as defendants in this case, including the League of Latin American Citizens (LULAC), El Paso County, and the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund. 2017 WL 9362209 (W.D.Tex.). In response, the defendants filed amended motions to dismiss on June 2, 2017. \n\nThe state voluntarily dismissed MALDEF from the case on June 16, 2017. On June 28, 2017, defendants filed motions to dismiss on the grounds that Texas lacked standing. The next day, the city of El Paso filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n\nThe court dismissed the case without prejudice on August 9, 2017, finding that Texas lacked actual or imminent injury, which was required for Article III standing to seek declaratory judgment. 272 F.Supp.3d 973 (W.D. Tex. 2017). The court wrote that \"[t]he State's alleged injury turns on the legal consequences of some act that may or may not occur - that is, Defendants' decision to violate the law. The State has produced no evidence that at the time of filing suit, it was clear Defendants planned to violate the law once it takes effect. Expressing public disagreement with a law does not constitute a violation of the law, nor does articulating the desire to challenge the constitutionality of the law equate to a violation of it.\" Id. at 980. The court noted that its holding was in line with a well-established ban on advisory opinions, and that do otherwise would be to “'open a Pandora's box and invite every local government to seek a court's judicial blessing' on a law prior to it taking effect.\" Id. \n\nTexas appealed the dismissal to the Fifth Circuit on Aug. 31, 2017. On May 25, 2018, the Fifth Circuit granted MALDEF's motion to dismiss itself as a party in the case. \n\nOn December 12, 2018, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the claim after full briefing and oral argument. 910 F.3d 809 (5th Cir. 2018). Judge Stephen A. Higginson, writing for a three-judge panel, affirmed this case's dismissal.

{"document": "On May 3, 1993, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) notified Harrison County, Mississippi of its intention to investigate conditions of the county jail under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. 1997 et seq. Following the investigation, the DOJ sent a letter notifying the president of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors of its findings. The DOJ found there were too few staffed officers per inmates and significant deficiencies in the officers' training. These underlying problems lead to excessive discipline of inmates, lack of access to legal materials, and unsecured dangerous objects, including kitchen knives and prescription medication. The DOJ also found the suicide prevention program, as well as general medical and mental health care of the inmates, to be inadequate. The DOJ findings letter then made recommendations as to the minimum remedial measure needed to meet constitutional standards.  \n\nNegotiations led to settlement; the Attorney General filed a CRIPA action against the jail on January 6, 1995.  Although it is not mentioned in the docket sheet, presumably the parties provided the court with their proposed consent decree. Six days later, Judge Walter J. Gex III approved a consent decree, which laid out steps the county must take to improve issues discussed in the DOJ's letter of findings and recommendations.  \n\nThe consent decree mandated that the county double the number of officers per shift, have a female officer on duty at all times. The officers were to have 80 hours of training before starting their employment, with 40 hours of training per year thereafter. The decree prohibited using the 'strip cells', or cells without amenities, to house inmates. The county was also required to implement procedures that identified and properly stored dangerous materials and open a law library that was accessible at least eight hours a day, five days a week. For medical care, the county agreed to hire a medical professional and to both screen and monitor the inmates health. The county also agreed to hire a psychologist on at least a half-time basis and develop a suicide prevention program. The county was given one year to be in compliance with this decree. \n\nOn November 4, 1996, the county sheriff submitted a report, claiming substantial compliance with the consent decree. On April 15, 1999, the case was placed on the inactive docket of the court. \n\nIn 2000 two inmates from the county jail sent the court letters claiming the constitutional rights were continuing to be violated. The court dismissed these petitions, but the county jail restarted submitting status reports regarding the conditions of the jail. \n\nOn May 28, 2003, the DOJ filed a motion for an order to show cause why defendants should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with the 1995 consent decree. On March 23, 2004, Judge Walter J. Gex III held a hearing regarding the motion. Judge Gex ultimately determined to stay the issue of contempt, predicated on the defendants' agreement to allocate funds towards the jail and hire certain numbers of additional staff to address the concerns raised in the DOJ's motion. This defendants were also required to continue to file status reports regarding the facility quarterly.  \n\nThroughout the next ten years, Judge Walter J. Gex III issued several minute orders requiring the defendants to be more thorough in their status reports.\n\nOn May 9, 2014, the case was reassigned to Chief District Judge Louis Guirola, Jr. \n\nOn August 11, 2015, the parties filed a joint motion for dismissal, citing increased physician, psychiatrist, and mental health staffing; the creation of a chronic care program; and implementation of new auditing and quality assurance mechanisms. In the motion, the defendants stated that they would continue to use their best efforts to make progress in their auditing, their peer review of medical services, policies and practices, and to appoint a specific representative for persons with mental illnesses whose job would be to advocate for alternatives to institutionalization and seek funding for mental health services. \n\nJudge Louis Guirola, Jr. terminated the 1995 consent decree and dismissed the case with prejudice the next day. \n", "summary": "On May 3, 1993, the U.S. Department of Justice investigated the Harrison County, MI jail.

They alleged that the Erie County Sheriff's Department had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all individuals who entered either the Erie County Holding Center or the Erie County Correctional Facility, regardless of the crime charged and without reasonable suspicion that the individuals were concealing weapons or contraband.  The plaintiffs alleged that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and class certification.  \n\nThe parties engaged in contentious discovery, resulting in numerous discovery motions and request for sanctions.  District Judge John T. Curtin and Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott made numerous unpublished rulings on these issues.  See, e.g., Pritchard v. County of Erie, 2006 WL 1455484 (W.D. N.Y.

The plaintiffs requested that the Court certify this action as a money damages class action under Rule 23(b)(3). In the alternative, the plaintiffs sought partial certification under Rule 23(c)(4). The court held in favor plaintiff and found that all the requirements for class certification had been met. 269 F.R.D. 213, 219.

The plaintiffs argued that the strip searches in <i>Florence</i> were private, individual searches, while the searches in this case were in groups.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a habeas action filed by individuals in the Shelby County Jail who alleged that their underlying medical conditions made them especially vulnerable to COVID-19. They alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act and requested release. The court denied both preliminary relief and motions to dismiss. The parties moved for preliminary approval of class action settlement, which was granted on January 28, 2021. A final approval hearing is scheduled for March 5, 2021.<hr>\n\nTwo individuals with medical conditions that rendered them especially vulnerable to COVID-19 filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus on May 20, 2020 against the Shelby County Sheriff's Office in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. They sought to represent a class of Shelby County Jail detainees with disabilities or who were medically vulnerable to COVID-19. Represented by lawyers from the ACLU as well as private counsel, they alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 et seq.), and the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 701). \n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs alleged that conditions in the jail, like housing detainees in close proximity to one another, constituted a failure to provide reasonable safety as well as unlawful punishment of pretrial detainees. They also claimed that defendants were violating the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because they had not made reasonable modifications to their policies to avoid discriminating against detainees with disabilities, who were particularly likely to be affected by COVID. Judge Sheryl H. Lipman was assigned the case. \n\nSimultaneously with the initial petition, plaintiffs sought class certification, a temporary restraining order (TRO) or writ of habeas corpus that would immediately release the named plaintiffs, and a TRO, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction and/or writ of habeas corpus that would create a process by which class members could be released. Plaintiffs filed a motion to expedite consideration of the TRO and preliminary injunction.\n\nThe following day, Judge Lipman granted the motion to expedite consideration of the TRO and preliminary injunction, instructing defendants to file a response by May 26. Defendants did so, filing a motion to dismiss, a response in opposition to the motion for class certification, and a response in opposition to the motion for a temporary restraining order. Defendants' responses indicated that they had a thorough process for dealing with COVID-19 and were trying to decrease the population of the jail. \n\nBy June 10, Judge Lipman issued an order denying defendant's motion for dismissal. She explained that habeas relief was properly sought because plaintiffs challenged the \"fact,\" not conditions, of confinement. Judge Lipman also denied in part and granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The court granted class certification but narrowed its scope. The certified class consisted of detainees (1) age 65 or older; or with (2) chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma; (3) serious heart conditions; (4) immunodeficiencies; (5) severe obesity; (6) diabetes; (7) chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis; (8) chronic liver disease; or (9) hemoglobin disorders. The court also certified a subclass defined as \"All persons currently or in the future held at the Jail in pretrial custody during the COVID19 pandemic who are at increased risk of COVID-19 complications or death because of disabilities as defined in the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\" 2020 WL 3108713.\n\nTwo days later, Judge Lipman addressed the motion for a temporary restraining order. She found that the factual record was not developed enough to rule and ordered the parties to agree on an \"Independent Inspector\" who would visit the jail and report back to the court.  \n\nA few days later, plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint which added two more named plaintiffs. \n\nMeanwhile, by June 18 the parties had settled on Michael K. Brady as Independent Inspector. The Inspector filed his report on June 30, 2020. He found that the jail was run by \"consummate professionals\" but still needed to make several adjustments to ensure the safety of its detainees, including issuing additional masks, improving sanitation, and sequestering new arrivals and high-risk detainees. \n\nOn June 30, defendants submitted another motion to dismiss, this time targeting plaintiffs’ amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. \n\nThe court denied the motion on July 24, 2020. Judge Lipman criticized defendants' \"needless filing\" of a second motion to dismiss. She noted that defendants' arguments either had been raised and rejected in the first motion to dismiss or should have been raised in the earlier motion. Judge Lipman then rejected the new arguments on the merits because (1) pretrial detainees can bring unconstitutional punishment claims; (2) neither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act required proof of discriminatory intent; and (3) habeas relief was available for detainees alleging that their continued detention violated the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. 2020 WL 4668756. \n\nOn August 7, the court rejected plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief and habeas relief. Judge Lipman noted that habeas relief was only available if plaintiffs showed that it was impossible for the jail to detain them in compliance with the Constitution, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act. But she found that \"any shortcomings are remediable,\" while acknowledging continuing concerns about the lack of social distancing, testing, and quarantine at the jail. 2020 WL 4668757.\n\nOn September 15, 2020, plaintiffs moved to modify class certification and file a second amended petition for habeas corpus, alleging that defendants had \"temporarily made improvements to certain conditions, apparently in preparation for the inspections by court-appointed inspector,\" but those improvements \"lapsed shortly after the inspections occurred,\" as well as adding additional named plaintiffs, and including a more detailed request for injunctive relief. \n\nAfter attending mediation, on December 28, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement, and on January 22, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a joint motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement. \n\nOn January 28, the court preliminarily granted the motion, which are to be approved by the class and subclass. The consent decree stated that the defendants must provide the Inspector and plaintiffs with a monthly report that details the population of the jail, number of COVID-19 tests conducts for detainees and staff, number of staff on leave in the past 30 days due to COVID-19 symptoms, number of detainees who died and exhibited symptoms of or tested positive for COVID-19 prior to death, and type of housing for class and subclass members.

The plaintiffs, represented by Columbia Legal Services, claimed that jail officials’ excessive use of force and the jail’s squalid living conditions violated the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. They asked the Court to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the County from permitting such abuses.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that jail staff regularly utilized restraint chairs and chained detainees to fixed objects for long periods of time, pepper sprayed detainees without cause or proper supervision, and locked detainees in segregation or isolation without cause and in inhumane conditions for up to 23 hours per day. The plaintiffs also claimed that jail officials seized detainees’ property without notice or cause, denied detainees outdoor exercise, and prohibited detainees from visiting with friends and family. Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that the County did not provide any educational services, programming, or religious services for detainees. As a result, the plaintiffs suffered emotional, physical and psychological injuries.\n\nOn August 5, 2014, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order barring the County from chaining detainees to fixed objects.

Bastian denied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs failed to make an adequate showing of immediate irreparable harm and because they sought to alter, rather than preserve, the status quo. \n\nOn January 12, 2015, Judge Bastian referred the case to Magistrate Judge James P. Hutton for a settlement conference. Then, on December 16, 2015, Judge Bastian referred the case to Magistrate Judge John T.

On March 16, 2016, Judge Bastian granted the joint motion.\n\nOn March 28, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class for the purposes of settlement and for preliminary approval of settlement. They requested that the court certify a settlement class defined as “All individuals who are now, or in the future will be, detained in the Franklin County Correctional Center during the term of the parties’ Settlement Agreement.” \n\nThe settlement agreement required a three year term during which the defendant would be monitored by an independent third party to ensure compliance. The agreement required the defendant to hire additional staff, enter into a new contract for medical services, renovate and repair parts of the jail, adopt new policies, end a 23-hour lockdown policy and other practices, and train jail staff on these new policies and procedures.

{"document": "For the complete Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA Matters, see our <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20\">special collection</a>.<hr>This case involves a dispute over administrative subpoenas known as National Security Letters (NSLs). In 1986, Congress empowered the FBI to issue NSLs as part of authorized investigations to protect against international terrorism and clandestine intelligence activities. NSLs are directed to electronic communications service providers in order to obtain specified limited information; they are not used to obtain the content of communications. Because of national security interests, the NSL statute imposes a nondisclosure obligation on the NSL recipient. In 2006, Congress revised the nondisclosure provisions in order to avoid unnecessary disclosure restrictions: the nondisclosure requirement no longer applied automatically, and Congress provided a specific statutory mechanism for judicial review of a nondisclosure requirement itself, separate from review of the NSL.\n\nIn 2011, the FBI issued a National Security Letter (NSL) to an unnamed electronic communication service provider, seeking certain subscriber information. By certifying that the disclosure of the existence of the NSL may result in \"a danger to the national security of the United States,\" the federal government could prohibit the provider from disclosing the existence of the NSL. This entry describes the lawsuits between the recipient and government that arose from this NSL and subsequent NSLs issued to the same recipient. \n\nIn early 2011, the NSL recipient filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to set aside the NSL under 18 U.S.C. § 3511. The recipient, represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the nondisclosure provision in the NSL Statute (18 U.S.C. § 2709) violated the First Amendment. More specifically, the recipient argued that the nondisclosure provision of the statute was an unconstitutional prior restraint and content-based restriction on speech, both on its face and as applied. \n\nThe federal government opposed the petition and filed a motion to compel the recipient to comply with the NSL. The government also filed a separate lawsuit seeking a declaration that the recipient was required to comply with the NSL on June 3, 2011 (No. 11-2667). We have an incomplete docket for the government's declaratory judgment action and no docket for the original case—it's entirely under seal.\n\nOn March 14, 2013, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston granted the petition to set aside the NSL, declaring that 18 U.S.C. § 2709 on its face violated the First Amendment. She noted that § 2709 allowed the government to suppress speech without initiating prompt judicial proceedings and determined that the law was not narrowly tailored because it prevented NSL recipients from disclosing not just the content of NSLs but also their very existence. So, she enjoined the government from issuing additional NSLs or enforcing § 2709's nondisclosure provision in any case. 930 F. Supp. 2d 1064.  \n\nThe government appealed, and the district court stayed proceedings during the appeal on August 7, 2013. \n\nDespite the court's March 14 order, the government issued two new NSLs to the recipient of the original NSL. The recipient filed another lawsuit to challenge the new NSLs (No. 13-80089). On August 12, 2013, Judge Illston refused to set aside the new NSLs pending the appeal because they included procedural safeguards. For example, the FBI notified the recipient that judicial review was available and agreed to produce upon challenge evidence of a \"good reason\" that nondisclosure was required to protect against terrorism. \n\nAround the same time, other electronic communication service providers began to challenge NSLs. For more information on these cases, see <a href=https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14108>here</a>. \n\nBefore the Ninth Circuit could decide the appeal in this case, Congress amended both 18 U.S.C. § 2709 and 18 U.S.C. § 3511 as part of the USA FREEDOM Act on June 2, 2015. In light of the significant changes to the statutes, the Ninth Circuit vacated Judge Illston's order and remanded the case on August 24, 2015.\n\nOn March 19, 2016, Judge Illston found that Congress's revisions cured the NSL process's constitutional defects. The revised § 2709 allowed NSL recipients to require the government to seek judicial review of nondisclosure requirements, and the revised § 3511 required courts to \"rule expeditiously\" when reviewing NSL nondisclosure requirements. Moreover, the government would bear the burden of proof in the subsequent proceedings and had to provide specific facts to support a claim that disclosure could cause harm. Finally, the new § 3511 allowed the FBI and courts to authorize limited disclosures, which showed that the statute was narrowly tailored. \n\nThe court then analyzed whether nondisclosure was appropriate for the challenged NSLs. It found that the government adequately supported nondisclosure in case 11-2173 but not 13-80089, and it stayed its ruling pending appeal. The government then voluntarily lifted the nondisclosure requirement in case 11-2173. As a result, the recipient was able to reveal itself as CREDO Mobile. (Information about specific customer accounts remained undisclosed in all cases.) \n\nThe Ninth Circuit (Judges Sandra S. Ikuta, N. Randy Smith, and Mary H. Murguia) affirmed the district court's decision on July 17, 2017. The court found that § 2709's nondisclosure requirement was content based, applied strict scrutiny, and upheld the restrictions because § 2709 required the government to establish a reasonable likelihood that harm would result from disclosure on a case-by-case basis. The court then questioned whether § 2709 was a prior restraint but concluded, assuming it was, that the law passed muster because it provided quick judicial review. 863 F.3d 1110. \n\nThe Clearinghouse does not know if CREDO Mobile continues to seek disclosure of those parts of the NSLs that have not already been made public. \n", "summary": "In early 2011, an electronic communication service provider that had received a National Security Letter (NSL) from the federal government filed a petition to set aside the NSL in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The recipient asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that a nondisclosure provision of the NSL Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2709, violated the First Amendment. On March 14, 2013, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston granted the petition to set aside the NSL, declaring that § 2709 violated the First Amendment. The government was therefore enjoined from issuing NSLs under § 2709 or from enforcing the nondisclosure provision in this or any other case. The government appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, but while the appeal was pending, Congress amended § 2709 and 18 U.S.C. § 3511 as part of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. The district court and Ninth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the revised § 2709 and § 3511. But the district court held that the government failed to justify nondisclosure in one case involving the recipient, and the government found that nondisclosure was no longer required in another case involving the recipient. As a result, the recipient could reveal itself as CREDO Mobile. "}
{"document": "On May 14, 2014, the plaintiff, a freelance investigative reporter, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sued the National Security Agency (NSA) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, alleged that the defendants violated the Freedom of Information Act by improperly withholding records concerning the NSA's collection of metadata of judges within the federal judiciary, failing to conduct an adequate search for such records, and failing to grant his requests for a fee waiver. The plaintiff sought both injunctive relief and damages.\n\nOn September 26, 2014, the DOJ and NSA moved for summary judgment. On July 31, 2015, U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion for summary judgment. She held that while the defendants made a good faith effort search both their facilities and records systems for the requested information, they \"failed to conduct an adequate search and adequately explain the basis of their search in certain limited respects.\"  Judge Chutkan ordered them to search again through NSA directives and the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel's draft legal memoranda. Thus, there were still material issues of fact. 118 F. Supp. 3d 302.\n\nThe defendants completed the new searches and subsequently moved again for summary judgment on October 14, 2015. On July 11, 2016, Judge Chutkan denied the defendants' motion, holding that simply asking two senior attorneys in the Office of Legal Counsel whether they were \"aware of any projects OLC projects concerning the propriety of surveilling federal or state judges\" did not provide a reasonable basis for concluding that OLC was unlikely to possess responsive records. Judge Chutkan further held that the defendants did not establish that it would be unduly burdensome for them to search the emails of departing OLC attorneys for any draft memoranda or opinions concerning such surveillance program. 196 F.Supp.3d 67.\n\nJudge Chutkan directed the parties to submit another status report and scheduling order by October 11, 2016.

{"document": "On May 8, 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union (\"ACLU\") of Washington filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the Western District of Washington. The ACLU sued the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the DOJ to disclose and release records describing the operation and maintenance of the the National Crime Information Center Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File, which was maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), a component of the DOJ. \n\nThe National Crime Information Center (\"NCIC\"), a nationwide clearinghouse of reports operated by the FBI, provides direct online access to its computerized index of criminal justice information for local, state, federal, and tribal law enforcement officers, government agencies, financial institutions, prospective employers, etc. This database includes a Violent Gang and Terrorist Organizations File (\"VGTOF\"), which contains entries on suspected terrorist organizations and individuals. In 2003, there were over 7,000 individuals listed on the VGTOF as terrorists, though many of them had no criminal records. The ACLU was concerned that this could lead to grave ramifications, for instance, during a traffic stop where after running someone's credentials, the officer is alerted to the individual's status on the VGTOF and warned to approach that person with extreme caution. The VGTOF warning also instructs the officer to call the Terrorist Screening Center immediately and a number is provided on the officer's screen. The Terrorist Screening Center sends back one of four responses to the officer: \"arrest, detain, investigate, or query.\" There is no option for letting the individual go among these responses. \n\nIn a 2005 test conducted by the Terrorist Screening Center, the VGTOF was found to contain a 40% error rate, most of which were in the portion of the database that instructs officers how to approach and interact with individuals who have entries in the VGTOF. On December 19, 2008, the ACLU sent a letter to the FBI submitting a Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request for \"any record held by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation describing the operation and maintenance of the National Crime Information Center Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File.\" Though the ACLU received a letter dated January 5, 2006 indicating that the FBI received it's request, the FBI never followed up or provided any records requested by the ACLU. As a result, the ACLU filed this 2009 lawsuit claiming that the FBI violated it's rights under the Freedom of Information Act by failing to disclose and release the requested records. \n\nOn June 18, 2010, the DOJ filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that it had conducted an adequate search for the requested documents, and properly withheld records and portions of records under applicable exemption under the Freedom of Information Act in order to protect classified information. On March 10, 2011, U.S. District Court Judge Robert S. Lasnik granted the DOJ summary judgment in part, but ordered the DOJ to edit any inappropriate redactions and provide more facts that would justify redacting or not providing a certain document. \n\nOn March 24, 2011, the DOJ filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion to stay the Court's order on their motion for summary judgment. On May 19, 2011, the Court granted the DOJ's motion for reconsideration in part, requiring that after the DOJ supplemented the Vaughn index regarding the documents discussed in sections 1, 4, and 5, the parties would attempt to resolve their differences regarding production of these documents. If the parties were unable to reach agreement, plaintiff could, within thirty days of production of the revised Vaughn index, file a supplemental memorandum to assist the Court during in camera review of the contested documents.\n\nOn May 24, 2011, the DOJ filed a second motion for reconsideration questioning the Court's jurisdiction to review a designation by TSA, which was granted on June 20, 2011. On June 22, 2011, the DOJ filed the supplemental Vaughn Declarations, and on July 6, 2011, submitted documents for in camera review. \n\nOn September 21, 2012, Judge Lasnik issued an order following in camera review, which required the DOJ to make certain disclosures. On October 1, 2012, the DOJ filed a third motion for reconsideration, claiming that it had further evidence to present the Court as to why exemption 1 applies to document numbers 79, 80, and 84. The Court granted the DOJ's motion for reconsideration to allow the DOJ to deliver to chambers an <i>ex parte</i> declaration addressing applicability of the exemption to these documents. \n\nShortly thereafter, the parties began negotiations for settlement. On March 7, 2013, they agreed upon a Stipulation and Proposed Order for Compromise Settlement and Release of Claims.

Plaintiffs sought expeditious disclosure of the Bureau’s plans for digitization, reaching “hard-to-count” populations, hiring practices, and other preparations for the 2020 census, as well as a declaration that plaintiffs were entitled to a full fee waiver and an award of any costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

However, the Bureau claimed that it did not receive the request until July 6. Then, on August 7, the Bureau gave itself a month-long extension. The plaintiffs claimed the extension cited the wrong statute, failed to comply with the correct statute’s procedural requirements, and violated a 10-day limit for extensions. The Bureau then delayed an additional month due to purported lack of clarification on two of the requested items. On October 3, the Bureau sent “several internet links and four documents,” saying it would provide additional records on a rolling basis but failing at the time to disclose most of the requested documents. Additionally, the Bureau denied plaintiffs’ fee waiver request on the basis that plaintiffs were not an academic institution.\n\nOn March 7, 2018, plaintiffs submitted a second FOIA request that became included in the dispute.\n\nThe parties jointly filed a motion to meet and confer on March 19, 2018, which Judge Warren Eginton granted on March 21.

The plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Kentucky's laws prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying and voiding within Kentucky marriages of same-sex couples validly entered into under the laws of other states or countries.  \n\nOn August 16, 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding two more same-sex couples married under the laws of other states as plaintiffs in the suit. The plaintiffs asked the court for both declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that Amendment 223A of the Kentucky Constitution violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and that the Kentucky statutes KRS 402.045(2) and KRS 402.045(1) violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

It was unwilling to find a Constitutional basis to deny states' authority to define marriage.  On the Due Process and Equal Protection claims raised in this case, the court found that the bans were plausibly rational, and neither in violation of the Constitution nor due to illegal animus or discrimination.

The appeals court issued its decision on the first of these appeals on July 18, 2014, affirming the District Court's decision that same-sex marriage violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. The main opinion was by Judge Carlos Lucero; Judge Jerome Holmes joined, and Judge Paul Kelly dissented. The Court stayed its decision pending resolution of a petition for review in the Supreme Court. Bishop v. Smith, 2014 WL 3537847 (N.D. Oklahoma 2014).

The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from Texas RioGrande Legal Aid and Public Citizen Litigation Group asked the court for declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and litigation costs, claiming that the Department of Labor violated the Trade Act in its administration of job benefits by providing remedial education instead of bilingual vocational training sufficient to make participants job-ready upon completion. \n\nPlaintiiff Asociacion de Trabajadores Fronterizos (ATF) is a membership organization comprised of workers whose jobs were lost or threatened by foreign competition resulting from NAFTA. Its name translates to \"Association of Border Workers.\"  The members of ATF are primarily garment workers of Mexican national origin who communicate in Spanish and have limited English-communication abilities. The named plaintiffs Plaintiffs are members of ATF whose primary residences are in El Paso County, Texas. \n\nDefendant Department of Labor (DOL) is the federal agency responsible for administering the Trade Adjustment Assistance job training benefits to displaced workers provided for under the Trade Act of 1974. \n\nOn April 3, 2002, Plaintiffs, along with another party, first filed a lawsuit against the DOL that also named the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), the Upper Rio Grande Workforce Development Board, and the commissioners and directors of these organizations as defendants. This lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas El Paso Division, included the Trade Act violations in its causes of action.  This case is not in our database, but its docket number is 3:02-CV-00131. Judge Frank Montalvo severed the claims against the DOL on October 20, 2004 according to a motion by the plaintiffs. \n\nPrior to the severance, ATF filed a lawsuit on June 17, 2004, as the sole plaintiff, against the DOL under the Trade Act in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Following a hearing on the summary judgment motion on May 24, 2005, the case was referred to Judge Edward Leavy for mediation on June 03, 2005.  On December 29, 2005, upon completion of mediation, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to dismiss that included an executed copy of the settlement agreement reached by the parties. \n\nOn December 30, 2005, Judge Frank Montalvo granted Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss the case with prejudice and entered a final judgment. In the final judgment, the Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms the settlement agreement. The motion to dismiss, corresponding order and the final judgment were filed under this case and the original Texas case. Therefore, the other Texas case concluded with the same settlement agreement and closed on December 30, 2005. \n\nUnder the terms of the settlement agreement, the DOL and other defendants must dedicate $6 million in funding to establish a project for Limited English-Proficient (LEP) displaced workers in the El Paso Area. This program will make vocational training, customized training, on-the-job training and remedial education available to eligible participants. Policy changes included recognition of the effectiveness of, and a focus on, dual-language training and a required 80% wage replacement goal.  The DOL was also required to issue the Training and Employment Guidance letter within 30 days of the agreement.

The plaintiff filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the State of Arizona and the Arizona Department of Corrections. He alleged that the prison assigned him to a particular cell on the basis of his race, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The plaintiff alleged that the State of Arizona persisted in continuous and systematic racial segregation in the areas of housing and personal care of the prisoners. \n \nOn October 30, 2013, the judge assigned to this case, Judge Cindy A. Jorgenson, granted a motion by attorneys from the law firm Kendall, Brill, and Kelly to represent the plaintiff. Among those attorneys was Bert Deixler, who had litigated Johnson v.

On March 17, 2014, the Warden of the Arizona State Prison Complex-Tucson also filed a motion to dismiss alleging that the plaintiff improperly sued based on a letter mailed to him. \n\nThe plaintiff withdrew the claims against the Division Director of Offender Operation for the Arizona State Department of Corrections, and the Governor.

Pyle was chosen to oversee settlement negotiations. \n\nOn December 22, 2015, the parties notified the court that they had reached a settlement. Under the settlement, the defendants agreed to stop segregating prisoners by race in housing, except for in individual cases where a prisoner had a documented history of racial animosity. The defendants also agreed to curtail racially discriminatory practices in prison employment opportunities. They agreed to narrowly tailor any consideration of race in connection to employment assignments to address a compelling state interest, and to only ever consider race as one factor in a comprehensive and objective assessment of employment assignment or service. The change in policy would apply to Arizona Department of Corrections prison complexes in Douglas, Eyman, Florence, Lewis, Perryville, Phoenix, Safford, Tucson, Winslow, and Yuma. The defendants also agreed to pay $5,000 in monetary damages to the named plaintiff, and to pay $195,000 to the plaintiff's counsel in attorneys’ fees and costs. \n\nThe agreement was intended to last until at least 2023, and contained a clause prohibiting either party from moving to terminate the agreement during that period. The plaintiff’s counsel were designated as monitors over the defendants’ compliance with the terms of the agreement, and the defendants agreed to provide plaintiff’s counsel with documents, reports, and access to its facilities for monitoring purposes. In the event of a breach of the agreement, a process is in place to resolve the issue out of court first, after which the plaintiff’s counsel may seek court enforcement. The agreement bars the court from ordering the defendants to construct new prisons or to hire a specific number or type of staff unless the defendants propose to do so as part of a plan to remedy a failure to comply. \n\nOn February 8, 2016, Judge Jorgenson issued an order approving the settlement agreement, and agreeing to enforce its terms.

{"document": "On December 1, 2005, a group of California prisoners with mental illness filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. The prisoners filed against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. The prisoners, represented by the Legal Aid Society, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and private counsel, asked the court for both declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the prison system's policies regarding prisoners with mental disabilities violated the ADA. Specifically, the prisoners challenged the prison system's policies of 1) adding four classification points to any prisoner with mental illness; 2) preventing prisoners with mental illness from attending programming; 3) requiring that any prisoners taking specific medications be kept inside during yard when the temperature increased over 90 degrees; and 4) preventing prisoners with mental illness from taking jobs inside prison, among other allegations.  The case was assigned to Judge Lawrence Karlton. \n\n(The procedural history comes from Docket 124-3.)  Following the defendants' motion to dismiss, the relationship between this case and Coleman v. Brown came into issue. Coleman, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=573\">PC-CA-0002</a> in this Clearinghouse, was a class-action lawsuit filed by mentally ill California inmates under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against CDC alleging that mental health care provided at most California penal institutions violated their constitutional rights.  Coleman was also in front of Judge Karlton.  In this case, instead of ruling on the motion to dismiss (and before the prisoners were able to file a motion to certify the class,) on March 15, 2007, Judge Karlton referred the case to the special master of the Coleman case to make \"a report and recommendation as to whether the claims raised [in Hecker] can be resolved within the remedial phase of [Coleman].\" The case was stayed pending that report. 2007 WL 836806.\n\nOn June 12, 2007, the Coleman special master and the deputy special master gave their report and recommendation. The report concluded that the parties' were not able to \"negotiate[e] an agreement to consolidation or merger of the Hecker claims into the Coleman case at this time.\"  On December 14, 2007, the prisoners filed a motion to lift the stay. The Court did not rule on the motion. In the meantime, intense litigation proceeded in Coleman.  \n\nThe prisoners filed a renewed motion to lift the stay on September 19, 2012. On October 19, 2012, the Court denied the prisoners' motion without prejudice to its renewal, as appropriate, not later than March 1, 2013, and the parties were directed to meet and confer with the Coleman Special Master to determine whether any Hecker issues could be resolved in the Coleman remedial process. In the midst of that meet and confer process in January 2013 the state moved to terminate the Coleman case. Therefore, the parties were not able to agree to resolve Hecker issues within the Coleman remedial process.  (In the end, the Coleman termination motion was not granted.)\n\nOn March 1, 2013, the Hecker plaintiffs filed a renewed motion to lift the stay. On April 12, 2013, Magistrate Judge Dale A. Drozd denied the prisoners' motion \"without prejudice to its renewal, as appropriate, not later than September 5, 2013.\" He ordered the parties to continue to meet and confer with the Coleman Special Master, and directed that any renewed prisoners' motion to lift the stay be \"accompanied by a joint report by the parties and approved by the Coleman special master.\" \n\nIn July 2014, the parties reached a settlement.  Judge Karlton granted preliminary approval of the settlement on August 7, 2014, before retiring later that month.

The Settlement Agreement also provided that the implementation of these revised policies would be monitored by the Special Master appointed by the Court in Coleman. The Court in Coleman would also retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement.

{"document": "On September 9, 2014, Disability Rights Florida filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This suit was brought against the Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) and Wexford Health Sources, an FDC contractor, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), and the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiff, represented by private and in-house counsel as well as Florida Legal Services, asked the court for injunctive and declaratory relief. The plaintiff alleged that abuse and discrimination against inmates with mental illnesses as well as inadequate care for such inmates violated their Eighth Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that officials at Dade Correctional Institution (Dade CI) subjected inmates with serious mental illness in their inpatient mental health units to physical beatings, verbal harassment, deprivation of food, and torture. The plaintiff claimed that FDC was on notice of these conditions and failed to investigate the allegations of abuse and adequately punish those responsible. \n\nDisability Rights Florida, the plaintiff, is a federally-funded protection and advocacy system responsible for protecting the rights of individuals with mental illness in the state. In this lawsuit, the organization sought several forms of relief to protect prisoners with mental illnesses. First, the plaintiff requested that the court declare the defendants’ conduct unlawful and unconstitutional. Second, the plaintiff requested an injunction requiring FDC to cease all actions that violated the constitutional and statutory rights of mentally ill inmates at the Dade CI inpatient unit, to take immediate action to investigate and stop the ongoing abuse of such inmates, to train and supervise officers assigned to the unit, to develop a system of periodic independent oversight of the unit, and to take immediate steps to ensure timely investigations of abuse upon these inmates. Third, the plaintiff requested an injunction requiring Wexford to mandate that its employees report allegations of abuse and ensure that inmates with mental illness receive adequate care. Fourth and finally, the plaintiff requested an injunction requiring FDC to stop discriminating against inmates in the Dade CI inpatient unit on the basis of disability. \n\nAt around the same time, the estate and survivors of a mentally ill prisoner who died after being forced to shower in scalding water for hours sued FDC and several FDC guards and prison officials (<i>Chapman v. Florida Department of Corrections</i>, docket number 1:14-cv-24140-RNS).  The representative alleged that the defendants violated the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Eighth Amendment, and sought damages. On November 14, 2014, the court issued an order consolidating <i>Chapman</i> with this case. \n\nOn April 10, 2015, Disability Rights Florida and the defendants submitted a private settlement agreement that Judge Robert N. Scola, Jr. approved on April 14, 2015. Among other things, the state agreed to:<ul><LI>Provide Crisis Intervention Training to all staff at Dade CI. <li> Provide specialized training for correctional officers who work directly with inmates with mental illnesses. <li>Upgrade its video monitoring system and begin a pilot program for an audio monitoring system.<li>Try to provide full staffing at Dade CI.<li>Create an additional Assistant Warden position at Dade CI and a Mental Health Ombudsman position at FDC's central office and Region III office.  These officials will lead and supervise mental health care efforts.<li>Install televisions in the common areas of the inpatient units at Dade CI for both therapeutic and recreational activities. <li>Allow a team of psychiatrists and security experts to visit Dade CI to review records, observe therapeutic and non-therapeutic activities, evaluate safeguards against abuse and neglect at the facility, and make recommendations for any needed changes and improvements. </UL> In addition, Wexford Health Sources agreed to implement all of these provisions as well as provide training, hire additional behavioral health staff, and conduct internal and external audits of its program. The parties agreed to monitor compliance with the agreement through May of 2017. The court was to retain jurisdiction over the matter for 6 months, and during that time, the plaintiff could seek to reopen the case and resume the litigation if the state’s implementation of the agreement was systematically deficient. \n\nMeanwhile, on February 1, 2016, the plaintiff in <i>Chapman</i> moved to reopen the case, lift the stay on litigation entered with the settlement agreement, and start discovery because the settlement had no bearing on the issues addressed in its complaint.  The court, finding that <i>Chapman</i> should have automatically reopened on March 16, 2015 when the last stay expired, reopened the matter and ordered the defendants to respond to the complaint by April 4, 2016.\n\nOn April 12, 2016, the defendant answered the plaintiff’s complaint, raising several affirmative defenses, including failure to state a cause of action, failure to state a claim, and that the FDC was entitled to sovereign immunity. On May 16, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The FDC and Dade CI’s warden subsequently filed motions to dismiss on July 1, 2016. Meanwhile, discovery commenced. \n\nOn October 28, 2016, the court granted the FDC’s motion to dismiss while denying that of Dade CI’s warden. As to the warden, the court found that the plaintiffs had stated a plausible claim of supervisory liability based on the warden’s alleged knowledge of widespread abuse of mentally ill inmates at Dade CI. As to the FDC, the court dismissed the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought on behalf of the decedent’s surviving family members for lack of standing, but upheld the same claims as brought by his estate. \n\nDiscovery continued and, after fruitless mediation, a trial was scheduled for March 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Disability Rights Florida identified deficiencies in the defendants’ compliance with the settlement agreement. On May 19, 2017, it and FDC moved to extend the deadline by six months so that FDC could implement reforms, including hiring a different mental healthcare provider. At the end of the six-month extension, both parties asked the court to dismiss that portion of the consolidated case with prejudice. The court did so on November 8, 2017, but clarified that the dismissal did not affect the ongoing litigation between the estate and the FDC defendants. The court also retained jurisdiction to resolve any disputes over attorneys’ fees that might emerge. There is no evidence in the docket that any attorneys’ fees disputes with respect to the Disability Rights Florida litigation reached the court.\n\nHowever, on January 17, 2018, the remaining parties notified the court that they had settled the case privately and in full. The court ordered the case administratively closed that day. While the Clearinghouse is not aware of the terms of the new settlement agreement, subsequent litigation revealed that it included $4.5 million in monetary damages. \n\nOn May 24, 2018, the court entered an order requiring the plaintiffs to file a stipulation of dismissal by July 23, 2018. However, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers tried to put a charging lien on the pool of settlement funds, and the estate of one of the decedent’s relatives attempted to intervene to claim some of the proceeds. The court declined to address these new disputes, and after the lawyer voluntarily withdrew an Eleventh Circuit appeal on the lien issue, the court approved the settlement on October 26, 2018.\n\nOn November 21, 2018, the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal of the action. The same day, the court ordered the dismissal of the case and stated that the court reserves jurisdiction to enforce the parties’ settlement agreement.

{"document": "On August 3, 2016, a prisoner with a hearing disability incarcerated at Central State Prison in Georgia filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The plaintiff sued the Georgia Department of Corrections (GDOC) Commissioner, wardens, and counselors at his prison under 42 USC § 1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act, § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). The complaint alleged that the current TTY system at the GDOC was inaccessible, inoperable, outmoded, and obsolete. The plaintiff had been in prison for nine years, and during that time was unable to communicate with family, friends, and lawyers. Further, he alleged that he had no access to religion or education in his native language (American Sign Language). He claimed that he had exhausted all administrative avenues for relief, and that prison administrators had ignored or denied all of his requests. The plaintiff initiated the lawsuit pro se, but was later represented by the ACLU, the National Association of the Deaf, and private counsel. He sought injunctive relief in the form of inmate calling services, TTY, and/or VRS services. He also asked for $15 million in damages for pain and suffering as well as violation of his constitutional rights. The case was assigned to Judge Marc Thomas Treadwell and then referred to Magistrate Judge Stephen Hyles.\n\nThe plaintiff filed an amended complaint on January 26, 2017, adding several defendants but no new claims. On February 15, 2017 Magistrate Judge Hyles ordered that the plaintiff’s action could go forward against all named defendants. 2017 WL 1380511. The plaintiff was released from prison on February 18, 2017.

In the eighty-two paged proposed second amended complaint, the plaintiff sought to withdraw his RLUIPA claim and clarify other claims. In his new claims, he highlighted how the prison, probation, and parole systems fail deaf prisoners by not providing sign language interpretation to explain rules and conditions of their release and then punishing the deaf individuals for violating the rules. He sought to add claims related to his post-incarceration probation or parole. He also asked to add thirteen additional plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of deaf or hard of hearing people currently or formerly incarcerated by GDOC. Finally, the plaintiff sought to eliminate all defendants who did not need to be parties to the case, while adding other defendants, including GDOC, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles (GBOP) and Georgia Department of Community Supervision (GDCS), \n\nOn September 13, 2018, Judge Treadwell issued an order denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint as moot and granted the plaintiff’s motion to file a second amended complaint in part. 2018 WL 4365503. He granted the plaintiff’s motion to clarify his ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act claims, to withdraw his RLUIPA claim, to add one of the thirteen proposed additional plaintiffs, to eliminate unnecessary defendants, and to add GDOC and GBOP as defendants. The plaintiff’s request to add claims relating to his post-incarceration probation or parole was denied because these claims did not arise out of the alleged failure to provide effective communication inside Georgia’s prisons. The court denied the plaintiff’s request to join all but one additional plaintiff because the other proposed plaintiffs remained incarcerated, and thus, had different interests—the incarcerated individuals had an interest in enjoining GDOC’s future behavior whereas the plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief was moot because he had been released.\n\nOn the same day, Judge Treadway also issued a show cause order for why the case should not be consolidated with another, similar case, Woody v. Bryson. Civil Action No. 5:16-CV-467-MTT. \n\nNeither party replied to the order to show cause. The plaintiff moved to voluntarily dismiss his claims, and on September 28, 2018, the court dismissed the case without prejudice.

After being prescribed medication for their Hepatitis C but denied prior authorization for the medication from Missouri’s Medicaid program, two Medicaid recipients initiated this lawsuit on October 18, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The plaintiffs alleged that MO HealthNet’s policies resulted in the denial of medically necessary treatment to Medicaid beneficiaries infected with Hepatitis C, discriminated against similarly situated Medicaid beneficiaries on the basis of their fibrosis score even though Hepatitis C guidelines recommend treatment regardless of their score, and violated the “reasonable promptness” requirement of the Social Security Act by requiring individuals to wait until they had developed more severe liver damage before getting treatment. The plaintiffs brought their claims against the Director of the Missouri Department of Social Services and the Director the of MO HealthNet under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, § 1983, and the Medicaid Act. Represented by legal services, a law school clinic, and the National Health Law Program, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, attorneys’ fees and costs, and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prohibit the defendants from implementing and following their current Hepatitis C treatment policy, as well as enjoin the defendants from refusing to provide Medicaid coverage of medically necessary Hepatitis C drug and require notice to all Medicaid beneficiaries denied coverage under the current policy.\n\nThe case was automatically referred to mediation on October 18, 2016 and assigned to Judge William A. Knox. On January 30, 2017, the case was reassigned to an outside mediator.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Judge Stephen R. Bough granted the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction in part to prohibit the defendants from requiring three months of negative drug and alcohol screens prior to submitting requests for approval of their Hepatitis C medications. The defendants had also agreed that the plaintiffs were entitled to a preliminary injunction to prohibit the drug and alcohol screens. The Court declined to rule on the request to prohibit defendants from applying policies based on fibrosis score until an evidentiary hearing had occurred because at least two factual disputes remained. The Court found that there was enough controversy surrounding the medical necessity of treatment regardless of fibrosis score and conflicting information on whether or not the defendants’ would deny authorization to patients with low fibrosis scores. \n\nOn the same day, Judge Bough also denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Judge Bough rejected the defendants' argument that there was no individualized federal right to reasonable Medicaid standards enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983  because this mischaracterized the plaintiffs’ allegations. The plaintiffs’ alleged that the standards denied medically necessary treatment and Judge Bough noted that this was a valid claim because the Eighth Circuit previously held that the limiting of Medicaid coverage to those recipients meeting certain conditions or criteria violated Medicaid law and 42 U.S.C. §1983.\n\nAfter the evidentiary hearing, Judge Bough denied the plaintiffs’ remaining request for a preliminary injunction on April 24, 2017, which would have prohibited the defendants from applying policies based on fibrosis scores. The plaintiffs did not show they were likely to succeed on the merits to the degree necessary to merit an injunction or any likelihood of immediate irreparable harm.\n\nThe plaintiffs amended the complaint June 6, 2017 to add another Medicaid recipient to the claim who was similarly denied authorization for prescribed Hepatitis C medication. Additionally, plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleged the defendants violated due process for failing to use reasonable, ascertainable, non-arbitrary standards and procedures for determining eligibility for medical assistance, procedural due process for failing to provide notice of the reasons for the denial of coverage, and the American with Disabilities Act for discrimination on the basis of their disability (Hepatitis C).\n\nAfter MO HealthNet modified its preferred drug list and prior authorization criteria for certain medications, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment claiming the case was moot. On November 20, 2017, the plaintiffs’ filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice because the claims were mooted by the new policy that no longer included restrictions based on fibrosis scores or abstinence. All three plaintiffs began to receive treatment for their Hepatitis C. Judge Bough granted the plaintiffs’ motion and denied the motion for summary judgement. The case was dismissed without prejudice with each party to bear its own fees and costs on November 20, 2017.

United States</i></a>, Judge Reed O'Connor of the Northern District of Texas ordered the claims to be severed and removed to a new civil action. Thus, this case was brought on 02/03/2017. The plaintiffs were cisgender women incarcerated in Texas federal prisons. They alleged that their First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments were violated when transgender female prisoners were housed in the same single-sex facilities as the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs also alleged that being housed with transgender prisoners violated their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-4 <i>et seq.</i>). The plaintiffs were represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom. They sought a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. The named defendants were the United States of America, the Attorney General of the United States, the Acting Director of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, and both of the Wardens of the prisons where the plaintiffs were held.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed second and third amended complaints on March 2, 2017 and May 12, 2017, respectively. The third amended complaint included four plaintiffs alleging the same constitutional violations and seeking the same relief. On June 26, 2017, the plaintiffs also filed a motion for preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs asked the Court to enjoin the defendants from housing transgender women in the same facilities as the plaintiffs.\n\nThe parties began to engage in settlement negotiations in September 2017, but failed to reach an agreement. Around the same time, a transgender woman incarcerated at the same facility in question moved to intervene in the action. She alleged that the plaintiffs' complaints were false and driven by anti-transgender biases and prejudices.\n\nOn May 11, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice promulgated revisions to the Transgender Offender Manual for the Bureau of Prisons. In light of the revisions, the plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. The court also ordered the plaintiffs to file a new complaint to specify the claims that would proceed after the revisions.\n\nOn July 11, 2018, three female plaintiffs alleged similar claims as had been alleged in prior complaints; namely, that the housing of transgender female prisoners violated the plaintiffs' right to bodily privacy and endangered their physical and mental health.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims on September 10, 2018. The remaining plaintiff and two intervenors initially opposed the motion and tried to proceed with their claims, filing a motion to certify a proposed class of \"all female inmates who have been housed or otherwise situated with genetically-males inmates identifying as female.\" The plaintiff was eventually released and, as such, did not oppose the motion to dismiss.

In the most recent complaint, the named defendants were the Secretary of Washington Department of Correction, the Chief Medical Officer for DOC, the Chief of Psychiatry for DOC, and the Director of Mental Health for DOC in their official capacities. The case was assigned to Judge Benjamin H. Settle in the District Court for the Western District of Washington. She sued them under 42 U.S.C. 1983.\n\nThe plaintiff alleged that the failure of prison administration to provide her with medically necessary gender affirming treatment amounts to a violation of her rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. She requested injunctive relief requiring the defendants to provide her with adequate transition related care, to give her access to clothing and hygiene products consistent with her gender identity, and to transfer her to a women's facility. \n\nWhile incarcerated, prison staff and administration denied the plaintiff access to transition-related care consistent with the WPATH standards. Due to a blanket DOC policy, the plaintiff had no access to surgical intervention despite medical necessity and her repeated requests. The prison employed a gender dysphoria consultant who supported the blanket ban on gender affirming surgery, however his guidance had been dismissed by courts in several lawsuits for being inconsistent with norms in the field and the WPATH standards. The plaintiff had also faced harassment from staff for her gender presentation, including verbal abuse and extensive time in solitary confinement. \n\nOver the course of discovery, the plaintiff withdrew her request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to make room for a motion on partial summary judgment that she filed on May 18, 2018. The plaintiff also sought sanctions against the defendants for allowing a doctor to ask questions of the plaintiff during a psychological evaluation, but this motion was denied on September 26, 2018. Judge Settle stated that, while the questions were inappropriate, the defendants did not direct the doctor to ask the questions, and there would be no further need for sanctions, since the psychological evaluation is complete.\n\nOn January 4, 2019, Judge Settle issued an opinion denying the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, holding that the DOC policy regarding medical treatment for trans inmates was not unconstitutional on its face. On that date, he referred the matter to Magistrate Judge Richard Creatura. On April 15. 2019, in response, the ACLU amended the complaint.\n\nDuring discovery under the amended complaint, the parties came to an agreement. This settlement agreement would allow the plaintiff to receive gender reassignment surgery if a medical examiner deemed it medically necessary. The plaintiff presented this settlement on March 20, 2020 through a motion to stay proceedings for 180 days in order to allow the settlement agreement to take place.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the ACLU, asked the court to enjoin the cities from violating the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, claiming that the cities failed to provide adequate assistance of counsel. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the cities had failed to impose reasonable caseload limits on public defenders, failed to monitor and oversee the public defense system, failed to provide adequate funds for public defense, and failed to provide representation at all critical stages of prosecution.  \n\nThe Cities had jointly contracted with two attorneys to handle all public defense assistance cases, and each attorney handled over 1,000 cases per year even though such a caseload was three times the maximum allowable amount for a full-time public defender pursuant to standards established by the Washington State Bar Association. The cities had not established any system for ensuring that the attorneys investigate cases, prepare for trial, or communicate timely and adequately with clients. \n\nOn July 5, 2011, the defendant municipalities removed the case to federal court, where it was assigned to Judge Robert S. Lasnik of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. In response to motions from both the plaintiff and the defendants, on February 23, 2012, Judge Lasnik denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction because the balance of hardships did not tip in their favor, and the defendant's motion for summary judgment because the plaintiffs provided evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendants knew indigent criminal defendants were not receiving adequate representation and were indifferent to this inadequacy. \n\nThe same day, Judge Lasnik granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification. The class certified was \"all indigent persons who have been or will be charged with one or more crimes in the municipal courts of either Mount Vernon or Burlington, who have been or will be appointed a public defender, and who continue to have or will have a public defender appearing in their cases.\"\n\nBetween June 3 and June 18, 2012, the parties went to a bench trial. However, on June 28 the judge issued an order for further briefing. Specifically, Judge Lasnik sought information on the following questions <ol> <li>Have any federal courts taken over supervision of a public defense agency, either directly or through appointment of a supervisor/monitor, anywhere in the United States?</li> <li>Have any state or federal courts held a municipality liable under Monell for constitutional defects in its public defense system?</li> <li>Has any state or municipality adopted “hard” caseload standards like those that Washington is contemplating?</li> <li>Is the issue of the constitutionality of the representation afforded by Messrs. Sybrandy and Witt moot? If so, what impact does that have on the available remedy, including an award of attorney fees? The responses were due for August 14th and submitted that day.</li></ol>\nOn December 4, 2013, Judge Lasnik found that the plaintiffs established a systematic deprivation of their right to counsel and the Cities' responsibility for the deprivation. The Court granted injunctive relief (1) requiring that the cities re-evaluate their contract for the provision of public defense services to insure that indigent criminal defendants were provided the actual assistance of counsel; and (2) requiring the cities to hire one part-time public defense supervisor to supervise and evaluate the provision of legal services. The Court also granted attorney's fees. 989 F.Supp.2d 1122 (2013).\n\nOn April 15, 2014, the Court issued an order awarding attorneys' fees and costs. 2014 WL 11961980.

During that time she sent several reports detailing the improvements the defendants had made to their public defense system. \n\nIn March 2017, the public defense supervisor proposed that the court extend her term and transition to a public defense auditor during the year. The Cities of Mount Vernon and Burlington responded in agreement, stating they had made the public defense supervisor's suggestions permanent and no longer needed to be supervised.

The court denied the TRO on June 11 but granted the preliminary injunction on June 26. <hr>\n\nAs part of New York’s ban on gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance at houses of worship and outdoor religious gatherings was strictly limited.  In June, state and city officials allowed mass gatherings protesting the death of George Floyd, but continued to actively enforce prohibitions against congregational worship.  Two Catholic priests and three Orthodox Jews filed this lawsuit on June 10, 2020, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, alleging that Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio, by allowing protests while prohibiting worship, were discriminating against people of faith and violating their constitutional rights.  Represented by the Thomas More Society, they alleged violations of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments (under 42 U.S.C. §1983), the New York Constitution, and the New York Executive Law.  They sought a declaration that the restrictions on indoor and outdoor worship were unconstitutional and were illegal under New York law; a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a final injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing limitations on worship services; and attorneys’ fees and costs.  The case was assigned to Senior Judge Gary L.

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, was a former AT&T employee and asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, alleging that AT&T's health insurance policy discriminated against women.  Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendant's health insurance plan, which did not provide prescription contraceptives (birth control) before 2002 and only through the mail after 2002, violated female employees' civil rights.\n\nThe action originally started in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, but was transferred to Missouri on May 12, 2003.  This is the date on which the docket begins.  Originally, there were two plaintiffs on the case, but one dropped out of the litigation.  Thus, a single plaintiff carried forth the case.\n\nOn September 3, 2004, the Court (Judge Sachs) denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification.  In the opinion, the Court barely discussed the requirements for a class-action lawsuit, except to point out typicality.  The plaintiff, since the suit began, had stopped taking birth control and was seeking to get pregnant.  Therefore, the Court declared that a class could not be certified without a class representative who would have an ongoing interest in the prayed-for relief.  The plaintiff wanted to recover her past expenditures on the prescribed contraceptives.  The Women's Law project came onto the case as an amicus.  After a lengthy discovery period, the Court made another ruling.\n\nOn June 7, 2006, the Court (Judge Sachs) granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification as to the damages in the complaint.  The class was comprised of female employees of AT&T, who paid for their own prescription contraception from the dates of October 31, 2001 to July 2, 2002.  The Court did not certify the claims for injunctive or declaratory relief because as of 2002, the health insurance provider covered birth control through mail order. While the cost of the plaintiff's potential recovery was relatively small, $68.07, the class action potential in the litigation, given AT&T's size made both parties fight vigorously.  According to the docket, neither side was content with this decision.  The plaintiff wanted the period of time for damages claims to be extended, and the defendant did not approve of the decision at all.  Ultimately, the plaintiffs filed an appeal.  \n\nOn June 1, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a preliminary judgment to the District Court (Judge Sachs).  The Circuit Court advised the District Court to review the findings of another recent case, In Re Union Pacific Railroad Employment Practices Litigation, 479 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2007).  This case featured a ruling that was fundamentally at odds with the decision of the District Court on June 7, 2006.\n\nOn October 22, 2007, the District Court (Judge Sachs) vacated its previous decision, and ordered a decision in favor of the defendant.

The plaintiffs, represented by the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union and by East River Legal Services, asked the court for class certification and declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated by the conditions of their confinement. Specifically, they complained of fire hazards, unsanitary food, work safety hazards, poor ventilation, inadequate plumbing, inadequate medical care, inadequate dental care, inadequate psychological care, overcrowding, lack of hot water, lack of heat in winter, inadequate law library, lack of recreation and exercise, and inadequate grievance procedures.\n\nOn May 31, 1984, the district court (Judge Donald J.

Protections used would involve less restrictive security measures. Disciplinary detention could no longer exceed 15 days for a single disciplinary charge and 30 days for multiple disciplinary charges. The county also implemented a mental health screening policy that allowed the director of mental health to stop inappropriate placements in solitary confinement. The settlement agreement permitted the plaintiffs’ counsel access to people detained in the jail, jail records, and the facility itself to ensure full compliance with the settlement. The defendants agreed to pay $11,123 in attorneys’ fees and cost. Under the agreement, any alleged non-compliance would first be brought to the defendant’s counsel, with the opportunity for mediation. The settlement agreement was enforceable for two years. If the mediation failed to resolve the issue, plaintiffs were permitted to move the Court for reinstatement or ask for a one-time one-year extension of the agreement.

{"document": "On April 14, 1999, a consent decree was approved in <i>Pigford v. Glickman</i> (FH-DC-0006 in this Clearinghouse; see \"related cases\", below), involving a class of thousands of African American farmers who had sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture over racially discriminatory farm loan denials. 185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C. 1999). In the settlement, two \"claim tracks\" were created: Track A, which had a lower standard of proof of discrimination (paying up to $50,000 for credit claims and $3,000 for non-credit claims), and Track B, which required a preponderance of the evidence (paying up to $250,000).  The deadline for claims under this settlement was October 12, 1999.  The Consent Decree allowed claimants who could show \"extraordinary circumstances\" for missing the October 12 deadline to file at a later date, until the final deadline of September 15, 2000.  In total 61,000 claims were brought late, but fewer than 3,000 were adjudicated based on the merits.\n\nOn May 22, 2008, the Food, Conservation and Energy Act (a/k/a \"2008 Farm Bill\") was enacted, providing claimants a right to pursue discrimination claims if they had petitioned to participate but did not get their petitions considered on the merits because they were filed late. Pub. L. 110-234, 122 Stat. 923. Section 14012 of the bill created a completely new cause of action for these \"late-filers,\" which could be brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Subsequently, a large number of suits were filed under this new cause of action.\n\nOn August 8, 2008, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia consolidated 17 cases resulting from Section 14012 that were currently pending in the district court: Agee v. Schafer (C.A.. No. 08-0882); Kimbrough v. Schafer (08-0901); Adams v. Schafer (08-0919); National Black Farmers Association v. Schafer (08-0940); Bennet v. Schafer (08-0962); McKinney v.

All together, these matters were captioned In re Black Farmers' Litigation, and given the docket number 08-mc-0511.\n\nOn November 14, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, including a request to certify a putative class of \"All individuals: (1) who submitted late-filing requests under section 5(g) of the <i>Pigford v.

The settlement agreement created a class with the description language from the amended complaint (see above). This settlement maintained the two tracks of claims, established \"neutrals\" who were assigned to adjudicate the settlement claims, and created an ombudsman position, which was to act as the liaison between the claimants and the court. In return for the re-evaluation of late-filing claims, the plaintiffs agreed to move for dismissal of all pending consolidated cases with prejudice, to be effective upon the court's final approval. After the execution of the initial form of the settlement agreement, six additional complaints were filed and consolidated with this case: Edwards v. Vilsack (10-0456); Latham v. Vilsack (10-0737); Andrews v. Vilsack (10-0801); Sanders v. Vilsack (10-1053); Johnson v. Vilsack (10-0839); and Abney v.

Supp. 2d 78 (D.D.C. 2011).\n\nOn November 15, 2011, one of the plaintiffs in the consolidated case, the Black Farmers and Agriculturalist Association (BFAA), moved for reconsideration of the settlement approval.  The BFAA argued that the settlement should not have been approved because it unfairly prevented plaintiffs from pursuing substantive relief under the Section 741 of the 1999 Farm Bill.  This motion was denied on January 13, 2012, by Judge Friedman.  2012 WL 8007271 (D.D.C. 2012).  The BFAA and another class member, Charlie Latham, appealed this denial to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  On July 25, 2012, the Court of Appeals, in a per curiam order, denied the reconsideration appeal for the BFAA because the BFAA is not an \"individual\" under the class settlement, thereby not a part of the settlement.  In the same order, the Court of Appeals also denied Latham's appeal because he had already received a determination on his <i>Pigford</i> claim.  On February 26, 2013, the Supreme Court of the United States denied BFAA and Latham's petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\nOn February 6, 2012, Stephen Carpenter was appointed the independent ombudsman per the settlement agreement.  842 F. Supp. 2d 190 (D.D.C. 2012).\n\nOn May 11, 2012, the claim process ended.  The parties in this case moved on August 17, 2012 to alter the settlement to provide relief for claimants who missed the deadline for certain circumstances.  On September 14, 2012, Judge Friedman approved this alteration of the settlement, which allowed claimants who made a claim before the May 11 deadline and made a prima facie showing of class membership but was not sent a claim form before May 1, 2012 to have their claim considered \"timely\" if resubmitted within 30 days of the approved alteration.\n\nOn May 24, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion to further modify the settlement agreement to allow certain claims previously denied as “incomplete” to be considered for adjudication on the merits. There are potentially 384 claims under the subject of this motion. On June 21, 2013, Judge Friedman denied this motion. \n\nJudge Friedman granted many more motions to amend the settlement agreement on the following dates: August 27, 2013, April 7, 2014, September 17, 2014, August 31, 2016, March 28, 2017. \n\nAs of August 2020, the court is still reviewing invoices submitted by the Ombudsman’s office; the case is ongoing.", "summary": "Plaintiffs in this case are claimants under the <i>Pigford v.

{"document": "On September 9, 2014, the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), along with several of its members who had been discriminated against by Uber drivers because of their service animals, filed this lawsuit in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California. They sued Uber under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 12811 et seq.), the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code §§ 51 & 52), and the California Disabled Persons Act (California Civil Code §§ 54-54.3). Represented by Disability Rights Advocates and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages for the named plaintiffs.\n\nThe plaintiffs accused Uber drivers of, among other things, refusing to provide service to people with service dogs, mistreating the dogs and their owners, unfairly giving them negative feedback scores, and charging inappropriate cancellation fees. They alleged that Uber’s response to complaints about driver behavior was opaque and insufficient: Uber generally failed to notify service dog owners of whether the company had investigated complaints, and denied responsibility for drivers’ behavior.\n\nOn October 22, 2014, Uber filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the NFB and the named plaintiffs all lacked standing to sue under both state and federal law. Uber also argued that even if the plaintiffs had standing, Uber wasn’t a public accommodation and thus wasn’t covered by Title III of the ADA. \n\nThe United States Department of Justice issued a statement of interest on December 23, 2014. It asked the court to consider the Department of Transportation’s Title III regulations, which are granted considerable weight since the DOT is responsible for implementing the ADA. DOT regulations state that Title III applies to any “demand-responsive” service that doesn’t operate on a fixed route, and that private entities cannot “contract away” any responsibilities under the ADA. 49 C.F.R. § 37.3; 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. D § 37.23.

{"document": "On March 30, 2006, the Phoenix District Office of the EEOC filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiff sued the automobile repairer AutoZone, Inc. under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiff, representing a female employee of AutoZone Inc., asked the court for monetary relief for the complainant and injunctive relief enjoining the defendant from future discrimination on the basis of sex. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that her manager at AutoZone Inc. had sexually harassed her, and that her employer had retaliated against her when she complained of the sexual harassment. \n\nOn June 5, 2008 Judge Stephen M McNamee granted the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment with regard to the defendant's affirmative defense. AutoZone Inc. had argued as an affirmative defense that the complainant's previous conviction of disorderly conduct would have constituted termination regardless of her sexual harassment complaints. The Court found this defense lacked sufficient evidence and was merely speculation. AutoZone Inc. further argued an affirmative defense that punitive damages in this case were a violation of the state and federal constitution. Judge McNamee found this affirmative defense erroneous. \n\nOn September 11, 2008 Judge Stephen M McNamee denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. Judge McNamee ruled that material questions remained with regard to the sexual harassment, the plaintiff's actions following the sexual harassment, and whether the complainant was retaliated against after she filed complaints of sexual harassment. Given these remaining questions, summary judgement was inappropriate. \n\nThe parties then disputed jury instruction. On December 11, 2008, the EEOC provided proposed jury instructions. The defendant claimed that the instructions were incorrect because the plaintiff had not pled that tangible employment action occurred in retaliation to her complaint. On June 1, 2009, Judge McNamee found the instructions proper. The model instructions direct the jury to find whether or not the complainant proved she had suffered a tangible employment action. If found, the defendant was vicariously liable for the manager's conduct, and the defendant's affirmative defense would not be considered. \n\nOn June 10, 2009, a jury found for the plaintiff. The jury found that the plaintiff did experience a hostile work environment, but also found that AutoZone Inc. did not retaliate against the complainant. The jury found AutoZone Inc. liable to the complainant for $15,000 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in punitive damages. \n\nOn June 22, 2009 the defendant moved for a judgment as a matter of law, or alliteratively, a new trial.  On July 24, 2009 Judge McNamee found that there was legally sufficient evidence for the jury finding, and there was not mistake in the case. He denied both motions. \n\nOn June 25, 2009, the EEOC moved to amend the judgment to include equitable relief. On November 9, 2009, Judge McNamee partially granted the EEOC's motion. He granted requests to require training programs, and he granted the request to require updated posters with specific information about Title VII and a complaint process. He denied the motion for a permanent injunction enjoining the defendant from discriminating against employees based on sex because the complainant in this case was the only to come forward with a complaint, and because AutoZone had sufficiently shown that sexual harassment was unlikely to reoccur. He also denied relief requiring the defendant to investigate all employee complaints of sexual harassment from the last three years, relief requiring the defendant to change its complaint process, and relief requiring monitoring and reporting. \n\nThe Defendant then moved for partial reconsideration with regard to new postings on Title VII. One January 6, 2010, Judge McNamee ordered that the original posters may be used as a foundation, but he found three problems that must be corrected. The posters must be updated, they must include EEOC contact information for the Phoenix Field Office, and they must be moved further from the manager's offices. \n\nOn July 23, 2012, Judge McNamee found that the defendant had paid the ordered monetary damages, so he ordered that the bond securing judgment could be released. \n", "summary": "On March 30, 2016, the Phoenix District Office of the EEOC filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.

Specifically, the complaint alleged that Denny's implemented terms and conditions for service of black customers, such as the requirement of prepayment and cover charges, that were not required of white patrons, that African Americans received poorer service, and that they were discouraged from patronizing the restaurant. \n\nThe complaint was filed contemporaneously with a consent decree, which was approved by the Court on April 1, 1993. On July 2, 1993, the Court, on its own motion, consolidated the case with Ridgeway v. Denny's Corporation, a class action filed on March 24, 1993, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Both actions alleged violations of the Public Accommodations Act in relation to Denny's treatment of African American customers. The class action also alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), California Business and Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq., California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq. and California Civil Code §§ 1750 et seq.\n\nFollowing execution of the original decree, numerous complaints of racial discrimination were submitted to the Plaintiff Class and the United States. The United States investigated the complaints and, on May 24, 1994, submitted an amended consent decree to expand the protections to customers and prevent future discrimination. The amended consent decree prohibited Denny's from engaging in discriminatory treatment of African Americans and established procedures for compliance, including a comprehensive non-discrimination training program, as well as provisions for notice, advertising, testing, monitoring and record keeping. It also required the defendants to establish a $28 million settlement fund for the plaintiff class, and appointment of a Special Master. The Amended Consent Decree was given final approval by the Court (Judge James Ware) on July 29, 1994. \n\nAfter preliminary approval of the Amended Consent Decree, the parties received reports that a number of individuals and organizations in California were charging fees for services related to the preparation and/or filing of claims in the case.

{"document": "On May 4, 1990, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division announced, in a letter to the Governor of Virginia, its intent to launch an investigation, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq., into conditions at the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC), an institution for individuals with developmental disabilities in Fairfax, Virginia.  Five experts from the Department of Justice toured the facility, reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed NVTC staff, and audited reporting and investigation practices.  \n\nOn April 9, 1991, the Department of Justice announced its findings.  The Department of Justice reported that the health and safety of people living at NVTC was at risk for a number of reasons.  NVTC employed too few people and inadequately trained those it did employ, which placed residents in danger of unnecessary chemical and physical restraint.  Often mechanical restraints were accompanied by seclusion, which was a fire hazard.  Individualized programming for residents was inadequate and recordkeeping deficiencies made it impossible to monitor an individual's progress.  In addition, NVTC's medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medication and side effect monitoring we all inadequate.  In addition, NVTC provided insufficient medical care, including medication monitoring and occupational therapy.  Recordkeeping made it difficult to track the efficacy of individualized programming and medical care.  In closing, the Department of Justice expressed the desire to negotiate a resolution.\n\nNegotiations did not make enough progress and, on May 31, 1994, the Department of Justice threatened to file a CRIPA lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of conditions at NVTC.  In addition to its earlier concerns, the Department of Justice chronicled systematic abuse and neglect at NVTC.  For instance, individualized training programs were so inadequate that individuals became seriously sick or died as the result of aggressive, pica, and other self-injurious behaviors.  One resident asphyxiated on a rubber glove, while another ate a reported seven cigarettes and one feminine hygiene pad in the span of two days.  Similarly, inappropriate feeding techniques and poor nutrition endangered residents' health. \n\nVirginia may have made an effort engage in productive negotiations, but the Department of Justice was not satisfied.  On February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice notified the Governor of Virginia that, in addition to being unconstitutional, the conditions at NVTC violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794, the Social Security Act (\"Medicaid\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq., and Virginia law.\n\nOn March 4, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a CRIPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, challenging conditions at NVTC.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to address (1) individualized programming, (2) undue physical restraint and isolation, (3) facility safety, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) medication monitoring, especially for tardive dyskenesia, and (7) staff numbers and training.  \n\nOn May 21, 1996, the court (Judge Leonie M. Brinkema) refused to consolidate this lawsuit with United States v. Virginia, No. 96-284, MH-VA-0002, an action challenging the constitutionality of conditions at a Virginia psychiatric hospital.  On May 21, 1996, the court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed its ruling to allow for settlement.  On July 18, 1996, the court approved a settlement agreement.\n\nThe settlement agreement itself was mostly concerned with procedural elements, such as development of a plan for improvement, compliance deadlines, evaluation, and dismissal.  The NVTC plan describes the required compliance.  The plan emphasizes the importance of trained staff in the provision of developmental disability services.  The plan stated detailed training requirements for direct care staff and incorporated training into almost every solution.  For instance, the plan mandated the dismissal of employees who neglected or abused residents.  Similarly, the plan sought to reduce the need for restraints by both improving staff development and requiring the interdisciplinary treatment teams' advance approval for the type of restraints to be used for each individual.  Thus, both chemical restraints and draconian physical restraint techniques, such as papoose boards, were eliminated.  Similar clauses addressed medical care, medication administration and tracking, physical and occupational therapy, abuse and injury reporting and investigations, recordkeeping, functional planning, community placement, and quality assurance.  \n\nThe parties modified the settlement on May 30, 1997.  On August 29, 1997, the Department of Justice inspected NVTC and found it was in compliance with the plan.  On June 3, 1998, the court dismissed the lawsuit.\n\n", "summary": "On May 4, 1990, the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. §1997 et seq., into conditions at the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC).

The plaintiffs alleged that Idaho’s Sexual Offender Registration Notification and Community Right-to-Know Act was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process and the Ex Post Facto clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs also alleged that the Sex Offender Registry and accompanying statutes further violated the Substantive Due Process, Equal Protection, Double Jeopardy, Contracts, and Takings clauses of the U.S. and Idaho Constitutions. \n\nThe plaintiffs were from across the country. Most were convicted of sexual offenses in 1980s and 1990s. One of their major complaints was that subsequent amendments to Idaho’s sex-offender registry laws amounted to unconstitutional retroactive punishment. For example, John Doe 100, of Bannock County, was convicted of a misdemeanor sexual offense in Montana in 1996. His offense did not require registration in Montana. He moved to Idaho in 2005 and was not required to register until 2007, 11 years after his conviction, when Idaho authorities reclassified his offense as a felony rather than the original misdemeanor. \n\nThe plaintiffs sought a permanent order to stop the state and its counties from enforcing specific provisions of the Sex Offender Registry and accompanying statutes and laws. An amended complaint was filed on Apr. 26, 2017, which argued that the defendants further violated the plaintiffs' rights to: acquire, possess and protect property; seek and obtain safety and happiness; travel, life and liberty; and freedom of association and religion protected by the U.S. and Idaho Constitutions.

{"document": "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information.

The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing DHCS from reducing at-home medical care and support for the plaintiffs, and a permanent injunction preventing unnecessary institutionalization in the future. They also sought attorney’s fees. The plaintiffs were represented by Disability Rights California.\n\nAt the time, the plaintiffs, who were once institutionalized because of their disabilities, were living in their own homes where they received Medicaid-funded nursing and attendant care through the California Medi-Cal Home and Community Based Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver Program (“Waiver Program”). They alleged that they were at risk of institutionalization because DHCS maintained unnecessarily low cost limits for these services.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. The amended complaint added an organizational plaintiff, In Spirit, a non-profit organization that provided financial assistance to persons with disabilities to receive medical care in their home. \n \nOn July 7, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. This complaint added a new named plaintiff, dismissed one of the existing named plaintiffs, elaborated on the factual allegations, and added a third claim for violations of California state law. On September 23, 2015, In Spirit was voluntarily dismissed as a party in the lawsuit. \n\nOn January 26, 2016, the parties held a mediation session but were unable to reach an agreement. Throughout the mediation, the parties continued to engage in discovery. On March 8, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. On March 10, 2016, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgement. District Judge Fernando Olguin denied both motions on April 27, 2016. He further set out deadlines for continued discovery.\n \nOn March 29, 2016, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division (\"DOJ\") filed a statement of interest to clarify the defendant’s obligations under the ADA. The DOJ explained that the ADA prohibits unjustified institutionalization and requires individuals with disabilities receive support and services in the most integrated setting as mandated in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). The DOJ also clarified that the defendants could not administer the Medicaid waiver without accounting for individual needs and that the integration mandate protects individuals at serious risk of institutionalization. The DOJ filed subsequent statements of interest on August 4, 2016 and September 16, 2016, which further clarified the states’ ADA obligations in light of DHCS’s arguments against the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgement.\n\nOn July 18, 2016, the plaintiffs again moved for summary judgement, which Judge Olguin denied on August 4, 2016 due to continued factual disputes. Judge Olguin also noted being “deeply troubled” by the defendants’ repeated failure to comply in good faith with discovery requests and threatened to impose sanctions.\n\nOn September 7, 2016, the plaintiffs again filed a motion for summary judgement. On June 5, 2017, the Court denied that motion, finding that genuine issues of material fact remained regarding whether or not the California waiver program’s cost limits created a serious risk of institutionalization and whether California had an existing deinstitutionalization scheme in place that was effective. 385 F. Supp. 3d 1048. \n\nThe parties continued with discovery, and it appears they continued engaging in settlement talks as well. On March 14, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss their case without prejudice, and on March 19, 2018, the court granted this motion for voluntary dismissal of most of the case. There was some continued litigation over whether the plaintiffs were entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. \n\nThe dismissal seems to come from the fact that DHCS eventually changed the waiver application process so that decisions would be based on medical necessity without any mention of cost limits. In their motion opposing attorneys’ fees, the defendants asserted that this made the plaintiffs' claims moot, and that there was no basis for awarding attorneys’ fees or costs. The plaintiffs argued that the overall course of events demonstrated that this litigation was a significant factor prompting defendants to eliminate waiver cost limits, which created a presumption that plaintiffs were a catalyst and, because defendants could not rebut that presumption, plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys fees’ and costs under a state statute. \n\nOn May 30, 2019, Judge Olguin granted the plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys fees. The court found that the litigation led to the elimination of DHCS’s cost limits, conferring a significant benefit for potentially thousands of people. The elimination of cost limits would ensure that participants would not have to resort to litigation to secure needed services and that they would be able to remain in their homes and avoid segregation and isolation. The court ordered the plaintiffs to file their motion for attorneys’ fees and costs no later than July 31, 2019. 2019 WL 2590170. \n\nAfter a brief delay, the parties agreed on how much the defendants should pay in attorneys’ fees. They notified the court that they had resolved all outstanding issues in this case on November 22, 2019. The notification did not state the size of the award, so the Clearinghouse is unaware of the amount. The case is now closed.

The plaintiffs alleged that the President’s September 26, 2019, Executive Order violated the Refugee Act of 1980, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.), and principles of federalism. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction to enjoin enforcement of the Order. The case was assigned to Judge Peter J. Messitte.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that Executive Order 13888 made an unprecedented change to the refugee resettlement process by mandating that refugees not be resettled in the United States unless the state and locality where they are to be resettled take the affirmative step of providing written consent. As national refugee resettlement agencies, the plaintiffs were then charged by the federal government with the responsibility of soliciting and obtaining written consent from all states and localities where refugees they assist could be resettled. The plaintiffs claimed that such a change would provide individual states and local governments with effective veto power over refugee resettlement. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction on November 22, 2019.

{"document": "On October 5, 2012, the Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta, the Catholic Diocese of Savannah, and affiliated Catholic organizations filed this U.S. District Court lawsuit in the Northern District of Georgia against the Federal Government under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the First and Fifth Amendments, and as a violation of the Constitution's Separation of Powers provisions.  Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, seek to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage.  Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\nPlaintiffs amended their complaint a first time on December 31, 2012, and a second time on August 19, 2013 to challenge the ACA as amended by the 2013 Final Rules. They argued that while the Diocese itself likely fell within the \"religious employer\" exception, the affiliated Catholic entities did not and, instead, were considered \"eligible organizations\" qualifying for an accommodation. The accommodation would require plaintiffs to provide self-certification to their insurance provider setting forth their religious objections to the ACA, in turn trigging an obligation on the part of the insurance provider to procure the services plaintiffs find objectionable. According to the plaintiffs, this series of events makes them the but-for cause of providing contraception coverage in violation of their sincerely held beliefs. Plaintiffs continued to ask the court to grant a permanent injunction against enforcement of the relevant provisions of the ACA.\n\nOn March 26, 2014, the District Court (Judge William S. Duffey, Jr.) permanently enjoined the government from enforcing the contraceptive mandate against plaintiffs. 2014 WL 1256373. The court noted that the contraception mandate, including the self-certification form, placed a substantial burden on plaintiffs by compelling them to affirmatively modify their behavior and violate their religious beliefs. The court also held that the general applicability of the law was not a compelling state interest nor was the conception mandate the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. On May 23, 2014, the government appealed this case to the Eleventh Circuit. \n\nOn May 30, 2014, Judge Duffey issued an opinion and order in response to the government's motion for Reconsideration on the Dioceses' RFRA and free exercise claims. 2014 WL 2441742. The government had also asked the court to reconsider whether or not the affiliated entities maintained a \"church plan\" under ERISA. If they did, they would be exempt from the self-certification requirement, and not have standing to challenge the mandate. Judge Duffey held that the Dioceses' RFRA and free exercise claims should be dismissed, and clarified that the affiliated organizations did not need to establish that they were church plans, because the self-certification requirement was a substantial burden on their religious exercise. \n\nThis case was consolidated on appeal with <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13619\">Eternal Word Television Network v. Sebelius</a>. On February 18, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit (Judge Jill Pryor) held that the contraception mandate does not violate the RFRA because it is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest, but enjoined enforcement of the mandate against the plaintiffs because the issue of whether the accommodation violates the RFRA was currently before the Supreme Court. 818 F.3d 1122. \n\nOn May 31, 2016, following the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13465\">Zubik v.

The parties were ordered to file status reports sixty days after the given order. \n\nAlso on August 10, 2016, the defendants moved for an order materially identical to the remand orders the Supreme Court issued in <i> Zubik </i>. The defendants moved for this motion because they wanted to modify the existing injunction against them and have the ability to tell insurance issuers and third party administrators of their requirement to make separate payments for contraceptives given the plaintiffs met the requirements under the accommodation. This would ensure the affected women that would be under the plaintiffs insurance receive coverage while the litigation continued. The plaintiffs opposed the motion. \n\nOn October 3, 2016, the court granted the defendant's motion for materially identical orders. The new injunction stated: \n\n“As such, we modify the injunction entered on May 31, 2016 to add that: Nothing in this opinion, [in this Court's prior opinion or orders], or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that women covered by the [plaintiffs'] health plans \"obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives.\" Through this litigation, [plaintiffs] have made the Government aware of their view that they meet \"the requirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds. Nothing in this opinion, [in this Court's prior opinions or orders], or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, \"precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of frill contraceptive coverage\" going forward. Because the Government may rely on this notice, the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on [plaintiffs] for failure to provide the relevant notice.”\n\nBoth parties filed status reports on October 11, 2016, stating the defendants were sorting through the 52,000 comments received during the governments’ Request for Information (RFI) and required additional time to determine if modifications were necessary to accommodate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act claim still pending. \n\nThe parties then continued to file monthly status reports with no changes to the case until October 16, 2017. However, during this time President Trump issued an executive order in May of 2017, called the \"Executive Order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty\". As a result, on October 6, 2017, the US Department of Health and Human Services released a statement explaining the changes in policy related to President Trump's executive order requiring HHS to consider amending the accommodation requirements under the ACA for the contraception mandate.

The plaintiffs alleged that at least a quarter of the more than 8,000 individuals with traumatic brain injuries living in nursing homes or rehabilitation facilities in Massachusetts would be able to and would prefer to reside in an integrated community setting, provided they received appropriate aids and support.

Initially this program would offer 300 such waivers.  Individuals receiving the waivers would participate in developing their own Individualized Service Plan with an interdisciplinary team and would receive services appropriate to their level of need. Waiver recipients would have the option of living with family, where applicable, or of living in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, e.g., their own apartment or home, or in a group home.\n\nMassachusetts reserved the right to deny waivers to any person whose annual costs of care to Medicaid from residential habilitation and other waiver services, plus Title XIX state plan services, would exceed $164,131, and also to deny waivers to any person whose annual Medicaid waiver costs, exclusive of Title XIX and residential costs, would likely exceed $87,919.  The settlement limited the total cost of the waiver program, inclusive of all Medicaid and state-funded expenditures for the participants, to $15,000,000. In order to stay within this cap, the state reserved the right to take corrective actions, such as reducing the number of waivers available.

The plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing the government from acting to “deny or refuse consideration” of their visa petitions, a declaration that the Proclamations were unlawful, and attorney’s fees. They sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. § 706) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. §§ 1182, 1185) and alleged that the defendants’ conduct exceeded their authority and violated the plaintiffs’ rights under the Due Process Clause. \n\nThe plaintiffs moved to certify a class of visa sponsors whose beneficiaries or derivative beneficiaries were subject to the Proclamations and at risk of aging out on June 2. \n\nOn June 23, Judge Mehta denied the plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction and class certification because they failed to show that a justiciable case or controversy existed. Specifically, Judge Mehta found that the plaintiffs had not shown that they faced imminent injury because some of the plaintiffs’ minor beneficiaries had successfully applied for visas under the “national interest exception” (a separate administrative procedure), and others had been unable to apply for visas for reasons unrelated to the Proclamations. 2020 WL 3429786. \n\nThe plaintiffs then amended their complaint on July 17, 2020, adding as plaintiffs corporations that were unable to hire necessary workers because workers’ visas had not been issued along with diversity visa selectees whose visas had to issue by September 30 to remain eligible for entry. They also proposed the following four subclasses: \n\n1.\tThose who will be unable to receive their diversity visas before Sept. 30 deadline, and will thus be unable to immigrate. \n\n2.\tCitizens who have sponsored an immediate relative who now cannot immigrate. \n\n3.\tLawful permanent residents who have an “approved immigrant visa petition for a preference relative” who, because of the Proclamations, will be unable to immigrate.\n\n4.\t U.S. employers whose employees or potential employees cannot now immigrate.\n\nSeveral states and the District of Columbia also filed an amicus brief arguing that immigrants were good for their economies and that the presidential action would hurt their recovery.\n\nThree other suits filed between July 10, 2020 and August 5, 2020 were fully consolidated with this case on August 13: <i>Aker v. Trump</i>, No. 20-cv-1926; <i>Mohammed v. Pompeo</i>, No. 20-cv-1856; and <i>Fonjong v. Trump</i>, No. 20-cv-2128. In all of these cases, the plaintiffs were diversity visa selectees and derivative beneficiaries challenging Presidential Proclamations 10014 and 10052 under the APA; two (<i>Mohammed</i> and <i>Fonjong</i>) were filed by the same law firm. \n\nJudge Mehta also partially consolidated <i>Panda v. Wolf</i>, No. 20-cv-1907, with this case to the extent that <i>Panda</i> raised similar issues. <i>Panda</i> involved an APA challenge to Proclamation 10052 but also included an equal protection argument that the government's conduct disparately impacted Indian nationals. On September 16, Judge Mehta denied the <i>Panda</i> plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction in the part of that case continuing separately. 2020 WL 5545554. The <i>Panda</i> plaintiffs appealed, and on September 29, <i>Panda</i> was stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.\n\nFollowing the consolidation, many influential companies filed an amicus brief as well, arguing that they would suffer serious economic harm from the proclamations. The companies included Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Paypal, Reddit, Twitter, Uber Technologies, and Zillow. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 23, 2020, adding a claim under the Mandamus Act (28 U.S.C. § 1361) and requesting that the court issue an order of mandamus requiring defendants to adjudicate visa petitions. \n\nOn September 4, 2020, Judge Mehta granted the DV-2020 plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. The defendants were ordered to “undertake good-faith efforts . . . to expeditiously process and adjudicate DV-2020 diversity visas.” Defendants were preliminarily enjoined “from interpreting and applying the COVID Guidance to DV-2020 selectees” in such a way as not to process their visas because they were not “mission critical.” The remaining motions and requests were not granted. The court also delayed certifying a class, and the non DV-2020 plaintiffs did not obtain injunctive relief because vacatur of the policy would not eliminate their family separation problem. 2020 WL 5367010.\n\nOn September 14, 2020, the court amended the preliminary injunction to prevent the State Department from waiting 14 days to issue visas to DV-2020 applicants who were inside certain COVID-affected regions because the delay served no rational purpose. 2020 WL 5886855. On September 24, 2020, non DV-2020 plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit over the ruling against their motion for a preliminary injunction. \n\nOn September 30, 2020, the court certified a class in <i>Gomez</i> consisting of all “Individuals who have been selected to receive an immigrant visa through the U.S. Department of State’s FY2020 Diversity Visa Lottery and who had not received their immigrant visa on or before April 23, 2020, when the Presidential Proclamation 10014, later extended by Presidential Proclamation 10052, took effect.” But the court declined to certify a class in <i>Aker</i> because it was unclear how many applicants who were issued visas before the Proclamation had not been able to have them renewed, and because there was no legal impediment to renewing a visa. It also ordered the State Department to reserve 9,095 visas (calculated based on the expected reduction due to COVID-19) to correct for the loss of visas due to the illegal processing delays. 2020 WL 5861101. \n\nThis case is ongoing.\n", "summary": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the State Department ceased processing most visas on March 20, 2020. Over the next few months, President Trump issued two Proclamations which effectively suspended the entry of all immigrants to the US for two months, unless they qualified for an exception. The State Department also suspended review and adjudication of visas. Relatives of minors who would age out of preferential treatment filed suit, seeking injunctive relief. On July 17, plaintiffs amended their complaint and expanded the putative class to include companies that were unable to bring in necessary workers and Diversity Visa Selectees who must have visas issued before Sept. 30 to be eligible for entry. \r\n\r\nOn September 4, Judge Mehta granted preliminary injunctive relief to the DV-2020 plaintiffs, but not the others. This was followed by further orders for the State Department to process the visas and to hold a number of DV-2020 visas for the plaintiffs past the September 30 deadline. The case in ongoing. "}

The plaintiff, represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief claiming that a mass surveillance program conducted by the DEA violated the HRW and its staff's First Amendment free speech and free association rights as well as their Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nSpecifically, HRW alleged that the DEA had been engaged in a secret mass surveillance program as early as the 1990s. HRW noted that the DEA acknowledged the existence of this program in a declaration filed in January 2015 for a separate case (included as an exhibit in HRW's complaint). According to HRW, the surveillance program indiscriminately swept in call records for calls between the United States and \"Designated Countries\" that are \"determined to have a 'demonstrated nexus to international drug trafficking and related criminal activities.' \" HRW alleged that these call records were recorded in databases, which were then made accessible to the officers and employees of the DEA, DHS, and FBI. HRW claimed that during the course of its work, it communicated with individuals in Designated Countries, and that the surveillance program put HRW's contacts at risk and burdened HRW's human rights advocacy efforts.

Judge Gutierrez determined that HRW should be allowed an opportunity to conduct discovery to respond to the defendants' attack on standing, and authorized HRW to serve a limited number of interrogatories on the defendants.\n\nOn December 14, 2015, HRW filed for voluntary dismissal without prejudice, as the defendants had provided additional information through discovery concerning the destruction of call records collected in bulk.

{"document": "Plaintiffs, ACLU national and the ACLU of Wisconsin, along with Covington & Burling attorneys, filed this class action alleging that the Milwaukee Police Department's (MPD) stop-and-frisk policies were unconstitutional. The case was filed in the Eastern District of Wisconsin on February 22, 2017. The complaint alleged under Section 1983 that Milwaukee's stop-and-frisk policies violated the Fourth Amendment's search and seizure protections as well as the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. It also alleged under Section 2000d that Milwaukee was in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorney's fees and costs. \n\nThis case was brought as a class action on behalf of all persons who had been or would have been stopped by MPD officers after January 7th, 2008. More broadly, the complaint alleged that in 2008, when Milwaukee adopted a \"broken windows\" policy regarding crime prevention, MPD began engaging in high-volume, suspicion-less stops as well as stops illegally motivated by race and ethnicity. The complaint alleges a formal and informal quota system of stops that led to a threefold increase in stops from 2007 to 2015. Plaintiffs also defined a subclass of black and Latino individuals. All of the named plaintiffs in the class were black or Latino, and the complaint detailed specific allegations of suspicion-less stops for each of them as well as data indicating the impact that Milwaukee's stop-and-frisk policy had specifically on black and Latino communities.   \n\nThe parties were engaged in negotiations almost from the beginning - a Joint Interim Settlement Report was filed in September 2017, and minute orders show that the parties were engaged in mediation and later settlement negotiations throughout the fall of 2017 and into the spring and summer of 2018. A settlement was approved on July 23, 2018. The settlement covers a range of issues: changes to officer training; revisions to MPD policies and guidelines regarding reasonable suspicion and probable cause; body camera usage; data collection, coding, and publication; timely filing of reports after stops; supervision from within MPD for officers conducting stops; procedures for both external and internal complaints regarding stop-and-frisk; data auditing by MPD; hiring, counseling, retraining, and discipline; and community engagement. \n\nThe District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement under Judge J. P. Stadtmueller. To achieve compliance with the agreement, MPD must incorporate all substantive parts of the agreement into policy, hire and train needed personnel, appropriate sufficient funds, and show sustained and continuing improvement on constitutional policing based on a variety of data-based factors. The settlement terminates after five years. The ACLU and an outside consultant (CJI) will act as monitors. The settlement indicates $1,900,000 in attorney's fees and costs, and Milwaukee is also responsible for paying for CJI's fees. \n\n<b>Current status</b>\nMPD is required to provide data on variety of police and civilian interactions quarterly, and to make training and policy materials available for review.

In September, the court entered an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for individualized bail hearings. Three detainees were released in October. The defendants appealed in November. The case is ongoing. <hr>\n\nOn April 8, 2020, a group of four immigrants in detention filed this lawsuit against U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), ICE officials, and the warden of the Montgomery Processing Center (\"MPC\"). Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the petitioners sought writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Alternatively, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the petitioners argued that by detaining them, the defendants were subjecting them to an unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19 in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Keith P. Ellison.\n\nOn April 10, the plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order.\n\nOn April 17, Judge Ellison entered an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order. 455 F.Supp.3d 330. The government was required to release one plaintiff from detention because the plaintiff did not have a history of violence, so the danger to the plaintiff in detention outweighed the public interest in safety; the court issued this order as a preliminary injunction rather than a temporary restraining order. The court declined to order the release of another plaintiff due to his history of violence and violation of previous court protective orders. Ten days later that plaintiff was transferred to a different detention facility. (The two other individual plaintiffs had already been released.) \n\nOn April 29, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint with four additionally plaintiffs with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness or death if they contracted COVID-19. Two of those plaintiffs were later released on May 1. The plaintiffs also filed a motion to certify the class. The proposed class consisted of \"all individuals detained at MPC who have been diagnosed with or are receiving treatment for an enumerated list of medical conditions... and/or who are over the age of 50.\" \n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on May 1 on the basis that the plaintiffs' claims were mooted after each was either transferred or released. On May 1 and 4, the plaintiffs moved to expedite discovery and to expedite relief. In the meantime, at least six detainees and five MPC staff members had tested positive for COVID-19. \n\nOn May 25, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss because the plaintiff that secured release through the April 17 preliminary injunction still had standing to amend the complaint since her claims had not been finally adjudicated. The court also ordered that plaintiffs submit supplemental information on the proposed class certification before the court rule on the other outstanding motions. 2020 WL 2617939.\n\nDefendants filed another motion to dismiss the amended complaint on June 5. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on June 7 which was denied as moot on June 23. Several detainees filed an emergency motion to intervene on July 30 which was granted on August 31.

The court noted that by July 29, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among detainees at MPC was reported to be 206. By August 11, defendants reported zero active cases and deaths, but the court noted that it \"lack[ed] confidence in these numbers.\" The court also noted that \"the timeline of events at MPC demonstrates that, despite the measures [d]efendants allegedly implemented, the detention facility nonetheless experienced a significant outbreak of COVID-19 while those measures were already in place.\"\n\nIn October, the court granted bail for three detainees and denied bail for one detainee. 2020 WL 6130717.

{"document": "On July 27, 2010, four students with disabilities and the Hawaii Disability Rights Center filed this class action against the Hawaii Department of Education seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs, represented by Hawaii Disability Rights Center, contended that the Department was failing to comply with its obligations to provide a Free Accessible Public Education (FAPE) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and their right to a discrimination-free education under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Susan Oki Mollway. \n\nAt the time the complaint was filed, the disabled individuals who brought the suit were over twenty but under twenty-two years old and had previously received a FAPE under the IDEA. However, following the establishment of a new Hawaii Law, Act 163, these individuals were denied a FAPE because they were over twenty years of age. \n\nThe plaintiffs moved for class certification and a preliminary injunction. District Judge David Alan Ezra signed an order granting in part and denying in part the motion for class certification on March 15, 2011. 272 F.R.D. 541. The judge also issued an order denying plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2011 WL 2746800. Defendants then moved for a motion to dismiss or in the alternative, for summary judgment, and the plaintiffs renewed their motion for a preliminary injunction and moved for summary judgment. Judge Ezra then issued an order denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, granting in part and denying in part the defendant's motion to dismiss, and denying plaintiff's renewed motion for preliminary relief. 817 F.Supp.2d 1182.\n\nIn 2012, the case went to a bench trial. Judge Alan Ezra held that the plaintiffs failed to prove the Hawaii Department of Education violated the IDEA, ACA, and Rehabilitation Act and entered judgment for the defendants. 2012 WL 1082250. The case was then appealed to the Ninth Circuit. On August 28, 2013, the Ninth Circuit announced its conclusion, affirming in part and reversing in part. 728 F.3d 982. The court found that the State of Hawaii offered public education to nondisabled students between the ages of 20 and 22 through its Community Schools for Adults. The court held that so long as the State continued to provide such an education to nondisabled students under 22, it was required under IDEA to provide a FAPE to disabled students in the same age bracket. The court reversed and remanded the case on the IDEA count. The court affirmed the district court's finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the Department was required to make such changes as a \"reasonable accommodation.\" Accordingly, the court affirmed the lower court's judgement in favor of the Department on the ACA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  The court also awarded costs on appeal to the Plaintiffs. \n\nAfter being remanded to district court, and after the case was reassigned to Judge Susan Oki Mollway, the class was recertified.

{"document": "On November 15, 2007, an individual who was strip searched after being charged with a petty crime filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Represented by the Texas Civil Rights Project and private counsel, the plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging as unconstitutional Bexar County Detention Center's policy or custom of strip searching misdemeanant arrestees even where they were not suspected of concealing weapons or contraband.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiff alleged that she was arrested for an outstanding traffic warrant and taken to the Bexar County Detention Center, where she was subjected to a strip search upon admission. The plaintiff further alleged that, after being held for two days, she and 25 other pretrial detainees were ordered to change into jail-issued uniforms, at which time she was again strip searched. The plaintiffs allege that detainees were told to manipulate genitalia and sometimes \"squat and cough\" regardless of whether there was reasonable suspicion of contraband or weapons. The plaintiff claimed that the strip searches violated her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights in that they were conducted in the absence of any reasonable suspicion that she was hiding weapons or contraband. To remedy the alleged constitutional violation, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. \n\nOn April 2, 2009, both parties agreed to a consent decree that would provide permanent injunctive relief without further litigation. The decree dictated that the County Detention Center would no longer, absent reasonable suspicion that someone is concealing contraband, engage in the practice of strip searching or visual cavity searching those in their custody who are charged with misdemeanors. The County Detention Center also had to provide the court with an annual report regarding the implementation of the consent decree. Nothing in the consent decree addressed the plaintiff's request for compensatory and punitive damages. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the decree. The decree was signed by Judge Fred Biery of the Western District of Texas. \n\nOn November 16, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The parties continued to engage in discovery and settlement talks to resolve the damages claims. On August 26, 2010, the plaintiffs' submitted a motion of preliminary approval of the class-action settlement. The court preliminarily approved the settlement on October 13, 2010. After a fairness hearing, a final order of approval was granted on January 12, 2011.\n\nThe settlement agreement certified a class of plaintiffs composed of all detainees of Bexar County Detention Center between November 2005 and April 2009 who were subjected to strip searches and booked on misdemeanor or other minor charges. Those with felonies were not included. The class also had two subclasses. Subclass I was composed of all detainees not in subclass II, and subclass II included detainees booked on narcotics, shoplifting, and weapons-violation misdemeanors. All members of the class were to receive a pro rata share of the settlement after administrative expenses, attorneys' fees, and other expenses are counted for. \n\nAttorneys' fees were $900,000 for this case. The court found this reasonable considering the amount of time put in and the complexity of the case. The settlement included $395,000 for the claim administrator, and $15,000 was given to the three class representatives for their work in the lawsuit. The fund was then be used to pay class members. Class members in subclass I could receive up to $1,000, and members of subclass II can receive up to $100. Class members could pay off court fines and fees in Bexar County with their settlement funds, but this was capped at $500 and $50 for the subclasses respectively.\n\nOn January 28, 2013, however, the district court dismissed this case, thus vacating and revoking the settlement agreement. In 2012, the Supreme Court decided <i>Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington</i>, holding that jail administrators may require all arrestees committed to the general population of the jail to undergo a no-touch visual strip search, even if the detainees is booked for a minor offense or reasonable suspicion is absent. The plaintiffs, their attorneys, and class members were not required to pay back any fees or funds they were awarded, but the County no longer needed to abide by the consent decree from April 9, 2009, that details how their strip search policy is to be conducted.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that she was arrested for an outstanding traffic warrant and taken to the Bexar County Detention Center, where she was subjected to a strip search upon admission.Plaintiff claimed that the strip searches violated her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights in that they were conducted in the absence of any reasonable suspicion that she was hiding weapons or contraband.  To remedy the alleged constitutional violation, Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. \r\n\r\nOn April 2nd, 2009 both parties agreed to a consent decree that dictated that the Bexar County Detention Center would no longer, absent reasonably suspicion, engaged in strip searching of those in custody who are charged with misdemeanors. \r\n\r\nThe Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint later that year, and the two parties engaged in settlement discussions. A settlement was preliminarily approved on October 13th, and officially approved on January 12th, 2011. The Agreement certified the class of petitioners, and required the County to create a $3.5 million fund. The fund paid for $900,00 in attorneys' fees, $395,000 for administrative costs, and $15,000 fees to each of the three class representatives. It also paid for damages to be paid to class members. \r\n\r\nON January 28th, 2013 the consent decree and the settlement agreement were vacated because of a Supreme Court decisions from 2012 holding that jail administrators could conduct no-touch visual strip searches of detainees, without reasonable suspicion that they detainee has contraband.

The plaintiffs, represented by an attorney from the Milton Kramer Law Clinic at Case Western, an attorney from the Center for Constitutional Rights, and an attorney for Clifford Chance, sued the U.S. Department of Homeland security (\"DHS\") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), seeking declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief to compel the defendants to produce records related to federal government surveillance and monitoring of protest activities related to the Movement for Black Lives (\"MBL\"). \n\nFollowing the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, MBL gained national scope and influence, drawing public attention to police violence and advocating for police reform and racial justice. The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that government documents, news reports, and first-hand accounts demonstrated that the defendants, and state and local law enforcement agencies, had engaged in surveillance and monitoring of MBL demonstrations and individual activists aligned with the movement, using tactics and measures commonly reserved for counterterrorism and national security related purposes. They further alleged that this monitoring of legitimate protest activities undermined the First Amendment's protection of political speech, and would chill valuable public debate about police violence, including use of deadly force, criminal justice, and racial inequities. \n\nOn July 5 2016, the plaintiffs submitted their FOIA request to DHS and the FBI: \n\n<b>DHS</b>\nOn July 18, 2016, DHS's privacy office sent a letter to the plaintiffs acknowledging receipt of the request.

The plaintiffs appealed that decision based on the Office of Intelligence and Analysis' failure to perform an adequate search for records and its improper reliance on FOIA exemptions to avoid searching for, or producing, responsive records. On October 20, the plaintiffs received an acknowledgment from DHS regarding the appeal, but did not receive any other response or correspondence. \n\n<b>FBI</b>\nOn July 28, 2016, the FBI sent a letter acknowledging receipt of the plaintiffs' request.

During this conference, the parties agreed to the discovery schedule of 500 pages per month of responsive documents. \n\nDuring discovery, both parties narrowed the requested documents, and prepared to file motions to contest or uphold exemptions. In line with timelines set in a February 9, 2018 scheduling conference, both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment surrounding release of a non-finalized intelligence assessment titled \"(U\\\\FOUO) Growing Frequency of Race-Related Domestic Terrorist Violence.\" On July 9, 2018, Judge William Pauley ruled in favor of the defendants, saying that this document falls under FOIA's exemption 5 for process-related documents. He wrote that, because this document was written by an analyst and an intern, it revealed the processes of how DHS assesses and analyzes intelligence.\n\nWith this motion for summary judgment decided and the cooperation of the parties outside of the contested DHS memo, all issues in the case were settled outside of the allocation of attorney fees. With this in mind, after an August 7, 2018 status report, Judge Pauley filed an order to partially dismiss the case, closing all claims outside of attorney fees.\n\nThe case was briefly stayed in late 2018 and early 2019 due to the U.S. federal government shutdown.

The plaintiff suffered from gender dysphoria and—despite her feminine appearance—the defendant assigned her to a maximum-security male prison. In these facilities, transgender inmates often face the highest risk of sexual violence. \n\nThe plaintiff brought this action in the Middle District of Georgia on February 19, 2015 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the defendant staff at the Georgia Department of Corrections, Rutledge State Prison, and Valdosta State prison. The plaintiff claimed deliberate indifference to her medical needs in denying medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria, violations of her Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment, failure of guards to protect her from serious sexual assault, and failure to train prison personnel regarding transgender inmates' health and safety. Represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and private counsel, the plaintiff requested declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the Georgia Department of Corrections to adhere to professional standards of care in treating inmates that suffer from gender dysphoria. \n\nThe plaintiff was first imprisoned in 2012. Within the first month of her imprisonment, the plaintiff was sexually assaulted by six gang members.

The court then ruled on the defendants' various motions to dismiss on September 14, 2015. First, the plaintiff's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief were mooted and dismissed without prejudice as a result of her release from prison. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's deliberate indifference to a serious medical need claim and failure-to-protect claim because the plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Further, the court held that defendant prison personnel were not entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiff's deliberate indifference to a serious medical need claim and that the defendant medical director was not entitled to qualified immunity on the failure-to-protect claim. Finally, the court held that the plaintiff sufficiently pleaded that defendant medical director failed to train subordinates regarding the safety of transgender inmates and that this failure resulted in deliberate indifference to Diamond’s constitutional right to reasonable protection—the defendant medical director was not entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.  \n\nThe parties reached an undisclosed monetary settlement and filed a stipulated dismissal on February 11, 2016. \n\nAs a result of the lawsuit, the Georgia Department of Corrections no longer uses the “freeze frame” policy that prohibited transgender inmates from receiving treatment or updating treatment plans as needed.

These prevention policies are supplemented by training programs for prison staffers that address the unique needs of transgender inmates. The case is now closed.

The plaintiffs, represented by a combination of public interest and private attorneys, sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the State from enforcing Public Act 118, also known as Roger’s Law, which plaintiffs alleged put significant barriers in place for college aged students who wanted to vote. The case was assigned to District Judge Robert H. Cleland.\n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs claimed that Roger’s Law placed two major barriers in the way of students seeking to vote: Strict matching requirements and requirement that a person first vote in person. The strict matching requirement prohibited college students, who had their home address listed on state identification, from using said identification to register to vote in their college town. The in-person voting requirement prohibited college students, who would need to return to their permanent addresses to vote, from voting if they were far from home. Plaintiff claimed that these laws were driven to enactment by discriminatory intent, as shown through the explicit statement by the legislation’s drafter that he didn’t care if college-aged students couldn’t vote.\n\nThe complaint was later amended on September 7th, 2018, to add new plaintiffs, specifically more student groups. \n\nOn September 8th, 2018, a motion for preliminary injunction was filed, but stayed while the parties negotiated a potential settlement.

{"document": "This case is one of several federal cases challenging the Trump Administration’s ongoing attempts to reduce Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).    The case arose from federal and state efforts to limit the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Medicaid, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, requires states to cover all individuals of a mandatory covered population group and prohibits states from imposing additional eligibility requirements. However, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act allows DHHS to waive certain federal Medicaid requirements when necessary to allow a state to carry out an experimental project that is likely to promote the Act’s objectives. \n\nIn 2010, the ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to include adults with household incomes less than 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Michigan passed legislation authorizing the Medicaid expansion but sought a waiver under Section 1115 to require new enrollees to pay premiums and copayments that could be reduced by the individual’s engagement in certain “healthy behaviors.” For enrollees with incomes above the FPL, the monthly premium was set at two percent of the individual’s income. DHHS granted the waiver application, effective through December 31, 2018, but specified that no individual may lose or be denied Medicaid eligibility for failure to pay premiums or copayments.\n\nIn January 2018, DHHS issued a letter to state Medicaid directors announcing its intention to approve Medicaid waiver applications containing work requirements. This action was consistent with President Trump's January 20, 2017 executive order instructing federal agencies to scale back the ACA “[t]o the maximum extent permitted by law.\" \n\nIn response, Michigan submitted a Section 1115 waiver application that would add mandatory work requirements. The work requirements consisted of 80 hours of specified work or work-related activities per month and mandatory monthly reporting of work activities, with the loss of coverage for enrollees who do not report the required hours for three months in a 12-month period. The application also included mandatory healthy behaviors and heightened, mandatory premiums for enrollees with incomes above the FPL who received coverage for 48 cumulative months. Failure to pay a premium within 60 days after the invoice date would result in termination of coverage. Enrollees in the same subgroup also had to complete a health risk assessment or specified healthy behaviors in the 12 months before their annual redetermination to remain eligible. \n\nDHHS approved these three HMP waivers, effective January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023, and granted Michigan permission to implement the measures starting January 1, 2020. The work requirements went into effect on January 1, 2020. The state deferred the implementation of the healthy behavior requirements and new premium requirements until October 1, 2020.\n\nThe plaintiffs, all members of Michigan’s Medicaid program, filed this class-action lawsuit on November 22, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The plaintiffs challenged amendments to the Healthy Michigan Plan (HMP), including work requirements that would result in the loss of health coverage for 61,000 to 183,000 individuals. Represented by the National Health Law Program, the Center for Civil Justice, and the Michigan Poverty Law Program, the plaintiffs requested an injunction against the defendants’ implementation of Michigan’s amended HMP eligibility requirements and declaratory relief. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants failed to undergo the required rule-making process in issuing a new policy on Medicaid waivers and acted outside the scope of their waiver authority under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act in approving Michigan’s application that imposed additional Medicaid eligibility requirements. According to the plaintiffs, these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 551 <i>et seq.</i>), the Social Security Act, and the Take Care Clause in Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution.  The plaintiffs sued on their behalf and on behalf of all Michigan residents enrolled in the HMP on or after January 1, 2019.  \n\nOn February 19, 2020 the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) filed an unopposed motion to intervene, which was granted the next day.  On February 25, 2020, MDHHS filed a motion for partial summary judgment solely on the issue of whether the federal approval of the work and community-engagement requirements in the HMP section 1115 demonstration project was lawful.  In light of the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision in <i>Gresham v. Azar</i>, striking down the work requirements of the Arkansas Medicaid program under the Section 115 waiver, Judge Boasberg granted MDHHS’s motion for partial summary judgment.  The December 21, 2018 approval of the work and community engagement requirements in the Healthy Michigan Plan Amended Demonstration Extension Application by the defendant, Secretary Azar, was vacated.  Michigan could not enforce the Medicaid work or community engagement requirements that went into effect on January 1, 2020.\n\nOn April 2, 2020, MDHHS filed a motion to stay in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The same day, the court granted the motion and the case is stayed until the earlier of 1) the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, or 2) 45 days before the date Michigan begins to implement the premiums that are conditions of continued Medicaid eligibility or the healthy behavior requirements that are conditions of continued Medicaid eligibility.\n\nAs of June 2020, the Medicaid work and community engagement requirements cannot be enforced.  The plaintiffs challenged the  payment of premium and cost sharing, community engagement, and healthy behavior components of the HMP.  The plaintiffs did not specifically challenge the rest of the waiver, but the complaint asked the court to permanently enjoin the entire HMP.  When the case resumes, the court will need to decide on the appropriate remedy, whether to disband the entire HMP, or to only vacate some or all of the specifically challenged portions. \n\n<b>Background</b>\n\nMedicaid beneficiaries in four other states have filed similar suits challenging the Administration's use of Section 1115 waiver authority. See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16440\"><i>Stewart v. Azar</i></a> (Kentucky), <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17162\"><i>Gresham v. Azar</i></a> (Arkansas), <i>Philbrick v. Azar</i> (New Hampshire), and <i>Rose v. Azar</i> (Indiana). In <i>Stewart v. Azar</i>, the court struck down Kentucky's waiver, which included work requirements, on the basis that the agency failed to sufficiently consider the impact of the proposed project on Medicaid coverage. Similarly, in <i>Gresham v. Azar</i>, the court found that the agency failed to adequately consider how the imposition of work requirements in Arkansas's program would lead to loss of coverage for a substantial number of beneficiaries including the needy, a core group under Medicaid.", "summary": "This is one of a series of cases challenging the Trump Administration's decision to allow states to impose eligibility requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries. A group of Michigan Medicaid beneficiaries sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to block its decision to allow Michigan to impose work requirements and payment obligations on them. The plaintiffs claimed that DHHS' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Social Security Act, and the Constitution.  The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services intervened, and filed a motion for partial summary judgment on federal approval of the work and community-engagement requirements of the Healthy Michigan Plan.  The court granted this motion, declaring federal approval of these provisions unlawful.  Michigan cannot enforce the Medicaid work and community engagement requirements.

{"document": "On February 29, 2016, a U.S. Army Captain and member of the Sikh faith filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sued the United States Department of Defense and the Army, among others, under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The plaintiff, represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the Sikh Coalition, and private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief prohibiting the U.S. Army from forcing him to compromise his religious exercise. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the U.S. Army violated his First Amendment right to free expression of his religion. The defendants had required him to undergo extensive and repetitive testing to confirm that he could properly wear a combat helmet and a safety mask, while other soldiers with long hair and beards had not been subjected to the same testing.  \n\nPrior to this action, the plaintiff was given temporary accommodations to keep his hair and beard unshorn and to wear a turban. However, these accommodations were set to expire on March 31. On February 29, the plaintiff filed a temporary restraining order preventing the defendants from subjecting him to non-standard or discriminatory testing. On March 3, Judge Beryl A. Howard granted the plaintiff’s motion and enjoined the defendants from subjecting the plaintiff to any such testing during the pendency of the litigation. 168 F.Supp.3d 216.\n\nThe plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on February 29, requesting that the U.S. Army grant him a permanent religious accommodation for his beard, hair, and turban. Judge Howell denied this motion on May 6, 2016, partially because the preliminary injunction would essentially encompass the relief sought in the underlying complaint. In the same memorandum opinion, Judge Howell also denied the plaintiff’s motion to consolidate his case with another Sikh accommodation case because the plaintiffs in that case were reservists awaiting training rather than a West Point graduate on active duty as in this case. Additionally, the plaintiffs in the second case had not been forced to undergo the same testing that this plaintiff had objected to. 185 F. Supp. 3d 11.\n\nOn March 31, 2016, the defendants filed a notice that they had extended the plaintiff’s temporary accommodation to one year, or less in the event that military necessity assigned the plaintiff to another unit. In response, on May 23, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint stating that the extension did not negate the Army’s discriminatory regulations and practices. On June 20, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. \n\nOn July 4, 2016, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice. In his filing, the plaintiff’s dismissal was made with the expectation that Sikh Americans would be successfully integrated into the U.S. military outside the context of this legal proceeding. This conclusion was supported by the following facts: (1) the defendants granted the plaintiff a ‘long-term accommodation’ which extended his earlier accommodation for at least one year from March 31, 2016; (2) the defendants had repeatedly written assurances that the plaintiff would not be subject to heightened, individualized testing concerning his helmet and safety mask; (3) while the Assistant Secretary of the Army intended to re-evaluate the plaintiff’s accommodation the following year, the plaintiff would not need to submit a new accommodation request; (4) the defendants planned to develop uniform standards for religious accommodations; (5) the plaintiff was not required to submit a new accommodation request with every new assignment, transfer of duty station, etc.; (6) no change would be made to the plaintiff’s accommodation without the evaluation being expeditiously forwarded to the Assistant Secretary; and (7) that a modification that substantially burdened the plaintiff’s religious exercise would only be permissible where the defendants could prove that they had a compelling interest to require modification, that modification was in furtherance of that interest, and that there was no less restrictive means of furthering that interest. These facts indicated that the plaintiff would not be subjected to adverse treatment by virtue of his faith for at least one year, by which time the plaintiff expected that the army would have legally sufficient accommodation guidelines in place. \n\nOn July 5, 2016, the case was dismissed without prejudice and signed by Judge Beryl A.

{"document": "During 2003, a law professor residing in Illinois developed a mental illness.  Due to this illness, a state court appointed the Office of State Guardian as guardian of his person and, in 2004, of his estate.  He moved to Missouri, where a petition was soon filed to appoint a guardian for him.  The guardianship in Illinois did not affect his eligibility to vote while residing there, but the guardianship adjudication had a different, prohibitive impact on his voting rights in Missouri.  Thus, in October 2004, the former professor, as plaintiff and by the Office of State Guardian, filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, naming as defendants Missouri's governor, attorney general, and several city election officials.  The plaintiff alleged that, previously, he had been adjudged mentally incapacitated and appointed a guardian and, presently, would like to register to vote for, and to vote in, upcoming elections.  Missouri, however, had a constitutional provision and a statute that barred incapacitated persons and those under guardianship from registering to vote and from voting.  Alleging that these state laws denied him his fundamental right to vote and violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses, as well as statutory (and related regulatory) rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C § 12131 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys fees and costs.  Numerous attorneys represented the plaintiff, including those from Illinois' Guardianship and Advocacy Commission, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the ACLU National Voting Rights Project, and the ACLU of Eastern Missouri.\n\nThe plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction was denied in an unpublished opinion by District Judge Ortrie Smith on October 26, 2004.  The judge ruled that it would be inappropriate to issue injunctive relief when the plaintiff had other means of protecting his voting rights, such as seeking in state court proceedings that any guardianship order applicable to him be limited in a way that allowed for him to vote.\n\nIn December 2004, an amended complaint was filed.  It made essentially the same attacks upon the state's limitations on voting eligibility, but added two additional individual plaintiffs under guardianship orders and one associational plaintiff, the Missouri Protection and Advocacy Services, Inc. (\"MOPAS\").  It also added another federal constitutional claim, alleging that the full faith and credit clause was violated by Missouri's law, since deprivation of voting rights occurred in Missouri based upon an Illinois adjudication that did not expressly deprive one of voting rights.\n\nAlso in December 2004, the Missouri probate court acted upon the petition for appointment of a guardian for the original plaintiff.  In an unpublished ruling, Circuit Judge Joan Moriarty found that the Illinois guardianship order had no extraterritorial effect and that the Illinois guardian had exceeded its authority in moving the plaintiff to a Missouri psychiatric facility.  The judge directed that the Illinois guardian move the plaintiff to an Illinois facility.  The probate court's ruling, however, was reversed on appeal eight months later.  Appellate Judge Gary M. Gaertner, Sr., writing for a panel of the Missouri Court of Appeals, found that the Illinois guardianship order was entitled to recognition and enforcement under the federal constitution's full faith and credit clause, particularly given Missouri statutes that reflected a willingness to recognize guardianship judgments without regard to the location of the guardian or the ward.  Thus, the Illinois guardian had acted appropriately in moving the plaintiff to Missouri.  That the ward had been moved back to Illinois did not fully moot the case, according to the appellate panel, due to the significance of the lower court's erroneous ruling.  In re Prye, 168 S.W.3d 116 (Mo. App. 2005).\n\nThe federal case proceeded, in the meantime, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  These were ruled upon by Judge Smith on July 7, 2006, in an unpublished order.  By this time, two of the individual plaintiffs had been dismissed from the case at their request (including the original plaintiff), leaving MOPAS and a plaintiff under a Missouri guardianship order as the challengers to the Missouri laws.  Judge Smith first decided that the election board's recent issuance of a voter registration card to the individual plaintiff did not moot the case, because the defendants had not met their burden of showing the permanence of their voluntary cessation of the alleged wrongful conduct.  Next, he ruled that the state's use of a guardianship scheme that required individualized determination of a person's abilities and limitations sufficiently allowed for differentiating those who are qualified to vote from those who are not and, so, did not violate the federal constitution or statutes.  Additionally, the opportunity for review and modification of state guardianship orders gave wards recourse to protect their interests in voting.  Accordingly, Judge Smith granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n\nPlaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  On August 23, 2007, that court affirmed the district court, although on somewhat different grounds.  In an opinion by Circuit Judge James B. Loken, the court rejected the state's assertion of the Eleventh Amendment as a bar to suit against the state officials, since the named state defendants had \"some connection\" to enforcement of the allegedly unconstitutional law.  The state's arguments fared better, however, on the merits.  Judge Loken noted that the state guardianship scheme did not categorically disenfranchise persons under full guardianship, since the state's courts retained authority to preserve a ward's right to vote in accordance with the state's statutory mandate to minimize deprivation of a ward's liberty.  Thus, the state law did not deny equal protection or federal statutory rights, given the law's lack of a categorical bar to voting.  Further, the court ruled that the advocacy group plaintiff (MOPAS) lacked standing to bring suit on behalf of mere constituents, who lacked the active relationship to the organization that exists when membership exists.  Without participation by a ward who had been denied the right to vote because a guardian was appointed for reasons other than mental incapacity, MOPAS' assertion of the rights of such a hypothetical plaintiff was \"too abstract,\" according to Judge Loken, who saw MOPAS as asking for an impermissible advisory opinion.  Missouri Protection and Advocacy Services, Inc., v. Carnahan, 499 F.3d 803 (8th Cir. 2007).\n\nLikewise, the remaining individual plaintiff could not prevail, since his local election board had denied him the right to vote in error, not noting that his guardianship order expressly allowed him to retain that right.  The board, noting the error after he had been added to the case as a plaintiff, issued him a voter registration card.  This made his pending claim for injunctive relief moot, as there was no reasonable expectation that the earlier error would be repeated.  Further, he had no standing to assert the rights of others and had not been injured by the alleged flaws in the Missouri voting laws, since his voting rights had been preserved in the guardianship order.  Id.\n\nEfforts to seek rehearing and rehearing en banc were denied on October 18, 2007.  After the appellate ruling in favor of the defendants became final, no further material activity occurred in this case.\n\nThe case is now closed.", "summary": "Several Missouri residents with adjudged mental incapacities and appointed guardianship were barred from registering to vote and voting in elections in the state of Missouri. The individuals filed a civil suit in the Western District of Missouri against Missouri's governor, attorney general, and several election officials for violating their fundamental right to vote. The Federal District Court granted the defendant's motion for summary on the grounds that, because the state's guardianship scheme required individualized determination of a person's abilities and qualifications to vote, it did not violate the federal constitution or statutes. On plaintiff's appeal, the decision was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit for several reasons, including a similar reason to the District Court that the state guardianship scheme did not categorically disenfranchise all persons under full guardianship, and for the remaining plaintiffs' lack of standing."}

For violations of their constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the plaintiffs asked the Court for preliminary and permanent injunctions.  \n\nOn May 8, 2006, the court (Judge Robert W. Gettleman) certified a class consisting of individuals held for more than 10 business days without a preliminary parole revocation hearing.

{"document": "On March 14, 2013, the United States Department of Justice filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The United States sued a Marion County-owned skilled nursing facility, the operation of which was largely funded through Medicaid, under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), alleging that the Defendant had a practice of violating the constitutional and statutory rights of residents at the nursing home.  \n\nSpecifically, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant deliberately disregarded known harm or serious risks of harm to residents, and that its actions and failures to act caused harm to residents, including unnecessary segregation, and physical, mental and psychological harm. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant was violating the ADA by failing to serve individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, by not taking sufficient steps to assess, identify, and prepare individuals for discharge from the facility to programs in the community. The Plaintiff also alleged the Defendant failed to adequately screen individuals who are required by federal law to be screened before admission, resulting in individuals being served in a more restrictive setting than appropriate to their needs.  \n\nThe Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendant’s healthcare services “substantially depart from professional standards,” and thus failed to provide adequate healthcare, a constitutionally protected right. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to monitor, evaluate, update, or review individual’s care plans, despite new diagnoses or changes in conditions. For example, the Plaintiff alleged that on multiple occasions, residents showing symptoms of a stroke or began to foam at the mouth sometimes waited hours before nursing staff noticed or notified a physician.  These failures allegedly resulted in unnecessary harm, including hospitalization, preventable falls, and a decline in functional abilities.\n\nConcurrently with the Complaint, the United States filed a settlement agreement, which it had already negotiated with the Defendant. The settlement involved a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment, and mandated improvements in three areas: (1) placement in the most integrated settings, (2) conditions of care and treatment, and (3) protection from harm. \n\nOn March 22, 2013, Judge Charles A. Shaw for the United States District for the Eastern District of Missouri issued an order entering the settlement agreement as an order of the court. The Agreement provided for a third party to serve as the Monitor of compliance with the Agreement. The Agreement provided that it should terminate when the Defendant achieved substantial compliance with each provision of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance with the Agreement for a period of two years.\n\nFirst, to ensure placement in the most integrated settings, the Agreement required the Defendant to conduct adequate pre-admission evaluations to ensure that individuals were not inappropriately admitted to the facility. The Defendant was also required to implement a discharge and transition process to ensure that individuals who could be served in more integrated settings were identified and that such individuals would be part of a robust and individualized discharge planning process and implementation. The Agreement also provided for “in-reach” by community service providers to residents to actively support them in moving to more integrated settings.\n\nThe Agreement established specific requirements for the “care plan,” or formal written individualized plan of treatment, required for each individual living at the nursing home and those at risk of being institutionalized there. \n\nThe Defendant was required to implement a quality assurance process to oversee the discharge and transition process. It was required to review this information on a quarterly basis, and on an annual basis, create a report summarizing its quality assurance activities, findings, and recommendations, and evaluate whether it had been effective in addressing the barriers preventing individuals from receiving services in the most integrated, appropriate settings. \n\nSecond, to improve the Defendant's conditions of care and treatment, the Agreement required the Defendant to provide individuals at Maple Lawn with adequate and appropriate protections, treatment, supports, and services to meet the individualized needs of the individuals and that are consistent with generally accepted professional standards. This involved the following: improving health care assessments and care plans, establishing an effective infection control program to minimize the spread of infections or communicable diseases, ensuring that nutrition and hydration services as well as aspiration prevention care were sufficient, improving its psychiatric and psychosocial services, specifically its policies about psychotropic medication, improving pressure sore prevention and treatment policies, providing adequate pain management services, mortality reviews for individuals who die at the Defendant’s facility or at an acute-care facility after being transferred from the Defendant’s facility, and annual quality assurance reporting.\n\nThird, the Defendant was required to provide individuals with a safe and secure environment and ensure protection from harm. The Agreement mandated improvements in the Defendant's fall prevention and reporting policies, adequate reporting and investigation of all incidents where individuals sustain injuries, and annual quality assurance reporting.\n\nThe Agreement provided for a third party to serve as the Monitor of compliance with the Agreement. The Agreement provided that it should terminate when the Defendant achieved substantial compliance with each provision of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance with the Agreement for a period of two years.\n\nThe Monitor’s first Semi-Annual Compliance Report was adopted by the Defendant and filed with the court on September 19, 2013.\n\nOn January 30, 2014, the Plaintiff and Defendant filed a joint statement regarding Defendant’s compliance with the settlement agreement, informing the court that they both agreed with the Monitor’s finding that as of January 15, 2014, the Defendant had achieved substantial compliance with the terms of the Agreement.\n\nFor the next two years, the Monitor and Defendant filed semi-annual reports on compliance with the settlement agreement.\n\nOn April 15, 2016, the Plaintiff and Defendant filed a joint stipulation and motion for dismissal, in which they agreed and stipulated that the Defendant achieved substantial compliance on January 15, 2014 and remained in substantial compliance at all times through January 15, 2016.

{"document": "On 06/28/1993, inmates at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility filed a Section 1983 class action suit, pro se, in the Southern District of Ohio against officials in Youngstown, Ohio of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.  Plaintiffs' claims were related to the treatment of prisoners during the prison riot that occurred in April 1993.  Plaintiffs alleged that defendants locked as many as ten inmates in a cell, failed to protect them from violence, did not provide them with water or working toilets, used excessive force, destroyed personal property, and denied medical care.  \n\nIn December 1993, Magistrate Judge Robert A. Steinberg appointed several private lawyers and certified the class.  By the summer of 1994, counsel, along with their expert Steven Martin, negotiated an end to the post-riot lockdown of general population inmates.  By February 1995, counsel negotiated with Defendants for a special Rules Infraction Board to handle the cases of inmates against whom administrative charges for riot-related, violent misconduct were filed.\n\nFollowing extensive discovery, the parties reached an agreement and signed the Class Action Memorandum of Understanding in January 1997. The settlement included two major parts.  First, the settlement established terms to improve the \"\"quality of life\"\" including: single-celling maximum security inmates; modifying the inmate classification system; improving racial and cultural relations; securing at least forty hours of out-of-cell time per week;  and instituting new state-wide directives on religious practices.  Second, the settlement established a $4.1 million fund, from which inmate damage claims, attorneys' fees and expenses would be paid.  The  case was dismissed conditional on completion of the reforms specified in the settlement agreement.  Following a fairness hearing, the District Court (Judge S. Arthur Spiegel) approved the settlement in April 1997.  \n\nMichael R. Barrett was named Special Master and has filed several status reports regarding the distribution of the fund.  However, extensive litigation  continued regarding the distribution of the fund and attorneys' fees.  \n\nOn December 12, 1999, the District Court (Judge Spiegel) approved a recommendation by the claims administrator that the two class representatives be paid $7,500 apiece.\nThe stated basis for these awards was that \"the class representatives performed important work on behalf of the other members of class and class counsel,\" serving as a \"crucial link for class members and counsel throughout the proceedings\" and keeping the \"class members generally informed in the progress of the case and relay[ing] information back to\nclass counsel.\" In a subsequent order, the district court stayed its grant of incentive awards pending appeal. \n\nIn 2001, the Sixth Circuit (Judge David A. Nelson) reversed the district court's decision to grant incentive awards to the two named plaintiffs and place all inmates' claim determinations under protective order.  In re Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, 2001 WL 1667267 (6th Cir. 2001).  \n\nOn November 4, 2002, Judge Spiegel entered an order granting class counsel's request for an order increasing the awards to class members pro rata and ordering the settlement master/trustee to distribute $500,000 to be awarded on a pro rata basis on each claimant's previous award totals.  In 2004, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court's disbursement of unassigned funds to certain prisoner-class members.  The court held that the settlement agreement did not authorize the district court to make a pro rata distribution of the remaining settlement funds.  Morris v. Voinovich, 2004 WL 1745781 (6th Cir. 2004).  \n\nOn January 20, 2005, Judge Spiegel approved the joint motion of the parties to distribute the remainder of the settlement fund.  The remaining funds are to be used to support two re-entry caseworkers who will work with the class members to help them succeed on release. The court also acknowledged that sufficient effort had been made to attempt to track down all members of the class, and that the funds allocated to the former inmates who could not be traced were returned to the general pool. A second order on the same day awarded attorney’s fees to counsel representing the class. Funds were distributed between 2005 and 2007. The case is now closed.

The court certified the class and the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the case. The memorandum of understanding outlined the steps Defendant would take to improve conditions of confinement and to address the deprivations of rights that occurred after the 1993 prison riot. The first component of the settlement agreement provides for an agreement on 11 issues aimed to improve the quality of inmate life. Among there are initiatives to review the housing and transfer policies and to improve racial, cultural, and religious relations. The second component of the settlement agreement established a $4.1 million fund, from which claims and attorneys fees would be paid. Claims were to be paid at the recommendation of the claims administrator, with any residual amounts to be used for inmate programming.

They sued Disability Rights Idaho (“DRI”) under Idaho Code § 10-1201 et seq., (Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act), and Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 57. At the request of the defendant, Disability Rights Idaho, Inc. (DRI), the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Idaho on September 8, 2014. On September 18, 2014 DRI filed a counterclaim under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. DRI sought injunctive and declaratory relief to challenge the refusal of the Coroner to provide timely access to the records sought.

(“PAIMI”). (PAIMI is a federal mandate that gives authority to investigate complaints of abuse, neglect, due process and rights violations in public and private facilities that provide overnight mental health treatment.) The dispute arose when the Ada County Coroner refused to provide its investigatory records relating to a suicide death of an individual, who had been residing in an inpatient behavioral health unit of an Ada County hospital. The Coroner denied DRI’s request for non-public records and initiated this declaratory judgment action in State court in response to DRI’s letter that stated they would initiate a federal lawsuit if necessary.  DRI submitted an answer to the Coroner’s complaint and a counterclaim. \n\nOn June 15, 2015 both parties submitted Motions for Summary Judgment. In addition, DRI submitted a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Ada County Coroner argued that regardless of PAIMI, DRI did not have the right to access the Coroner’s records of its death investigation, because the Coroner was not an “agency” as defined by PAIMI. The Coroner had also cited federal and state privacy concerns and questioned DRI’s probable cause to investigate the death. On July 20, 2015, the Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest stating that federal law was clear that P&A’s had broad access to investigatory records relating to mental health treatment facilities.

The plaintiffs sued the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, the Nevada Division of Child and Family Services, Clark County, and lark County Department of Family Services under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law. (Previously, NCYL had filed a similar suit on behalf of another group of children, <i>Clark K. v.

That case can be found at <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14916\">CW-NV-0002</a> in this Clearinghouse.) \n\nBack in this case, the plaintiffs alleged that County and State officials failed to protect the health and safety of children in foster care. According to the complaint, foster children in the county were denied stability, health care, and, in many cases, even the most minimal level of safety. Many children were taken from their homes only to be subjected to physical, sexual, or psychological abuse while in the county's custody. For example, child welfare officials placed an infant and her older brother in a foster home where the baby was locked in a closet, and her brother was beaten when he tried to help her. Another plaintiff was shuttled through 40 placements in the 15 years she was in foster care. Another child was hospitalized twice in the ICU for near organ failure after being given an overdose of psychotropic drugs.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought money damages for thirteen children named in the lawsuit, and systematic improvements for several classes of children that represent more than half of the 3,600 children in foster care in the county. The suit also sought improvements for children who had not had guardians <i>ad litem</i> appointed to represent them in court, children who had not been provided early intervention services, and children who were sent to foster parents without case plans that contain the information needed to properly care for them.\n\nIn May 2010, the defendants moved to dismiss this case for failure to state a claim. After extensive hearings and related motions, on Oct. 26, 2010, U.S. District Judge Robert C. Jones dismissed the action, holding that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the plaintiffs failed to assert a clearly established constitutional right. 2010 WL 4362809 (D. Nev. Oct. 26, 2010). The plaintiffs, however, then appealed. On May 4, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling that foster children have a clearly established constitutional right to safety and adequate medical care. 678 F.3d 991 (9th Cir. 2012) (Fletcher, J.).\n\nOn remand, the district court ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint and the defendants to respond. On July 20, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in August 2012, the defendants moved to dismiss. Because of the delay that caused by the appeal, however, the plaintiffs had aged out of foster care, moved home with their families, or had been adopted. As a result of the plaintiffs exiting foster care, the district court on remand ruled on February 27, 2013 that only relief in the form of money damages would be available to them, except for the two plaintiffs that remained in the foster care system. 2013 WL 759479 (D. Nev. Feb. 27, 2013).

Represented by Immigration Equality and private pro bono counsel, plaintiffs sued the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS -- a component agency of DHS), seeking to compel recognition of their same-sex marriages and non-discriminatory adjudication of marriage-based immigrant benefits. \n\nUnder DOMA, marriage \"means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.\" 1 U.S.C. § 7.  In each of the plaintiff couples, one spouse is American and the other foreign; if the marriage were not same-sex, the American spouse could petition for an immigrant visa for the foreign spouse and place the foreign spouse on the path to lawful permanent residence and citizenship. However, following DOMA's direction, USCIS has denied plaintiffs those immigration benefits.  Plaintiffs argue that this denial is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, constituting discrimination on account of both sexual orientation and sex. \n\nThe Obama administration has announced that in its view, DOMA is unconstitutional and has therefore declined to defend it in court (although the federal government continues to enforce the statute).

{"document": "By filing a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas on February 6, 2008, which they amended on April 7, 2008, and again on September 16, 2008, nine named plaintiffs brought a class action lawsuit naming, as defendants, the U.S. State Department and the United States.  The plaintiffs alleged that each had been born in the U.S. years earlier, with the births occurring not in a medical facility but typically attended by a midwife who, for some, registered the birth as occurring in the U.S.  Recently, each plaintiff had applied for a U.S. passport.  Rather than adjudicate their applications by granting or denying each a passport, the State Department requested additional proof of U.S. citizenship from each.  After supplying additional proof, the plaintiffs alleged that, usually, the agency did not acknowledge its receipt and, instead, advised the plaintiffs that their applications would be filed \"without further action.\"  To the plaintiffs, this kind of stalling non-decision was how the agency avoided legal formalities and approvals required to actually deny a passport application and constituted, effectively, denial.  The plaintiffs' U.S. citizenship assertions were often complicated by their having also been registered in Mexico as having been born there.  Bogus Mexican birth registrations, filed by their parents, typically made the plaintiffs eligible for health benefits or school in that country when, at times, the parents resided there.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought to represent a national class consisting of \"all persons who have filed or will in the future file applications for United States passports, in whose cases, on or after April 8, 2003, the defendants did, or will in the future, 'file' or 'close' their applications without formally adjudicating them.\"  The plaintiffs alleged that their inability to travel freely, resulting from the effective denial of their passport applications, significantly and unlawfully restricted their liberty.  They sought a declaratory judgment under 8 U.S.C. § 1503 that the named plaintiffs were, in fact, U.S. citizens; a class-wide declaratory judgment that defendants had violated due process by failing to adjudicate and otherwise obstructing the class's applications, and corresponding injunctive relief; a class-wide declaratory judgment that defendants had violated equal protection by treating the class differently from similarly situated U.S. citizens of different race, ethnicity or ancestry, and corresponding injunctive relief; a class-wide declaration that defendants had violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 703, by acting arbitrarily and capriciously, and corresponding injunctive relief; a writ of mandamus compelling the defendants to actually adjudicate the applications and issue the passports; and attorneys' fees and costs. Plaintiffs also initially sought habeas relief, but dropped this cause of action in their second amended complaint.\n\nOn October 15, 2008, the defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Over the course of the following six months, several individual plaintiffs obtained their passports and voluntarily dismissed their claims.\n\nOn June 26, 2009, the parties informed the District Court that they had come to a agreement. Under the terms of their proposed settlement, the defendants agreed to re-adjudicate the applications of the class without denying them solely because an applicant had been birthed by a midwife on defendants' list of suspected or known birth certificate forgers, and to waive fees if the class member made a request by June 1, 2010. Defendants also agreed to train their employees on re-adjudication under the terms of the settlement, to give notice to the class, and to pay attorneys' fees of $150,000. The Court was to retain only contingent jurisdiction to mediate disputes over the settlement should the other dispute resolution mechanisms listed be exhausted, and the settlement was to last for two years and eleven months.\n\nThe parties moved for preliminary approval and class certification for settlement purposes, and the Court (Judge Randy Crane) granted their motion on July 7, 2009.\n\nAfter hearing objections from individuals who wanted to be covered by the settlement but who had been denied passports and were thus not part of the class, and responses from the parties, who pointed out that the objectors were not bound by the settlement and could thus still bring their own claims, the Court (Judge Crane) gave its final approval to the settlement on August 14, 2009.\n\n(Note that on July 2, 2009, the Court approved the motion of three plaintiffs to sever their individual claims under 8 U.S.C. § 1503 for declarations that they were U.S. citizens, and created the separate case of Castelano v. Rice, No. 7:09-cv-00177, to address these claims.

The complaint alleged that the New York State Office of Mental Health [OMH] and the New York State Department of Correctional Services [DOCS] were deliberately indifferent to the serious mental health needs of state prisoners with mental illness, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act.  Specifically, plaintiff alleged that a cycle of torment existed within the New York state prison system: a lack of adequate mental health care resulted in the placement of prisoners with mental illness in isolated confinement, which in turn caused greater psychiatric harm to those prisoners.

The plaintiffs were represented the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and private counsel, and alleged that Wet Seal, Inc., and related corporations, which sell women's clothing in Wet Seal and Arden B. retail stores., had engaged in racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. The plaintiffs filed the retaliation claims on their own behalf and the discrimination claims as a class action on behalf of black current or former store-management employees.  The complaint sought injunctive relief, including reinstatement and monetary relief in the form of back pay, front pay, attorneys' fees, punitive damages, and compensation for emotional distress.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the defendant discriminated against black employees in hiring, pay, promotion, and discipline, in comparison to similarly situated white employees. Plaintiffs further argued that senior level company management discriminated against black employees by firing them on account of their race and without cause. Senior-level management had pursued a racially discriminatory brand image of white women, preferably with blond hair and blue eyes, especially in markets with a greater percentage of white clientele, by instructing various levels of management to \"diversify\" stores with largely black employees by hiring more white employees and firing black employees. The plaintiffs claimed that their difficulty in obtaining subsequent employment was due to retaliation for resisting the defendant's discriminatory policies, alleging that the defendant had failed to provide fair references, and in one case, even failed to verify employment.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, that among other amendments, added another named plaintiff and new claims: a claim for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e) and claims for retaliation and hostile work environment under Title VII on behalf of individual plaintiffs.\n\nOn May 8, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a class action settlement, preliminary approval of settlement class, appointment of plaintiffs' counsel as class counsel, approval of notice plan and distribution of notice, and setting schedule for final approval.

{"document": "On January 8, 2016, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover property seized by the NYPD after an arrest. The case was assigned to Judge Denise L. Cote. The individual plaintiff was arrested in November 2014, and his iPhone and $1,399 in wages were seized by police. In his criminal case, which was dismissed in May 2015, he was represented by the Bronx Defenders, who are the second plaintiff to this lawsuit. The Bronx Defenders, a non-profit organization that provides criminal defense and civil legal services to law-income people in the Bronx, also assists hundreds of clients every year who are attempting to retrieve property seized pursuant to an arrest. Together they brought this lawsuit against the City of New York under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the city violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory damages for the individual plaintiff for the monies seized from him at his arrest, the replacement costs for his iPhone, and all applicable interest. \n\nAccording to the complaint, after a person is arrested, the NYPD routinely seized his or her personal property and recorded it in a computerized invoice system that tracked and categorized it. Once the criminal case against that individual was terminated, and the time to appeal had lapsed, the U.S. Constitution mandated that the government demonstrate a new legal basis to retain the property. But in practice, the NYPD often retained property and refused to release it until claimants obtained a \"DA Release,\" even where all charges had been dismissed and sealed. In the Bronx, the District Attorney's Office frequently failed to respond to requests for DA Releases, and the City did not provide an alternate recourse or assistance. The plaintiffs here alleged in the complaint that they tried numerous times - via voicemails, letters, and in-person requests - to obtain the property seized by the NYPD with no success. They subsequently filed this complaint against the city. The proposed class would consist of \"all individuals who have been or will be unable to secure the release from the NYPD Property Clerk of Personal Property seized in connection with an arrest where (i) the individual named on the voucher for the property can no longer be tried on any charge that was the original basis for the arrest, and (ii) the City has made no showing of any continued basis to retain the property.\"\n\nOn May 17, 2016, Judge Cote signed an order referring this case to a magistrate judge for settlement, and the settlement discussions were to take place in June. However, on June 3, 2016, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, which added two additional individual plaintiffs who experienced similar property loss by the NYPD and provided more facts as to the NYPD's process of returning property seized after an arrest. Five days later, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.\n\nOn July 25, 2016, the parties agreed to stay all proceedings through February 28, 2017 to work toward a possible settlement. Accordingly, on the same day, Judge Cote ordered that the plaintiffs' motion for class certification be denied without prejudice to renewal upon the expiration of the six-month stay. On March 1, 2017, the parties agreed to extend the stay, and at the parties’ consent, Judge Cote referred the case to Magistrate Judge James Francis for further settlement discussions.

The plaintiff sued the State of Colorado, the Colorado Department of Corrections, and the Warden of the Denver Women’s Correctional Facility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking damages. She claimed that defendants violated the ADA as well as her constitutional rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiff alleged she was denied a Sorenson Video Phone (SVP) after she placed multiple requests with the Department of Corrections to provide one so that she could communicate with her parents, who were deaf. The SVP offers a service for the deaf community paid for by the government for those who qualify under the ADA. Although the plaintiff originally struggled to meet the court’s pleading standards, once she obtained counsel from the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center on March 31, 2017, she filed a third amended complaint on June 15, 2017, adding three new plaintiffs. The new complaint also added claims under the Rehabilitation Act and replaced allegations of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations with claims of First Amendment violations. \n\nThe case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Gordon P. Gallagher and then later reassigned to Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak. On June 30, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, claiming that the plaintiff lacked standing to assert her claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act and that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n\nThe court disagreed with the defendants’ arguments and on September 29, 2017, denied the motion to dismiss. The court found that the plaintiff had standing to assert her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, that the plaintiff pleaded sufficiently plausible claims for relief. \n\nOn January 22, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint, adding two plaintiffs and removing the Fourteenth Amendment claim. The defendants filed an answer to this complaint on February 5, 2018. The plaintiffs dismissed an additional defendant on October 25, 2018 without explanation. Four days later, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that the Colorado Department of Corrections could not prove that the TTY phones it had were as effective as videophones and that CDOC provided no affirmative defenses under the Effective Communication Claim. In response, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on October 29, 2018, arguing in part that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies through the prison grievance system.\n\nThe plaintiffs joined their case with <i>Rabinkov v. Colorado Department of Corrections</i>, another federal case against the CDOC regarding the provision (or lack thereof) of videophones to deaf prisoners or relatives of deaf individuals on November 20, 2018. On December 27, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class of similarly-situated deaf prisoners; however, the motion was withdrawn less than a month later. \n\nOn January 14, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 17, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On January 25, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim for failure to state a claim; this was dismissed by Judge Varholak on April 9, 2019. Defendants then moved for summary judgment and for dismissal on mootness grounds on May 6, and June 21, respectively. \n\nOn September 18, 2019, Judge Varholak ruled on several outstanding motions: the defendants’ motion to dismiss, filed on June 21, 2019, one plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, filed on January 17, 2019, and the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, filed on May 6, 2019. Judge Varholak denied the June 21 motion (finding that the defendants had not met the burden to show that the plaintiffs’ claims were moot), granted the January 17 motion (one plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment on ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims), and granted in part and denied in part the May 6 motion (finding that two out of three plaintiffs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies but denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss regarding the remaining plaintiff’s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, First Amendment claims, and claims for compensatory damages). Finally, Judge Varholak ordered the Colorado Department of Corrections to make videophones available and to adopt effective and comprehensive policies relating to videophones. 2019 WL 4464036.\n\nOn October 4, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a joint motion for referral to a settlement conference, and Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter was assigned to conduct a settlement conference. The parties gave no reason for the sudden change in tactic. Currently, the conference is scheduled for October 28, 2019.

On April 24, the defendant issued an executive order permitting the activities that the plaintiffs alleged were unconstitutionally prohibited. The motion for preliminary injunction was dismissed as moot, however, the plaintiffs filed an amended motion on April 28. <hr>\n\nOn April 15, 2020, three Michigan residents, two owning cottages in the state and one owning a landscaping business, filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the Governor of the State of Michigan and three county prosecuting attorneys, in their official capacities, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Michigan state law. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Freedom Law Center, challenged Michigan's Executive Order 2020-42, which ordered all people in Michigan to stay home and suspended activities deemed unnecessary to sustain or protect life. The plaintiffs sought relief declaring that the enactment and enforcement of Executive Order 2020-42 violated \"their fundamental liberties and rights secured by the United States and Michigan Constitutions and an order enjoining the same.\" The plaintiffs also sought attorneys' fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Maloney.\n\nOn April 9, 2020, Executive Order 2020-42 was enacted in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan; as of April 8, Michigan reported 20,346 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 959 deaths from it. The order directed all Michigan residents to stay home, subject to exceptions for exercise and obtaining services or supplies, prohibited \"all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring among persons not part of a single household,\" and required that \"no person or entity shall operate a business or conduct operations that require workers to leave their homes or places of residence except to the extent that those workers are necessary to sustain or protect life or to conduct minimum basic operations.\" The order was put in place with the goal of suppressing the spread of COVID-19, preventing the state's health care system from being overwhelmed, and allowing time for the production of test kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. It was set to stay in effect until April 30, 2020. \n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, arguing it lacked any rational basis and deprived plaintiffs of their \"fundamental rights and freedom,\" such as the right to travel to their cottages, conduct landscaping business, and travel to purchase ammunition, \"yet the order provides exceptions for other activity and conduct that is similar in its impact and effects.\" Moreover, the plaintiffs asserted that the Executive Order violated their right to Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment, as it deprived plaintiffs of \"the use and enjoyment of their property without due process\" and because \"it broadly prohibits Plaintiffs . . . from traveling through public spaces and roadways to their cottages, and yet the executive order permits other travel with the same impact and effect of Plaintiffs’ forbidden travel.\" Furthermore, the plaintiffs asserted that the Executive Order violated their \"right to contract without government interference,\" their right to keep and bear arms, and their right to \"associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.\"\n\nOn April 20, the plaintiffs sought a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and asked for an order temporarily enjoining enforcement of Executive Order 2020-42 pending a hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should issue. \n\nOn April 24, 2020, the defendant issued Executive Order 2020-59, which permits: individuals to travel between their own residences and cottages within the State of Michigan, the operation of landscaping businesses within the State of Michigan, outdoor activities that include using boats with motors for recreational purposes, the sale of guns from any store via remote order and curbside pick-up, and the sale of guns in-store from stores that sell necessary supplies as well as guns in their normal course of business, and exempts from penalty religious gatherings at private residences. \n\nOn April 26, the plaintiffs stated that the requested relief is no longer necessary because the stipulation rendered the TRO and PI motion is moot. The next day, the court dismissed the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nOn April 28, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, claiming that while stipulation remedied the immediate harm, it did not resolve the constitutional issues presented. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 20, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims had become moot due to the series of executive orders that permitted the activities that the amended complaint alleged were prohibited.

The suit alleged that defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by forcibly returning plaintiffs to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (the “MPP”). Under the MPP, asylum seekers entering the United States from Mexico were returned to Mexico and waited outside the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings. The plaintiffs stated that MPP conflicted with CBP’s own procedure at the time that asylum seekers with “known physical or mental health issues” cannot be sent to Mexico. They alleged that DHS failed to put in place effective methods to ensure that people with known physical or mental health conditions were exempt from MPP and to identify and assess, for accommodations, immigrants with disabilities. The plaintiffs sought an order enjoining the defendants from continuing forcible removal of class members under MPP and requiring the defendants to put in place practices and procedures in compliance with Section 504.

The plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal on October 8, 2020. <hr>\n\nOn April 17, 2020, federal detainees at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (PCCF) filed this putative class action complaint at the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, addressing safety concerns posed by COVID-19. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and as an injunctive and declaratory action under 28 U.S.C. § 2201. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that conditions of confinement lacked reasonable preventative measures in response to the heightened health risks from COVID-19, in violation of their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. They pointed to ongoing failures by the defendant to comply with basic safety measures under the interim guidelines provided for correctional facilities by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including its social distancing requirement. The plaintiffs sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), declaratory and injunctive relief, and a writ of habeas corpus ordering immediate action to reduce the population at the PCCF and institute proper hygienic measures, with an independent monitor to ensure compliance. Concurrently, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that all federal detainees held or to be held by the PCCF be granted class certification. The case was assigned to Judge Leo T. Sorokin. \n\nOn April 20, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the consideration of the proposed class certification, or a two-week extension to file a response to the motion for class certification in the alternative. The court granted the motion on the same day. \n\nThe next day, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, as there were no cases of COVID-19 in PCCF in the detainee population as of April 20, and the petitioners did not have underlying medical conditions. A second motion was filed on April 24, further submitting that the requested remedies by the plaintiffs involved a challenge to the fact or duration of their confinement, outside of the writ of habeas. \n\nThe defendant submitted a status report confirming three cases of COVID-19 among employees on April 29.

Questions include housing arrangements of the proposed class, policies governing face masks, testing capacity in the PCCF, as well as the respondents’ response to the three confirmed cases of COVID-19.

The plaintiffs alleged that they applied for public benefits at New York City Job Centers, but were improperly denied those benefits in violation of state and federal law. They sought emergency injunctive relief and class certification. \n\nThe defendants denied the allegations and sought to disqualify plaintiffs' counsel from handling the case.

{"document": "This federal lawsuit, filed by the cities of Chelsea and Lawrence, Massachusetts, on Feb. 8, 2017, challenged President Trump’s Jan. 25, 2017 <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-30/pdf/2017-02102.pdf\">Executive Order 13768</a>, dealing with immigration enforcement, which threatened to withhold federal funds from \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" and take enforcement action against any locality that impedes the federal government's immigration law. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Boston Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the Executive Order violated the Tenth Amendment by coercing cities to choose between losing federal funding and losing control of their municipal self-governance. The Executive Order does not include a clear definition of what it means to be a \"sanctuary\" jurisdiction, apart from referencing 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that a local government entity cannot prohibit or restrict communication between government entities or officials and federal immigration authorities. The plaintiffs alleged their own compliance with § 1373, but complained first that § 1373 is unconstitutional, and second, that Executive Order threatened their funding without advance notice by unclearly extending beyond § 1373. The plaintiffs alleged that the U.S. had begun to designate certain cities as \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" and that Chelsea and Lawrence stood to be designated as such. In order to improve cooperation between immigrant residents and municipal police, Chelsea designated itself a \"sanctuary city\" and Lawrence took similar actions. The plaintiffs explained that they therefore feared being labeled \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" under the Executive Order and thus losing federal grants. As small cities with large working-class immigrant populations, the plaintiffs feared the implications of such a loss of key funding for their municipal budgets, including for public services that have nothing to do with immigration.\n\nThe complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked for a declaration that Chelsea and Lawrence comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, that § 1373 is an unconstitutional infringement on municipal and state self-government authority, and that the Executive Order violates the Tenth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. In addition, they claimed that the Executive Order violates the separation of powers by penalizing § 1373 violations without Congressional approval.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. \n\nOn Apr. 10, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The defendants argued that they have taken no action against the cities pursuant to the executive order and that the cities cannot show they have been injured by the existence of the EO. \n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on April 25, 2017, granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against operation of the Executive Order.  See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15608\">San Francisco v. Trump</a> for details. \n\nOn May 2, the plaintiffs moved to stay the proceedings in light of the nationwide preliminary injunction, and the court entered a stay on May 4.

The case was brought under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, with the Plaintiffs alleging that the Defendants had discriminated against them in many ways, including: denying them access to the full benefit of the University's programs, services, and activities; failing to provide for effective communication through the use of auxiliary aids and services; failing or refusing to provide timely accommodations; utilizing discriminatory policies, practices and procedures that tend to screen out students who are deaf; and failing to meet the ADA's mandate to provide services in the most integrated setting.  The students were represented by private counsel.\n\nFactual allegations included: that the University failed to provide accommodations for the use of American Sign Language, by providing unqualified or under-qualified interpreters -- the University allegedly justified this by claiming that it could not find qualified interpreters, but declined to hire such qualified interpreters when students presented them the opportunity; that the University's program for providing notes to deaf students was inadequate to the point that notes were often provided to students only long after the tests or exams for which they were relevant had already occurred; that students were sometimes required to attend classes where no interpreters were provided; that in some such classes the University's proposed solution was to have students make audio recordings of classes and them have them transcribed later, forcing students to sit through classes they could not understand or participate in, and then review transcripts during their free time. There were further examples of similar alleged violations. \n\nThe plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment an injunction requiring Utah State to adopt written policies and training programs to correct the alleged violations and to require them to provide appropriate auxiliary aids, services, and accommodations.

{"document": "On June 27, 2002, Barrier Busters (a disability advocacy group) and a class of disabled individuals filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the City of Erie, PA. The Plaintiffs alleged that the city of Erie had frequently failed to install mandatory curb cuts and to otherwise comply with the accessibility mandates of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 et seq., when it performed road and sidewalk construction and alterations since the ADA was passed in 1992.\n\nThe parties entered a court-approved Partial Consent Decree on March 18, 2003. On September 16, 2003, the parties entered a Second Partial Consent Decree and Partial Settlement; a third consent decree was entered on April 1, 2004, and a fourth on February 2, 2005. The Clearinghouse has not obtained these consent decrees, but it is clear from later documents that Erie made substantial commitments to both ensure adherence to the ADA curb cut requirements for new roads and future resurfacing projects, and to retrofit with curb cuts all areas where roads were built or resurfaced after the January 26, 1992 effective date of the ADA.  Erie committed to make annual reports showing where new road work had taken place and where new curb cuts were built. The consent agreements also recognized that Erie was not responsible for the non-compliance of state roads and highways in Erie that were resurfaced by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.\n\nIn 2006, a separate case was filed against PennDOT, addressing the issues of ADA compliance and curb cuts on state roads in Erie. See <i>Voices for Independence v. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</i> in related cases. The plaintiffs in <i>Voices for Independence</i> were represented by the same attorneys as the plaintiffs in this case.\n\nIn 2010, the Plaintiffs observed that the City of Erie's street resurfacing in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 should have triggered the construction of ADA-compliant curb cuts, but none were built, contrary to the earlier agreements. On September 27, 2011, the court entered a stipulated order under which Erie agreed to retrofit these sites with curb cuts and to pay Plaintiffs $31,000 in attorneys' fees and costs for the period from March 11, 2011, to August 26, 2011. This stipulated order did not abrogate the earlier Consent Agreements.\n\nNevertheless, Erie failed to install curb cuts. In an attempt to correct the problem, the parties agreed to a second stipulated order on August 31, 2012. The city promised to take remedial action to install these curb cuts and agreed to pay an unspecified amount to the plaintiffs for attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nOn April 18, 2013, the Third Stipulated Order was entered, which changed Erie's reporting obligations to the plaintiffs to make the process more efficient. Erie agreed to pay an unspecified amount to the Plaintiffs for attorneys' fees and costs. The Third Stipulated Order was amended on May 22, 2014, to mandate that construction work performed on or before August 5 must include curb ramps within the same construction season. The City also committed to use “best efforts” to complete 70% of curb ramps within the same calendar year for construction performed after August 5; plaintiffs agreed that, when necessary, construction could be delayed until June 30 of the next calendar year. \n\nOn March 11, 2015, plaintiffs moved to enforce the consent decrees. They alleged that the City violated the consent decrees for “an unspecified number of years” by installing fewer than six curb ramps at “T”-shaped intersections and fewer than eight curb ramps at “+”-shaped intersections. After discussions between the parties, Judge Baxter approved a fifth consent decree on May 27, 2015. The Fifth Consent Decree required the City to install 6 or 8 ramps, as appropriate, in all future construction. It also required the City to add ramps across the “leg” of the T in “T”-shaped intersections missing them at a rate of at least 75 ramps per year and included associated reporting requirements. \n\nThree years later, a new disagreement emerged about what kinds of intersections had to be retrofitted with curb ramps. Plaintiffs asserted that adding a thin layer of asphalt to a concrete intersection was an “alteration” under the ADA that required installation curb ramps. Erie disagreed. It argued that it is only required to add curb ramps when replacing old asphalt with new asphalt at asphalt intersections. On September 26, 2018, the court entered the Fourth Stipulated Order, which adopted plaintiffs’ view based on June, 2013 U.S. Department of Transportation guidelines. The Order required: <ul>\n<li>Installation of curb ramps at previously altered asphalt intersections at a rate of at least 125 ramps per year, estimated to finish by the end of 2024. \n<li> Installation of at least 125 curb ramps at previously altered concrete intersections by the end of 2025. \n</ul>\nHowever, the parties could not reach an agreement on whether there was a legal requirement to install curb ramps at concrete intersections altered prior to July, 2013. Erie preserved its right to litigate this issue in the Fourth Stipulated Order. \n\nAs of March 29, 2021, the consent decrees and stipulated orders remain in effect. The defendants continue to file annual status reports. The most recent status report was filed on February 2, 2021 and the case is ongoing. \n", "summary": "On January 27, 2002, Barrier Busters, a disability advocacy group, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the City of Erie, PA.

These instances of excessive force included police driving cars into protest leaders on June 28; using dangerous chokeholds and teargas on peaceful protesters on July 10; and using additional pepper spray, teargas, and chokeholds on protestors on August 22. The plaintiffs also alleged alleged that a curfew imposed by the defendants was only enforced against protesters.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that these actions violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly, and also violated their Fourth Amendment protection against excessive force, arrest without probable cause, and false imprisonment.

Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and ACLU of Virginia, the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, 52 U.S.C. § 10302 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  Specifically, they alleged that requiring absentee ballots to be marked in the presence of a witness was contrary to social distancing guidelines and that forcing voters to comply amid the COVID-19 pandemic unduly burdened the fundamental right to vote by forcing voters to choose between their safety and right to vote. Additionally, they alleged that the requirement disproportionately discriminated against elderly voters, African American voters, and voters with disabilities who face a heightened risk of illness from COVID-19. The case was assigned to Judge Norman K. Moon. \n\nOn April 21, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction that would: (1) prohibit the defendants from enforcing the witness requirement for the June 23 primary and all subsequent elections; (2) order the defendants to issue guidance instructing city and county election officials to count otherwise validly cast absentee ballots that are missing a witness signature for the June 23 primary election; (3) order the defendants to conduct a public campaign informing Virginia voters about the elimination of the requirement. \n\nOn April 23, a group of three individuals filed a motion to intervene as defendants. The next day, the Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) and another group of three voters also filed a motion to intervene.

{"document": "On November 17, 2011, several couples who reside in Alabama filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Alabama against the State of Alabama, alleging violations of the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.  The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and private counsel, sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees, alleging that the defendants' policies discriminated against non-U.S. citizens trying to obtain a marriage license in Alabama.  \n\nIn Alabama, no person may marry without a marriage license.  One of a probate judge's ministerial jobs is to issue marriage licenses to those couples that meet the requirements.  Alabama law states that the parties issuing the marriage license must obtain the Social Security Number of the individuals getting married and have it appear in the marriage license and certificate.  In 2008, the Alabama Attorney General, issued a statement saying that a Social Security Number or other proofs of citizenship were not required to obtain a marriage license.  The Attorney General ordered the probate offices to instead allow people trying to get married the opportunity to submit an affidavit saying they do not have a Social Security Number.  \n\nOn September 13, 2012, the District Court (Judge William Keith Watkins) denied Defendant Probate Judge McKinney, Jr.'s (Probate Judge Reed's predecessor) motion to dismiss.  The defendant argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing since they did not apply for a marriage license and thus did not suffer any type of injury.  However, the District Court (Judge Watkins) did not buy this argument since Judge McKinney, Jr. had a clear policy of requiring non-citizens who wanted to get a marriage license to provide proof of legal status.  The District Court (Judge Watkins) thus found that the plaintiffs were effectively barred from applying for a marriage license and that applying for it would have been futile.  On September 25, 2012, the District Court (Judge Watkins) denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification so on December 7, 2012, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint.  \n\nOn June 3, 2013, the District Court (Judge William Keith Watkins) entered a protective order assuring the confidentiality of certain information disclosed by both parties.  On June 11, 2013, the District Court (Judge Watkins) granted Defendant Probate Judge Reed's motion to dismiss any claims against him.  Judge Reed argued that his probate office did not require proof of citizenship prior to issuing marriage licenses, and that he was actually willing to give the plaintiffs their marriage licenses if they had applied for it.  Judge McKinney, Jr.'s prior policy was repealed and so the District Court (Judge Watkins) found that the plaintiffs no longer had standing.  \n\nOn August 19, 2013, the District Court (Judge William Keith Watkins) approved the parties' joint stipulation of dismissal.

{"document": "On March 15, 2011, a group of Hispanic farmers and ranchers brought suit against the United States and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, were potential claimants in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12757\">the proposed settlement agreement in <i>Garcia v. Vilsack</i></a>, an earlier case in which a group of Hispanic farmers and ranchers filed suit against the USDA, claiming that the USDA had systematically denied Hispanics farmers and ranchers loans and loan servicing in the 1990s.  In this case, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had violated their Fifth Amendment equal protection and due process rights by offering a settlement agreement unequal to the settlement agreement offered to <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12515\">African American</a>, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12657\">Native American</a>, and women farmers and ranchers who had previously sued the USDA over similar discrimination. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the proposed settlement agreement was unequal in comparison to the other discrimination settlements because it did not provide judicial supervision (leading to deficient notice and defective claims processes); did not provide assistance of class counsel; provided disproportionate monetary relief (only $1.33 billion, compared to the $2.23 billion in the African American discrimination case, despite Hispanic farmers outnumbering African American farmers 12 to 1); required additional proof elements in the claims process; and did not propose compensation for non-credit farm benefits. The plaintiff filed under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. They sought a declaration that this settlement proposal violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights and a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from engaging in racially discriminatory treatment of Hispanic farmers by treating them differently in comparison to African American, Native American, and women farmers with similar complaints.\n\nOn March 25, 2011, the plaintiffs filed papers for a putative class of plaintiffs in the <i>Garcia</i> case, who allegedly \"were subjected to, and continue to be subject to, USDA discrimination in its farm benefit programs\" and who \"are potential claimants\" under the defendants' administrative claim process for Hispanic farmers.\n\nOn May 11, 2011, the US moved to dismiss the case, denying any unlawful conduct and stating that the plaintiffs lacked standing, were attempting improper claim splitting, and were time barred. The plaintiffs moved to certify the class on June 11, 2011, and the defendant moved on June 14 to stay the certification motion pending adjudication of the motion to dismiss.  On November 11, 2011, Judge Reggie B. Walton entered an order asking parties to clarify whether the plaintiffs' claims were ripe, given that the settlement agreement in <i>Garcia</i> had not been formally proposed.  On December 21, 2011, Judge Walton entered an order denying all extant motions without prejudice, and holding the case in abeyance pending an announcement of the final version of Defendants' ADR program, because this suit would be unripe until the settlement agreement was formally proposed.\n\nOn January 20, 2012, the defendants in the <i>Garcia</i> case submitted the proposed framework for the settlement agreement. Based on the proposal, the plaintiffs in this case submitted a first amended complaint on April 13, 2012, and Judge Walton lifted the stay on the case on August 24, 2012. The defendant then moved to dismiss the amended complaint on September 24, 2012. On December 11, 2012, Judge Walton granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, ruling that there was no injury because participation in the administrative claims process was optional, and that the suit lacked redressability because the court had no way of compelling the government to propose a specific settlement agreement. 908 F. Supp. 2d 146.\n\nOn February 15, 2013, the plaintiffs entered a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (docket no. 13-05044). The Circuit court heard oral arguments from the parties more than a year later on May 7, 2014. In its opinion, the appellate court agreed that the plaintiffs' prayer for relief overreached because the court could not coerce a party, especially an Executive Branch agency, to settle in a case. Therefore, the district court correctly held that it lacked authority to enjoin the government to offer class settlement such as in previous cases. However, the appeals court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded the case on May 27, 2014 because the district court could have granted relief in the form of an injunction ordering the government not to act on unlawful racial grounds toward Hispanic and female farmers. \n\nWhile the parties litigated the case in district court on remand, the defendant filed a new motion on November 25, 2014 to dismiss on the grounds that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the complaint failed to state a valid claim. In response to the defendant's motion, the district court officially reopened the case on May 14, 2015.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the defendant filed a status report regarding the voluntary alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program established for farmers alleging discrimination against Hispanic and female individuals in making or servicing farm loans. The Claims Adjudicator approved a total of 3,210 claims in the ADR program. On October 23, 2015, USDA reported as a total of 2,847 of the approved claims had been paid by the Judgment Fund, and another 126 claims were in process.\n\nMonths later, Judge Walton granted the defendant's renewed motion to dismiss the case. When the defendant moved to dismiss in November 2014, Judge Walton found that in light of the appeals court's agreement that a court cannot order a party to settle, only the plaintiffs' equal protection claim remained. Judge Walton reasoned that the plaintiffs' other claims related to specific terms of the ADR and therefore the court did not have the authority to adjudicate those issues.\n\nIn relation to plaintiffs' equal protection claim, the defendant contended that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim because the complaint did not allege facts showing that the defendant had a discriminatory purpose in settling claims brought by hispanic or female farmers. Judge Walton agreed with the defendant and dismissed the case in March 2016, closing the case.", "summary": "On March 15, 2011, a group of Hispanic farmers and ranchers brought suit against the United States and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\") in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that they were being treated unequally compared to other minority and women farmers who have settled with the USDA regarding discriminatory lending practices. In December 2012, the District Court dismissed the case for lack of ripeness and redressability. The plaintiffs appealed the judgment on February 15, 2013 and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the lower court's decision and remanded the case for further proceedings on the grounds that while the court could not compel settlement, the district court could have issued an injunction ordering the defendant to not act on unlawful racial grounds. On remand, the defendant filed a status report in October 2015 regarding the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program established for the parties to work out settlement terms. While the ADR resulted in a vast majority of claims being paid, around 130 were processing. In addition, the defendant filed a renewed motion to dismiss the case in November 2015.

{"document": "This lawsuit, filed on July 21, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, was brought by the Western State Center (a public benefit corporation), the First Unitarian Church of Portland, a private individual, and two Oregon State Representatives. Represented by private attorneys, they sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Federal Protective Service, and the U.S. Marshal Service over the defendants' presence and role in quelling protests that ensued after the police killing of George Floyd in May of 2020.\n\nThe complaint alleged violation of the First and Tenth Amendments. The First Amendment claim was brought by First Unitarian Church and argued that the defendants' arrests of protesters were in violation of the First Amendment right to protest, but also in violation of the Free Exercise clause, as protest was an integral part of the church's philosophy. The Tenth Amendment claim, brought by all plaintiffs, claimed that the federal agencies' enforcement of law on Portland property (and not just federal property) amounted to an unconstitutional violation of the principles of federalism. Plaintiffs requested declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Michael W. Mosman and Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo.\n\nHowever, on July 27, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint. The amended complaint retained the arguments about free speech, free exercise, and principles of federalism, but added other claims regarding the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the federal agents were arresting Portland residents without probable cause, adding that some of these arrests were caught on video. Protesters were taken off the street by non-uniformed federal officers and hauled into unmarked vans. \n\nTwo days later the plaintiffs submitted a motion for a temporary restraining order with an expedited hearing and a motion for a preliminary injunction. However, on August 4 the court granted an email request to withdraw the motion for a temporary restraining order as moot. This is probably because the court had already granted a TRO against against federal agents in Portland in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17707&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseName%7CIndex%20Newspapers%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B><i>Index Newspapers</i></a> earlier in the week.

Judge Mosman granted the preliminary injunction with respect to the First Amendment claims, but denied the preliminary injunction with respect to the Tenth Amendment claim. 2020 WL 6555054. While Judge Mosman found no showing that the federal agents acted with retaliatory motive, he found that the President and Acting Secretary Chad Wolf expressed such a motivation and the plaintiffs were entitled to some form of injunctive relief. Under the preliminary injunction, Judge Mosman limited the defendants from engaging in crowd control beyond an extended city block around the U.S. Courthouse. \n\nThe defendants promptly appealed to the Ninth Circuit (docket no. 20-35959) and requested a stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied the defendants' emergency motion for a stay pending appeal without prejudice to renewal after the district court ruled on the motion to stay pending appeal. Then on November 9, 2020, the court held a status conference and vacated the order for the preliminary injunction as no longer necessary. The defendants subsequently dismissed the appeal.\n\nOn December 4, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing because the plaintiffs did not attend the protest and the feared injuries were not injuries in fact or traceable to federal agents' conduct. In addition, they argued that the First Amendment allegations were actually weaker than what was considered in the preliminary injunction motion. The defendants also requested a stay of discovery.\n\nThe parties then consented to proceed before Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo.

{"document": "On September 25, 2019, the State of New York and the Kings County District Attorney filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs challenged the federal government’s new directive authorizing civil immigration arrests in and around New York State courthouses (“the Directive”). The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the Directive violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Tenth Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Jed S. Rakoff. \n\nIn their complaint, the plaintiffs stated that prior to a January 2018 ICE directive addressing “Civil Immigration Enforcement Actions Inside Courthouses,” there was a longstanding practice of avoiding civil immigration arrests in and around state courthouses. And, because New York recognizes a common-law privilege against civil arrests in, or while traveling to or from, courthouses, the plaintiffs argued that the Directive, which generally authorizes such arrests, violates the APA by exceeding ICE’s statutory authority. The plaintiffs also claimed that the Directive is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA because it was issued absent adequate justification or explanation. \n\nNext, the plaintiffs alleged that implementation of the Directive disrupts the effective functioning of the State’s court system, deters victims and witnesses from assisting law enforcement and vindicating their rights, hinders criminal prosecution, and undermines public safety. The plaintiffs also noted that ICE enforcement actions at New York State courthouses had “skyrocketed” since the Directive was issued, and that such enforcement had significantly chilled participation in the courts. Thus, the plaintiffs argued that the Directive violates the Tenth Amendment by impermissibly interfering with New York’s right to form its own government by disrupting state court operations and impeding criminal prosecutions. \n\nOn October 23, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The defendants claimed that the Directive is unreviewable under the APA, there is no federal common-law immunity from immigration enforcement for those who are subject to ICE arrest, and that the Directive does not implicate the Tenth Amendment because it does not command or compel state actors to take any action.\n\nOn December 19, 2019, the district court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss with respect to all of the plaintiffs’ claims for relief. First, Judge Rakoff found that the Directive was final agency action subject to judicial review. Next, he held that the common-law privilege against civil courthouse arrests applies to immigration arrests, and has not been displaced by federal immigration law. Finally, he found that the facts presented demonstrate that ICE has commandeered state and local judges and court officials not to take action in response to ICE courthouse arrests, even when such arrests cause great disruption and state agents would therefore normally intervene. 431 F.Supp.3d 377.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on March 13, 2020. The motion was accompanied by three amicus briefs: one from former nominee to be U.S. Attorney General for Civil Rights and Commissioner of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Debo Adegbile, another from Harvard Law Professor Nikolas Bowie, and a third from the New York Bar Association.\n\nJudge Rakoff granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on June 10, 2020. He held that the Immigration and Nationality Act incorporated the English common law rule preventing service and arrest on people in or traveling to a courthouse. He also ruled that the policy change violated the APA's arbitrary and capricious review standard. He was not persuaded by the defendants' arguments that executive orders and policy directives from DHS effectively mandated that arrests must be carried out in courthouses because the orders mandated no such thing. In granting the summary judgment motion, Judge Rakoff also granted the motion for declaratory and injunctive relief and enjoined ICE from carrying out any civil arrests in New York courthouses. 2020 WL 3067715.\n\nOn August 7, 2020, the defendants appealed to the Second Circuit.

{"document": "On January 13, 2012, the Prison Legal News (PLN) filed a civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for Oregon under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Columbia County. The plaintiff, represented by Human Rights Defense Center and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, claiming that the defendants' \"postcard only\" and \"no magazine\" policies for inmate mail violated the plaintiff's First Amendment rights, as well as the First Amendment rights of inmates at the Jail and their correspondents. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the policy resulted in the unlawful censorship of PLN's books and magazines, which are sent to individual subscribers in custody at the Columbia County Jail. The plaintiff claimed that these mailings were protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiff also alleged the defendants' \"notice and appeal\" policy for rejected inmate mail violated the plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights and the procedural due process rights of inmates and their correspondents.\n\nOn May 29, 2012, Judge Michael H. Simon granted the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction in part, holding that the jail's policy likely violated the First Amendment. Judge Simon ordered the defendants to stop restricting all incoming and outgoing inmate personal mail to postcards only and to stop refusing to deliver or process inmate mail solely on the grounds that it is not on a postcard. Prison Legal News v. Columbia Cnty., 2012 WL 1936108 (D. Or. May 29, 2012). Judge Simon rejected the jail's arguments that the policy was rationally related to both safety and the efficient use of the jail's limited resources. \n\nOn September 13, 2012, PLN moved for partial summary judgment on the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief and on the defendants' affirmative defense of failure to mitigate damages. These issues went to two separate trials in 2013: a bench trial and a jury trial. \n\nFrom February 5 to February 8 the parties argued before Judge Simon in the bench trial. The defendants argued that the rationale behind the policy was preventing the introduction of contraband and saving time during mail inspection. Following the trial, Judge Simon found that this rationale was not supported by the evidence. This was the first time a postcard-only policy went to trial, so it is the first available legal precedent that can be used in future litigation against postcard-only policies. \n\nOn February 8, after the bench trial, Judge Simon asked the parties to submit post-trial briefing on several issues relating to the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief, including: the legal criteria for a permanent injunction; the application of the trial evidence to the legal standard; whether the Sheriff's credibility and limited political term impact the Court's analysis; and whether the injunction should be permanent or a limited term. \n\nOn April 24, 2013, Judge Simon held that the jail's policy was unconstitutional. Judge Simon issued a Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and entered the Final Judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against all defendants on May 28, 2013. Judge Simon permanently enjoined the defendants from restricting incoming and outgoing inmate personal mail to postcards only. Judge Simon also declared that inmates have a First Amendment right to receive magazines, and publishers have a First Amendment right to send magazines to inmates and have their magazines delivered. As such, the defendants' policy and custom of prohibiting magazines violated the First Amendment. Judge Simon also declared that that inmates and their unincarcerated correspondents have a Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process when the defendants reject their mail and that the defendants must notify an inmate and the unincarcerated correspondent when the defendants reject correspondence written by or addressed to the inmate, including a description of the rejected mail and the basis for the rejection.

Subsequently, the plaintiffs moved to recover attorney fees and costs. \n\nOn June 25, 2013, the defendants moved for the court to amend its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, as well as for relief from the judgment. They claimed that the plaintiffs lacked standing for the claims, that the claims were moot based off of corrective actions taken, and that the postcard policy is not a violation of the First Amendment. They sought to have the declaratory judgment removed and claimed that the preliminary injunction should be found an unnecessary remedy by the court. On July 31, 2013, the court denied the motions and the findings and conclusions were left in place. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit in August 2013. While the appeal was pending, the court sent the parties to mediation.\n\nOn March 24, 2014, Judge Simon in the district court granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part, awarding the plaintiff a total of $802,176.46 in attorney fees and expenses. 2014 WL 1225100 (D. Or. 2014). The appellate court then stayed its proceedings in order to give the defendants time to appeal the attorney fees decision.\n\nThe defendants filed the second appeal in April 2014 and in June 2014, the appeals were consolidated. However, the defendants subsequently moved, unopposed, to dismiss the appeal. The parties may have engaged in settlement talks, but it is unclear why the defendants sought voluntary dismissal.

{"document": "On January 15, 2015, the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center (CREEC), along with two individuals requiring wheelchairs for mobility, brought this class action against Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc., in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Ashford operated 15 hotels in California and others throughout the United States. In October 2014, the two plaintiffs had separately asked if the Courtyard Oakland Airport hotel and the Embassy Suites Walnut Creek hotel provided wheelchair-accessible shuttle services. Both locations informed the plaintiffs that they did not. The plaintiffs alleged that Ashford violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act by failing to provide wheelchair accessible vehicles at its hotels. The plaintiffs requested declaratory relief and a permanent injunction requiring Ashford to comply with state statutes and the ADA. The plaintiffs filed for class certification of individuals who rely on wheelchairs or scooters for mobility and have been or would be denied full and equal enjoyment of Ashford's services because of the lack of accessible transportation services at Ashford's hotels. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Donna M. Ryu. \n\nOn March 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed to consolidate and/or relate this case to two other cases for pre-trial purposes, because the defendants were publicly traded real estate investment trusts that own and operate hotels in the U.S. and the plaintiff was similarly-situated and seeking class certification. The judge rejected the argument that these similarities warranted case consolidation, and denied this motion on May 6, 2015. \n\nOn August 27, CREEC filed a stipulated dismissal of all claims, with prejudice, of one of the plaintiffs. In an amended complaint filed on August 31, that plaintiff was removed and a new one was added.\n\nMeanwhile the court had granted the defendant's request for private alternative dispute resolution and the parties began settlement discussions before Magistrate Judge James Larson. These proceedings concluded with a settlement agreement reached on October 2, 2015.

The judge granted both motions on December 18, 2015. \n\nThe Settlement Agreement required all Ashford-owned and operated hotels to come into compliance with ADA regulations by providing hotels that offer transportation services with equivalent transportation services for people who used wheelchairs or scooters.

{"document": "This is a case about the unfair business practices of Global Tel*Link, a private company with a state granted monopoly on telephone services in New Jersey's prison systems. On August 20, 2013 the plaintiffs, people incarcerated in New Jersey prisons and people who created accounts with Global Tel*Link to receive calls from New Jersey prisoners, filed this class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it was assigned to United States District Judge William J. Martini. The plaintiffs sued Global Tel*Link and several associated companies, alleging violations of New Jersey's Consumer Fraud and Public Utilities statutes, the Federal Communications Act (42 U.S.C. § 201), the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201). They plaintiffs also brought a common law unjust enrichment claim. In their § 1983 count, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants, acting on behalf of the State of New Jersey, imposed unconscionable fees and rates on plaintiffs, which amounted to a  violation of the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on the taking of property without just compensation. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages, disgorgment, restitution, and prejudgment interest, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. Specifically, they claimed that the defendant's billing policies were \"abusive, discriminatory, and unreasonable.\" \n\nIn 2006, Global Tel*Link, an Alabama company that provides telecommunications services and surveillance technology to correctional institutions, bought the contractual right to be the sole provider of telecommunications for prisons and many county jails in New Jersey. The plaintiffs in this case alleged that Global Tel*Link abused its monopoly power by charging plaintiffs exorbitant rates, forcing friends and family of incarcerated people to create prepaid accounts with minimum payments of $25 to receive calls from their loved ones, forfeiting money from prepaid accounts when they went unused for 90 days, and failing to disclose rates, fees, and billing practices. The defendants paid commissions, sometimes exceeding 50% of their revenue, to the correctional agency they contracted with. To turn a profit the defendants charged exceedingly high rates for calls and imposed numerous fees, such a 19% fee on deposits to the prepaid accounts.\n\nOn November 22, 2013, the defendants moved to dismiss the case, arguing that it should have been brought as a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) instead. At that time, the FCC had been in the process of determining whether the defendants' business practices were violations of the Federal Communications Act, as alleged in this lawsuit. On September 8, 2014, the court issued an opinion denying the motion to dismiss, but staying the case until the conclusion of the FCC's proceedings. The plaintiffs responded on September 19, 2014 by withdrawing their Federal Communications Act claim, as well as their claim under New Jersey Public Utilities Statutes.\n\nAfter close to a year of discovery disputes, on August 7, 2015, the defendants moved to compel arbitration based on arbitration clauses in their products' terms of use. On February 11, 2016, Judge Martini denied the motion with respect to all but one of the plaintiffs. He found that the recorded message notifying Global Tel*Link users of its terms of use, including the arbitration provision, did not inform most of the plaintiffs that they would have to abide by Global Tel*link's terms of use to use its services. Consequently, the court held the plaintiffs did not enter into a legally enforceable contract with the defendants. One of the named plaintiffs who created their account through the defendants' website, which used a different system, was forced to arbitrate their claim. \n\nOn June 15, 2016, the defendants filed a motion with the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate this case with several others on which prisoners and their families were suing Global Tel*Link. The Panel denied that request in an October 13, 2015 order, docketed as JPML No. 2651, Entry 23.\n\nThe defendants appealed Judge Martini's arbitration decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on March 9, 2016. On March 29, 2017, the Third Circuit affirmed Judge Martini's ruling in an opinion by Judge Thomas M. Hardiman. James v. Global Tel*Link Corp. 852 F.3d 262 (3d Cir. 2017). The Circuit agreed with Judge Martini that because the plaintiffs did not receive the defendants' terms of use or were informed that use of the defendants' services constituted assent to the terms, the plaintiffs were not bound by them or the arbitration clause they contained. \n\nWhile the appeal was pending, the case lay mostly dormant in the district court. The litigation continued to move slowly until the plaintiffs moved for class certification on their New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and § 1983 Fifth Amendment Takings Clause claims on February 27, 2018. On August 6, 2018, Judge Martini granted that motion and certified a class consisting of all people incarcerated in New Jersey prisons or correctional institutions who used a phone system provided by the defendants and people who received calls from a person incarcerated in New Jersey or established an advance pay account to receive calls from such a person from 2006 to June 2011 (with the exception of people calling from or to Essex County).\n\nOn March 27, 2018 the defendants moved for summary judgment and on May 4, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion on their § 1983 Takings claim. Judge Martini denied both motions on August 6 in a separate opinion from the one addressing the class certification question.The court rejected several of the defendants' legal claims, including the assertion that they were not state actors amenable to suit under § 1983 and finding issues of material fact for others. \n\nOn April 2, 2018, Judge Martini referred the case to mediation and took the step of scheduling a settlement conference on December 10, 2019. However, the parties were unable to reach an agreement and the case was scheduled for trial in March of 2020.\n\nOn January 24, 2020, the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings and to decertify the plaintiffs' class. Judge Martini granted the defendants' motion and dismissed plaintiffs' Fifth Amendments Takings claims on March 2, 2020. He found that denying the plaintiffs reasonably priced calling options did not amount to a taking as it lacked legal compulsion. The court did not resolve the decertification motion.\n\nThis case was scheduled to go to trial on March 16, 2020. However, in a March 3 settlement conference the parties reached an agreement on the broad terms of a settlement and the trial was canceled. After more negotiation, the plaintiffs moved for preliminary approval of a proposed settlement on May 28, 2020, which Judge Martini granted on July 15, 2020.\n\nThe settlement provided that the defendants would pay $25 million to a settlement fund. That money would be distributed to members of the plaintiffs' class based on the amount each member spent on the defendants' services, with a maximum recovery of $5,000 per account. While the class certified by the court included people who used the defendants' services in New Jersey after 2006, the settlement only allowed for payment to class members who used the defendants' services from 2006 to 2016. The settlement also allowed the plaintiffs to apply for a maximum of $8,332,500 in attorneys' fees. It also provided that class members who were still incarcerated in New Jersey would receive their payments in the form of credits on the phone accounts without filing a proof of claim. However, the settlement did not enjoin the defendants from continuing to engage in unfair business practices, as the plaintiffs had requested in their complaint.\n\nAfter the proposed settlement was filed, on September 21, 2020, several plaintiffs from a separate class action against the defendants in the Northern District of Georgia moved to intervene in this case. The plaintiffs in the Georgia case also challenged some of the defendants' business practices, but on behalf of a putative class of individuals across the country who used the defendants' services. On October 22, 2020, Judge Martini denied this motion, finding that the Georgia plaintiffs did not have a sufficient direct interest in this case to intervene, but allowing them to appear as amicus curiae at the fairness hearing.\n\nThat hearing happened on October 15, 2020 and a week on October 22, 2020 later Judge Martini issued an opinion approving the settlement. He found that the settlement met all the relevant tests for approval and that he could not address the Georgia plaintiffs' concerns about the settlement, as their class had not yet been certified.\n\nThe case was closed the day of the order approving the settlement, though the settlement provides that the court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement and its enforcement. The is case ongoing as of November 2020 for settlement enforcement purposes.

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, requested injunctive relief and monetary damages, alleging that the City unlawfully targeted citizens on the basis of race, violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiff claimed that officers of the police department had issued warrants based on intentionally false or misleading information, subjecting him to unreasonable search and seizure, arresting him without probable cause, and maliciously prosecuting him.  On October 6, 2008, the charges against the plaintiff were dismissed when the Alameda County District Attorney's Office discovered that the warrant had been illegally obtained.

The plaintiffs asked the court to issue a writ of habeas corpus, or in the alternative, issue injunctive relief ordering the immediate release of the plaintiffs. In addition, the plaintiffs sought a declaration stating that the continued detention of individuals at increased risk for severe illness including COVID-19, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Further, the plaintiffs asked for an award of attorneys' fees. \n\nThe complaint alleged that the medical conditions or underlying diseases of these detained individuals, like diabetes and hypertension, made them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. The facilities where ICE has detained the plaintiffs lacked access to critical care necessary for treating serious cases of COVID-19.\n\nAccording to the complaint, imprisoned populations, including those in ICE detention facilities, pose a higher risk for the spread of infectious disease. The plaintiffs stated that in March 2020, over 3,000 medical professionals across the United States urged ICE to release individuals and families to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among detainees as well as facility staff. The complaint also explained that social distancing measures and large-scale quarantines as recommended by the Center for Disease Control are \"nearly impossible\" in immigration detention due to overcrowding, poor availability of hygiene products, and lack of access to adequate medical services.\n\nIn addition to the complaint, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order as well as an emergency writ of habeas corpus and requested an immediate hearing given the time-sensitive nature of the case.

{"document": "On May 12, 2005, male arrestees at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs sued the warden of Central Booking, the Baltimore Police Department, the City of Baltimore, and other state officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the Court for injunctive relief, compensatory and consequential damages, and attorneys fees and costs. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they engaged in unconstitutional strip searches of the plaintiffs and detained the plaintiffs for unreasonable lengths of time. This case was one of three cases alleging mistreatment of persons arrested and taken to Central Booking for booking and processing. The other cases were JC-MD-0008: Maryland NAACP v. Baltimore City Police Department, 1:06-cv-01863-CCB (D. Md. 2006) and JC-MD-0011: Rodney v. Murphy, 24-C-05004405, filed in Maryland state court. \n\nPlaintiffs sought certification for five classes. First, the suspicionless strip search class which consisted of those who had been or would be arrested for crimes not involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, who were strip searched by Central Booking employees without any individualized finding that they were harboring weapons, drugs, or other contraband. Second, the non-private strip search class was composed of those who had been or would be subjected to strip searches at Central Booking with other arrestees present. Third, the equal protection strip search class consisted of male arrestees strip searched at Central Booking while similarly-situated female arrestees were not. Fourth, the underwear strip search class was made up of male arrestees subjected to an underwear strip search while similarly-situated female arrestees were not. Fifth, the over-detention class consisted of those arrested without warrants who had been or would be detained for an unreasonable length of time (more than 48 hours) before presentment to a judicial officer for a determination of probable cause. \n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim. The District Court (District Judge Catherine C. Blake) granted the motion in part and dismissed all claims against the City and the Police Department, rejecting the theory of \"entrustment liability.\"  Claims against the state defendants survived, with the exception of individual claims against the current warden. 470 F.Supp.2d 537 (D. Md. Jan 04, 2007). \n\nOn July 11, 2008, the district court (Judge Blake) issued a memorandum on the issue of whether the gender-differentiated search policy violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the issue and denied the defendants' motion.\n\nOn March 19, 2009, the district court partially granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify a class.  Specifically, the court certified the following subclasses: 1) those people detained for more than 48 hours without having been brought before a commissioner, and 2) those people arrested for minor, nondrug, nonviolent offenses and strip-searched before they were brought before a commissioner. The court declined to certify the following subclasses: 1) those people who weren't strip-searched privately, and 2) male arrestees who were searched to their underwear when female detainees were not.\n\nFor the next two years, discovery motions were exchanged, until the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 14, 2011. \n\nOn March 5th, 2013 Judge Blake issued a memorandum and an order granting the motion for partial summary judgment. The court granted the motion under the doctrine of qualified immunity. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed an appeal on August of 2013.  A panel of three judges rendered a decision on November 11, 2014. 771 F.3d 209 (4th Cir. 2014). The Circuit Court (Circuit Judge James Harvie Wilkinson III) affirmed the district court's decision to grant partial summary judgment for the defendants. The court noted that several police officers and guards testified that they found illegal contraband from these searches. And the searchers were being conducted in a private room. On the issue of qualified immunity, the court noted that the right to not be subjected to a strip search was not clearly established at the time of the searches. A Supreme Court decision was filed in 2012, settling aspects of the issue after the fact, but before this, officers who were conducting searches, could not reasonably tell if the searches were violating a constitutional right. The court found the defense of qualified immunity acceptable here, and determined that the motion for partial summary judgment was properly granted. \n\nCircuit Judge James Andrew Wynn Jr. filed a concurring opinion in which he pointed out that the Supreme Court intimated in the <i>Florence</i> decision that there may be exceptions to the rule. That detainees not being admitted into the general population should not have to be stripped searched. The complexities of the exceptions had not been explored by the courts, and Judge Wynn noted that there needed to be more elaboration on this topic, so public officials would know how to act accordingly. However, the merits of the case were not be reached because of the granting of summary judgment. \n\nOn February 24, 2015 Judge Blake filed a memo regarding the January 31, 2011 motion for partial summary judgment. 2015 WL 790334. The motion was made by the warden-defendant, over the class of Plaintiffs claiming that Central Booking practiced \"over-detention.\"  The court held that the plaintiffs' theory of supervisor liability was defective because there was no evidence that the warden-defendant was deliberately indifferent to the constitutional injury of the Plaintiffs. The warden-defendant did not deny that there were detainees held longer than 48 hours, which was past what was constitutionally acceptable, but she argued that it was caused by factors outside of her control. The court agreed that the delays in presenting detainees before a court commissioner was the fault of the Baltimore police, the state's attorneys office, and court officials. Furthermore, the court argued that the warden had made several efforts to remedy the problem, and that the plaintiffs' complaint that it was not fast enough or proactive enough did not prove deliberate indifference. Finally, the court also granted the summary judgment motion on the theory of qualified immunity, so the defendant had no fair warning that her conduct was unconstitutional. \n\nA few months later on June 15, 2015 the Court entered final judgment and closed the case. \n", "summary": "This class action lawsuit was filed on May 12, 2005 by two male arrestees in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.

{"document": "On August 14, 2018, two children with mental health disabilities in the District of Columbia and University Legal Services, Inc. filed this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and a class of children with mental health disabilities, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the District of Columbia under:<ul><li>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 <i>et seq.</i>;</li><li>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;</li><li>The Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights program, 29 U.S.C. § 794;</li><li>Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid Act), 42 U.S.C. § 1396; and</li><li>42 U.S.C. § 1983.</li></ul>The plaintiffs, represented by the National Center for Youth Law, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in-house counsel, and private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief together with costs and attorney’s fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the District of Columbia failed to comply with mandates of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Medicaid Act. Specifically, they claimed that the District of Columbia failed to provide medically necessary intensive community-based services (ICBS) to children with mental health disabilities.\n\nIntensive community-based services consist of three components:\n<ol><li><i>Intensive care coordination</i> (ICC): designing and supervising a plan to provide and coordinate services to children that includes the child, the child’s family, and service providers;</li><li><i>Intensive behavior support services</i>: individual therapy provided to the child where they live; and</li><li><i>Mobile crisis services</i>: crisis response services that can provide care in a child’s home, school, or community.</li></ol>In their complaint, the plaintiffs acknowledged that the District of Columbia provides some components of ICBS. For example, the District offers the “high fidelity wraparound” ICC program, “community-based intervention” services, and the Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) intensive support program. But the plaintiffs alleged that the District’s existing services “fail[] to provide medically necessary ICBS” for many children who need them. \n\nThe complaint did not name the putative class representatives. Instead, the plaintiffs moved that the minor plaintiffs be allowed to proceed anonymously. Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell granted this motion on August 14, 2018. Judge Howell determined that the plaintiffs have a “strong interest” in protecting “highly sensitive details” about their mental health that would be revealed in the litigation that outweighs the government defendants’ “minimal” interest in disclosure.  \n\nThe District moved to dismiss the case on October 3. First, it argued that the two individual plaintiffs lack standing. The District claimed that the first individual plaintiff refused to use the District’s existing wraparound services, that the second would not be eligible for ICBS because she is in the custody of the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, and that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a claim by University Legal Services alone. Second, it argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because the plaintiffs’ allegations involve the adequacy of care rather than where the District provides services. Finally, the District argued that the plaintiffs’ allegations that it violated Medicaid requirements were “threadbare . . . conclusory statements” that could not support a claim under the pleading standard set in <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i>. \n\nOn July 25, 2019, the court (now Judge Emmet G. Sullivan) denied the motion to dismiss holding that the individual plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit, had sufficiently stated a claim under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and had sufficiently alleged a § 1983 claim. 401 F.Supp.3d 1.\n\nAs of July 2020, discovery is ongoing.\n", "summary": "On August 14, 2018, two children with mental health disabilities and University Legal Services, Inc. filed this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and a class of children with mental health disabilities in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the state ban against same-sex marriage violated their rights under the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, the First Amendment (right to associate), and violated the Supremacy Clause and the Establishment Clause. This case was captioned as <i>Brenner v. Scott</i>. \n\nOn March 12, 2014, several same-sex couples married outside of the state of Florida, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, filed essentially an identical lawsuit, also in the Northern District of Florida.

Hodges</a>, that the right to marry was fundamental. In the opinion written by Justice Kennedy, the Court held that it demeans gay and lesbian couples to deprive them of access to marriage. The Fourteenth Amendment thus did not allow states to ban same-sex marriage. Kennedy was joined without further writing by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor. Each of the four dissenters—Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito—wrote a dissent. \n\nOn August 4, 2015, the <i>Grimsley</i> plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. The defendants opposed, arguing that the court should not grant summary judgment but rather dismiss the case as moot.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendants moved for voluntarily dismissal of the appeal at the Eleventh Circuit.

{"document": "On April 14, 2019, several pre-trial detainees in Wayne County Jail filed this class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the 36th District Court in Detroit, the Wayne County Sheriff's Office (WCSO), the Chief Judge, and five Magistrates of the 26th District Court in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the Sixth Amendment's Right to Counsel. The case was assigned to Judge Laurie J. Michelson. \n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the defendants unconstitutionally detained them in Wayne County Jail because they were unable to pay for their release and that the defendants' current arraignment policies created a wealth-based detention system that kept the plaintiffs in jail for their inability to afford bail. All of the plaintiffs included in the complaints were arrested and had their arraignment hearings held in the 36th District Court in Detroit. The plaintiffs were not provided attorneys during their arraignments and in each instance, the plaintiffs were ordered to pay cash bail amounts beyond their financial abilities. The arraignment policies provided two different condition forms: (1) 10% bail condition, which required the plaintiff to pay 10% or the real estate equivalent of their bail amount in order to be released; or (2) full cash bail condition, which required the plaintiff to pay the full amount. The magistrate judges that set the plaintiffs' bail amounts did not inquire whether the plaintiffs could afford their set bail amounts. When plaintiffs notified the court that they were unable to pay bail, they were sent to Wayne County Jail. \n\nThe plaintiffs also sought class certification of all pre-trial detainees that had their bail set during arraignment hearings held in the 36th District Court and as a result of the court's bail policies were detained because they could not afford their imposed cash bail conditions. \n\nOn June 10, 2019, WCSO moved to dismiss the complaint. They alleged that the plaintiffs could not seek injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because: they were an entity entitled to quasi-judicial immunity where declaratory relief was available; under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for municipal liability because obeying court orders is not considered a policy of the municipality; and the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that clearly established law would have put WCSO on notice that obeying a court order for pretrial incarceration would expose it to liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n\nOn June 19, 2019, the Chief Judge moved to dismiss plaintiffs' class action complaint.\n\nA stipulated stay order was entered on August 23, 2019 to allow time for discussions between the parties as to resolution of the matter.

{"document": "This is one of several federal lawsuits addressing North Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (HB2), which was passed on March 23, 2016.  For the others, see the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?saveRef=pl&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BspecialCollection%7C43%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B\">case collection.</a>\n\nOn February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed Ordinance 7056, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in public accommodations, passenger vehicle for hire, and city contractors. The city ordinance was set to take effect on April 1, 2016.\n\nIn response, on March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature held a special session and passed House Bill 2; it was signed that same day by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. HB2 prohibited municipalities in North Carolina from enacting anti-discrimination policies and removed the statutory and common-law private right of action to enforce state anti-discrimination statutes in state courts. It also required that individuals only be permitted to use bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates while in government buildings.  For many transgender people, this prevented them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity (in North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery can change the sex on their birth certificates; some other jurisdictions have even more restrictive rules).  In addition, the legislation changed the definition of sex in the state's anti-discrimination law to \"the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate,” which prevented discrimination against transgender people from being classified as a type of sex discrimination. \n\nOn May 4, in a letter to Governor Pat McCrory, the Justice Department informed him that the U.S. had concluded that HB2 violated federal law.  The DOJ <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/north-carolina-hb2/481347/\">asked</a> the Governor to respond by close of business on May 9, and that he remedy the violations, \"including by confirming that the State will not comply with or implement H.B. 2.\"\n\nInstead of providing the demanded assurances, the Governor sued the United States on the morning of May 9, in the Eastern District of North Carolina, seeking a declaratory judgment that HB2 did not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq.), or the Violence Against Woman Act (42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)).  That case is in the Clearinghouse as <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15316\">PA-NC-0003</a>, and is described there. A few hours later, the U.S. filed this lawsuit, seeking to enjoin operation of HB2, in the U.S District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The DOJ sued the State of North Carolina under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq.), under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.), and under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)). The DOJ sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the U.S. asked the Court to find that HB 2’s Part I—the part that instructs public agencies to deny transgender individuals access to multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities consistent with their gender identity--violated federal law, and to issue an injunction ordering the state to stop violating the federal laws in question.\n\nNorth Carolina’s former Attorney General, Roy Cooper, had <a href=\" http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article68780957.html\">said</a> that he agreed that HB2 is illegal, and declined to defend it against this and the other lawsuits challenging it.\n\nOn June 10, 2016 the United States and the Defendants issued a joint motion to enjoin automatic suspension of funds received under the Violence Against Women Act that prohibits recipients of federal funds administered by the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women (“OVW”) from engaging in discrimination based on sex and gender identity. The United States and the Defendants agreed that the suspension of funds would on balance harm the public interest. On June 23, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder granted the parties' joint motion to enjoin the United States from automatically withholding funds. 192 F.Supp.3d 620. \n\nOn June 29, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder granted Phil Berger, President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate, and Tim Moore, Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, the right to permissively intervene as defendants in the case. Several other private individuals requested to intervene on either side of the case and their motions were denied. \n\nOn July 14, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder ordered that parties in the four related cases of HB2 file a short joint notice identifying any agreements reached and explaining their respective positions. On July 25, 2016, the Court consolidated this case with <i>Carcaño v. McCrory</i>(1:16CV236), <i>Berger v. United States</i> (1:16CV844), and <i>North Carolinians for Privacy v. United States</i> (1:16CV845) for discovery purposes only. After this consolidation, the Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed <i>Berger v. United States</i> on July 28, 2016, and <i>North Carolinians for Privacy v. United States</i> on August 31, 2016.\n\nOn August 12, 2016, the Defendants submitted motions to stay the proceedings in light of the Supreme Court hearing the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14977\">G.G.</a> case regarding similar issues. Ten days later, the United States submitted a response in opposition to the Defendants' request to stay the proceedings. The United States stated that the Defendants were violating federal laws and that the proceedings should not be delayed in anticipation of a change in the law. \n\nOn December 16, 2016, upon the joint motion of the parties and in the interest of judicial economy, the court stayed the proceedings in the case and in the related case of <i>Carcano v. McCrory</i> (1:16CV236) pending disposition in the Supreme Court of Gloucester County School Board v. G.G., No. 16- 273 (S. Ct.).

On February 22, 2017, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, under President Trump, withdrew and rescinded their earlier guidance documents, changing the federal government’s position.

No outcome yet. <hr>\n \nOn May 11, 2020, the Texas State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Texas Alliance for Retired Americans, and six individuals filed this lawsuit against the Texas Secretary of State, challenging the constitutionality of the laws restricting vote by mail. The plaintiffs brought this lawsuit as a declaratory action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, and as an injunctive action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the current vote by mail system was in violation of the plaintiffs' First, Fourteenth, and Twenty-Fourth Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the requirement that voters pay for the postage to return their early voting ballots by mail, the postmark requirements for the ballots, the requirement that voters must submit two handwriting samples that “match” in order to have their early voting ballots counted, and the criminalization of a person assisting a voter in returning a marked mail ballot denied the plaintiffs equal protection and procedural due process, and violated the prohibition on poll tax. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the defendants to provide prepaid postage on the ballot carrier envelopes used to return the marked mail-in ballots to the counties and enjoining them from rejecting vote-by-mail ballots if those ballots were postmarked by 7:00 p.m. on election day and received by the county election administrator before it canvased the election and from implementing, enforcing, or giving any effect to the Voter Assistance Ban. They further sought to enjoin the defendants from rejecting mail-in ballots on signature verification grounds, and sought an injunction requiring the defendants to provide voters the opportunity to cure any issues with signature verification before their ballots are rejected. This lawsuit was filed at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, and assigned to Judge Orlando L. Garcia. The plaintiffs were represented by private attorneys. \n \nThe defendants moved to dismiss the case on June 3, arguing that the sovereign immunity bars plaintiffs’ claims, that the plaintiffs lack standing and that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim. \n \nThe case is ongoing. \n", "summary": "On May 11, 2020, the Texas State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Texas Alliance for Retired Americans, and six individuals filed this lawsuit against the Texas Secretary of State, challenging the constitutionality of the laws restricting vote by mail.

{"document": "Two minors and their mother and their mother sued the Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles.  Colorado law required that a teenager log a certain amount of hours driving under the supervision of a licensed parent or guardian. Because the mother is blind, she was unable to supervise her daughters' driving.  The girls' father did not have custody and lived out of state, leaving no qualified adult to supervise them in completeing the requirements for a driver's license.\t\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the defendants failed to make a reasonable modification of Colorado law, which violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a declaration that the defendants had violated the federal statutes, an injunction against the defendants' further discrimination, monetary compensation, attorney's fees and costs, and other equitable relief.\n\nUnder Colorado law, individuals who are 16 can apply for a minor's driver's license provided they have logged 50 hours of driving experience with their learner's permit, under the supervision of a qualified adult. C.R.S. §§ 42-2-104(1)(c) & 106(1)(a). Another statute, C.R.S. § 42-2-106(b) (2004), restricts minors with learners' permits to driving under the supervision of \"a parent, stepparent, or guardian with a valid driver's license.\"\n\nOn May 27, 2005, the legislature amended § 42-2-106(b) (2004) to include grandparents with powers of attorney as acceptable supervisory drivers, but the mother stated she would not relinquish her parental rights to her daughters' grandfather. Thus again, under the amended statute there was no eligible driver for supervision.  On August 10, 2005 the DMV allowed the mother to sign a \"designation\" giving the grandfather permission to supervise but indicating that she was \"in no way relinquishing any parental rights.\"\n\nOn October 17, 2005, in an unpublished order, the District Court dismissed the individual claims of the minor named plaintiffs because they were not themselves disabled. Although they had an association with their mother, who is disabled, there was no employment relationship with the defendant, which is required for \"associational disability\" claims. The court permitted the organizational plaintiffs and the mother to continue the lawsuit.\n\nOn January 04, 2006, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider its previous opinion and reinstated the minors as named plaintiffs. The court held that a party, although not herself disabled, may assert claims under Title II of the ADA and under the Rehabilitation Act for discrimination against a disabled person that directly injures that party. \n\nThe older daughter obtained her driver's license on November 14, 2005, two months after she turned 16.  She claimed compensatory damages because of the two-month delay and because she had not been able to experience driving under different road conditions over the previous year, having compressed her entire learning experience into two months. \n\nOn July 1, 2006, the legislature further amended the statute to allow the appointment of an alternate permit supervisor who holds a valid Colorado driver's license and is twenty-one years or older, without any relinquishing of parental rights or power of attorney over the child. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs continued the lawsuit.\n\nOn May 14, 2007, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in an unpublished opinion, 2007 WL 1430103. The court found that after the amended statute mooted the claims for equitable relief, the only remaining claim was for compensatory damages under Section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794. However, because the plaintiffs could not prove that the defendants acted intentionally -- i.e. with \"deliberate indifference to the strong likelihood that pursuit of its questioned policies will likely result in a violation of federally protected rights,\" they could not sustain a claim for damages. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider in an unpublished opinion on June 21, 2007.\t\n\n<b>Appeal</b>\n\nIn a published opinion on April 15, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court order granting summary judgment to the defendants. Barber v. Colorado, Dept. of Revenue, 562 F.3d 1222 (9th Cir. 2009). The Ninth Circuit agreed that the plaintiffs failed to prove intent as the Rehabilitation Act required. Especially relevant were the facts that the DMV offered reasonable accommodation by allowing the mother to designate the grandfather as a supervisor and that the DMV was aware the state legislature was progressing towards amendment. The Court of Appeals' mandate on is the final entry on the district court docket, on  May 7, 2009.\n\n", "summary": "Colorado law required minors to log 50 hours driving under the supervision of a licensed \"adult, stepparent, or guardian\" before they could obtain a driver's license. Plaintiffs were blind mother and her sighted daughters. The father lived out of state. The daughters could not log hours because their mother was not eligible for a driver's license.\r<br /><br>\r<br />The state amended the statute during the litigation, allowing the mother to appoint children's grandfather as supervisor for logging hours. This rendered equitable claims moot. The district court ruled that no claim for compensatory damages could stand for the delay in obtaining license because defendants did not act intentionally. The Court of Appeals affirmed."}
{"document": "On August 10, 1998, two named plaintiffs, both of whom had paraplegia and used wheelchairs, filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, against the State of Tennessee and 25 Tennessee counties. The plaintiffs alleged past and ongoing violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§12131-12165.  The plaintiffs claimed that they had been denied access to the Tennessee state court system because of their disabilities. One plaintiff alleged that when he was ordered to appear at a county courthouse whose courtroom was on the second floor without elevator access, he had to crawl up two flights of stairs to reach the courtroom. When he next returned to the courthouse he refused to pull himself up the stairs again and for safety reasons declined being carried up by security personnel. As a result he was arrested and jailed for failure to appear. The other plaintiff was a certified court reporter who alleged that because she was not able to access many Tennessee county courthouses she lost work opportunities and was denied the opportunity to participate in the judicial process. The plaintiffs sought money damages and injunctive relief to modify the inaccessible courthouses.\n\nOn October 5, 1998, Tennessee moved to have the case dismissed on Eleventh Amendment Grounds, arguing that Title II of the ADA was invalid to the extent that it authorized private parties to file federal lawsuits for money damages against states. On November 10, 1998, the District Court denied this motion. Tennessee appealed to the federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and proceedings in the district court were stayed while this appeal was pending. On July 16, 2002, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of the motion to dismiss (Judge Boyce F. Martin, Jr writing for a three-judge panel). Lane v. Tennessee, 40 Fed.Appx. 911 (2012). The Court of Appeals granted a rehearing on the issue before the same three-judge panel, and on January 10, 2003 it issued an Amended Judgment, wherein the Court (Judge Martin) again affirmed the lower court's decision and explained that, because the Plaintiffs were \"seeking to vindicate\" their due process \"right of access to the courts,\" the action was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Lane v. Tennessee, 315 F.3d 680 (2003).\n\nTennessee petitioned for certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.  At this point the United States of America, represented by attorneys from Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, joined the Plaintiffs as respondents. On May 17, 2004, the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, upheld the constitutionality of the ADA's application against states.  The Court found that Congress had abundant evidence that the states frequently denied people with disabilities fundamental rights protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including the right to access courts. Further, the remedy Congress enacted was congruent and proportional, because the \"reasonable accommodations\" mandated by the ADA were not unduly burdensome and disproportionate to the harm. Garrett, the Court said, covered only Equal Protection claims, not Due Process claims. Therefore the law was constitutional. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004).\n\nOn August 17, 2004, the District Court denied the Plaintiffs' motion to certify the class, finding that the question of whether each particular member of the proposed class was discriminated against because of their disability would need to be determined on an individual basis, considering the conditions of the particular courthouses, and that therefore class action was inappropriate.  Shortly thereafter the parties began negotiating settlements.\n\nIn February and March of 2005, the Plaintiffs entered separate settlements with the State of Tennessee and with each of the defendant counties. Tennessee agreed to pay the Plaintiffs $905,000 in attorneys' fees and costs. Tennessee also agreed to recommend to the Tennessee Supreme Court that it implement a comprehensive policy ensuring ADA compliance at state and county courthouses.\n\nEach of the counties agreed to make modifications to their courthouses to make them accessible to wheelchair users and other people with mobility impairments. The Defendants agreed to cooperate in the appointment of ninety-five Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinators. Each county agreed to pay $2,680, totaling $67,000, in attorneys' fees and costs. The Plaintiffs did not receive money damages.", "summary": "On August 10, 1998, two paraplegic wheelchair users filed a class action suit in federal court against the State of Tennessee and several of its counties. The Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had unlawfully discriminated against them by failing to make county courthouses physically accessible to individuals with mobility impairments, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Tennessee motioned to have the case dismissed, arguing the Title II of the ADA violated the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution. The court denied this motion, and Tennessee appealed. The appeal eventually reached the Supreme Court, which on May 17, 2004, upheld the lower court's decision to deny the motion to dismiss. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision, the District Court denied the plaintiffs motion to certify the class. The case proceeded with the named plaintiffs only. In February and March of 2005, the Plaintiffs entered separate settlements with Tennessee and each of the defendant counties, wherein the defendants agreed to physically modify the courthouses and to appoint a total of 95 Judicial Program ADA Coordinators to ensure ADA compliance. The defendants also agreed to pay the Plaintiffs a total of $972,000 in legal fees."}

The plaintiff sued the US and Frontier Airlines. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and the ACLU, asked the court for compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and any other relief the Court may deem appropriate. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants violated her right to be free of discrimination as a passenger, as well as her right to equal protection and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n\nOn September 11, 2011, the plaintiff was on a flight from Denver to Detroit. She was seated next to two men described as being of South Asian descent. The plaintiff did not know the men or communicate with them in any way throughout the flight. During the flight, the men began to exhibit suspicious behavior and Frontier Airlines was accordingly notified of a potential threat. In reporting this threat, the plaintiff was identified as part of the threat under the suspicion that she may have been traveling with the two men. When the plane landed, armed guards forcefully arrested the plaintiff and moved her to a detention facility in Wayne County, where she was held and searched for approximately four hours. The plaintiff alleged that since the police and TSA officers had no facts connecting her to criminal activity, they must have acted on the perceived ethnicity, national origin, or race of the plaintiff's name. The plaintiff was released without any charges. \n\nOn May 20, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the equal protection claims against the named federal individuals. The Court (Judge Terrence Berg) held that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity and denied the motion to dismiss.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, a motion to dismiss Count IV  was brought by Defendants Robert Ball, John Brand, Paul Brumley, Nathaniel Devins, and David Lakatos, all of whom are federal law enforcement officials or agents (\"Federal Agent Defendants\"), and a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings to dismiss Count IV brought by Defendants Jeremy Bohn, Corporal Bradley, Lieutenant M. Wasiukanis, Captain Patrick Driscoll, Mark DeBeau, Officer Grant,Toya Parker, Detective Carmona, and Officer Johnson, who are law enforcement officers of the Wayne County Airport Authority (\"WCAA Defendants\"). The motions are brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(c), respectively, and both assert that the individual law enforcement defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiff's claims that her arrest and detention on September 11, 2011, was in violation of her rights to Equal Protection. The court denied the motion. (Hebshi v. United States, 12 F. Supp. 3d 1036 (E.D. Mich. 2014))\n\nOn July 18, 2014, the court denied a motion submitted by the individual plaintiffs for partial summary judgment as to Counts V and VI. The motion is brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), asserting that the WCAA Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiff's claim that her arrest, detention, and search were in violation of her Fourth Amendment rights under the United States\nConstitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court dismissed the motion. (Hebshi v. United States, 32 F. Supp. 3d 834 (E.D. Mich. 2014), appeal dismissed (Feb. 6, 2015))\n\nThroughout the November and December 2014, several settlement conferences were held between the remaining defendants and the plaintiff--wherein a settlement was reached between the parties. \n\nUnder the settlement terms that have been disclosed, the plaintiff will receive $40,000 from the federal government to compensate her for the severe humiliation she suffered. Additionally, under the settlement, Frontier has agreed to amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and to provide all new employees with training on that revision. Frontier also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given the appropriate attention.

{"document": "This case, filed in federal court in 2011 and settled in 2012, addressed the Adams County Sheriff’s Department and its communication with deaf inmates of its jail. \n\nThe case’s complaint described an incident in May 2010 in which law enforcement was called on two individuals engaged in an argument. Neither of the two--who became the case’s individual plaintiffs--could speak, write, or read effectively in English. As a result, when Sheriff’s deputies arrived, the plaintiffs were not able to communicate or explain what had happened. Nonetheless, the complaint alleged that the deputies failed to provide a sign language interpreter or any other effective auxiliary aid. Instead, one of the individuals was arrested for allegedly hitting the second individual, despite the attempts by both to explain that no violence had occurred. While in custody, the arrestee was required to sign several forms that he did not understand, including a Miranda form acknowledging that he knew his rights. Throughout his 25-day detention at the Adams County Detention Facility, staff failed to provide him with appropriate auxiliary aids or services. He was unable to call anyone, to communicate during his medical intake, or understand why he was being detained.\n\nThis lawsuit followed. It was filed November 23, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition the two deaf individuals just described. The plaintiffs sued the Sheriff of Adams County in his official capacity under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Represented by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition Legal Program, they sought declaratory and monetary relief, and an injunction requiring the defendant to provide qualified sign language interpreters or other appropriate auxiliary aids or services to ensure effective communication with deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. \n\nOn January 26, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two additional individual plaintiffs. One was another deaf individual who communicated only through American Sign Language. He was detained at the Adams County Detention Facility for six days and unable to communicate during his detention. The other plaintiff was his aunt. The amended complaint also added the Colorado Association of the Deaf as a plaintiff.\n \nOn March 13, 2012, District Judge John L. Kane referred the case to Magistrate Judge Boyd N. Boland.

On September 25, they moved to dismiss the case because they had reached a settlement agreement.\n \nThe agreement required the defendant to change jail policies to ensure that detained individuals who required sign language interpretation knew how to request it. The settlement also required the defendants to provide training for staff, verify and monitor compliance with the agreement, and pay $100,000 to the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition Legal Program. On September 27, 2012, Judge Kane granted the parties’ motion to dismiss the case and retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement for two years. There are no further docket entries.

The suit is against County and State agencies for neglecting their responsibilities to provide mental health care services to foster children in California.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the State and Los Angeles County under provisions of the Medicaid Act, Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT), 42 U.S.C. § 1396; the Substantive Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; Article I, section 7(a) of the California Constitution; the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701; and California Government Code § 11135.   Plaintiffs are represented by the ACLU of Southern California, Center for Public Interest, Western Center for Law and Poverty, Protection & Advocacy, Inc., Youth Law Center, and Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. \n\nIn March 2003, Plaintiffs and L.A. County began settlement negotiations.  On June 19, 2003, United States District Judge A. Howard Matz certified class status, and on July 16, 2003, the Court approved a jointly submitted settlement agreement as fair, reasonable, and adequate.  The settlement agreement has four objectives: (1) to facilitate a provision of services delivered in a coordinated, comprehensive, community-based fashion; (2) to support the development and delivery of a service structure and fiscal system that supports core practices and services model; (3) to support an effective and sustainable solution that will involve standards and methods to achieve quality-based oversight; and (4) to address the need for certain class members with more intensive needs to receive medically necessary mental health services in their own home, a family settings, or the most homelike setting appropriate to their needs, in order to facilitate reunification, and to meet their needs for safety, permanence, and well-being. \n\nPursuant to the Agreement, the parties to the settlement appointed a six-member expert advisory panel to determine whether the County met the objectives set forth and implemented the plans. The Panel was required to make regular written reports to the parties and Court of its findings and recommendations. In August 2005, the Panel issued a two-year report finding that the County had not complied with the terms of the Agreement. \n\nBecause the state agencies did not participate in the settlement, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against them on September 15, 2005. Judge Matz granted the motion on March 14, 2006, ordering the State to provide \"wraparound services\" and \"therapeutic foster care,\" to thousands of Medi-Cal eligible children who are in foster care or at risk of foster care placement. There are approximately 85,000 children in foster care in California and an even greater number of children served by the child welfare system in their own homes. The court's order extends to both groups of children.  \n\n(In the meantime, on February 16, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Compliance with the Settlement Agreement against LA County. In November 2006, Judge Matz ordered the County to address deficiencies in its implementation plan.)\n\nThe State of California appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On March 23, 2007, the Ninth Circuit vacated the March 14th, 2006, preliminary injunction, holding that Judge Matz had erroneously interpreted the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions of the Medicaid Act by not \"explor[ing] the possibility that the State might only have an obligation to fund the component services of wraparound and TFC, rather than to offer the coordinated complex of services in a single package.\" Katie A. v. Bonta, 481 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\nAfter further discovery, Plaintiffs filed another Motion for Preliminary Injunction against the state defendants on January 11, 2008. In response, the Court ruled that wraparound services are Medi-Cal eligible and ordered the parties to address how to provide and bill for those services. A Special Master was appointed in March 2009 to facilitate a settlement between the parties.\n\nThe parties reached a settlement agreement in December 2011, which included the development of an Implementation Plan to be evaluated by the Special Master. The agreement included a payment of $3.75 million in attorneys' fees, including costs and expenses, to plaintiffs' counsel. The parties developed a two-phase Implementation Plan. On August 28, 2012, the Special Master informed the District Court that he found the Implementation Plan reasonably and sufficiently calculated to meet the objectives of the agreement, and the Court accepted his recommendations on September 13, 2012. \n\nThe Special Master and Advisory Panel continued to monitor and report on the completion of the Implementation Plan. \n\nIn light of the fact that the District Court's jurisdiction was scheduled to end in December 2014, the Special Master put forth a set of recommendations in his report on September 26, 2014 to sustain the growth in the development and delivery of the intensive services agreed to by the parties. The Special Master submitted a final report to the Court on November 20, 2014. The report identified areas of progress and growth, but also found that there remained significant unfinished deliverables from the settlement agreement and identified the key activities the State should begin or continue implementing.\n\nA status conference was held on November 24, 2014. Judge John A. Kronstadt determined that there was no need for the court to extend its jurisdiction at that time. Subsequently, in August of 2015, Judge Kronstadt issued a minute order stating that while the parties should continue to file reports consistent with the implementation of the settlement, the matter was considered closed. As of October 19, 2017, the parties had stipulated, with approval from the court, that the Panel monitoring L.A. County's progress toward implementation of the settlement agreement should continue to operate through December 31, 2018.\n\nOn December 21, 2018, the Panel issued its report for 2017. The plaintiff then filed this report with the court on January 23, 2019. The 2017 report identified major continuing concerns regarding the County's slow progress in implementing the settlement and uncertainty that County strategies would succeed in implementing the Shared Core Practice Model, which the report identified as a key strategy for compliance. The Panel noted its hope that the County's work would have developed data indicators that reflected progress towards full implementation, but because the County has concluded its data systems will not support those tasks, other strategies would be needed to improve performance. Among other things, the report was particularly troubled by the County's decision to change from using an Immersion Process, in which the Shared Core Practice Model would be fully implanted in only a few offices every eighteen months, to instead deciding to use a countywide approach in an attempt to reform all 19 offices and 3 specialized units simultaneously. The Panel report expressed doubt that this approach would bring the County any closer to full implementation of the Shared Core Practice Model, and disapproved of the County's decision to make this change without first notifying the parties or Panel, both of which had treated the immersion approach as a part of the strategic plan. \n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the case is now closed.

{"document": "On March 3, 2003, Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania (DIA) brought this action against the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) alleging that SEPTA violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (RA) after it completed two construction projects on its public transit facilities in Philadelphia and did not make the facilities sufficiently accessible to people with disabilities. \n\nDIA, represented by attorneys from the Disability Law Project and a private disability rights firm, asked the court for injunctive relief requiring SEPTA to make the stations accessible to persons who use wheelchairs by constructing elevators at the City Hall Station and the 15th Street Courtyard, which provides access to the 15th Street Station. \n\nSpecifically, DIA alleged that SEPTA replaced an existing stairway at the 15th Street Courtyard without making the entrance accessible to persons in wheelchairs, and that SEPTA replaced an existing escalator at the City Hall Station Broad Street entrance but did not make the entrance accessible to persons using wheelchairs. \n\nDIA's fourth amended complaint alleged that SEPTA violated the ADA and RA by making \"alterations\" to the 15th Street Courtyard and the City Hall Station without also making the affected portions of the facilities accessible to individuals with disabilities. Additionally, DIA alleged that the 15th Street Station and City Hall Station were \"key stations\" under the ADA and RA. Therefore, SEPTA was required to make those stations handicapped accessible. \n\nOn May 15, 2003, the United States District Court Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Judge Clifford Scott Green) granted SEPTA's motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure R. 19(b) for DIA's failure to join the City of Philadelphia as a defendant. SEPTA argued that joinder of the City of Philadelphia was required, because the property at issue was owned by the City. On June 4, 2003 the District Court (Judge Green) granted DIA's motion vacating the May 15, 2003 order granting dismissal. On June 12, 2003, DIA filed an amended complaint, which included the City of Philadelphia as a defendant. \n\nDIA reached a settlement agreement with the City of Philadelphia on August 16, 2004. The terms of the agreement provided that the City encouraged and would permit SEPTA to construct ADA-compliant elevators at the City Hall Station and the 15th Street Courtyard. On August 19, 2004, the case was reassigned and on November 30, 2004, the Court (Judge Gene E.K. Pratter) granted DIA's motion to dismiss the City of Philadelphia pursuant to the settlement agreement.\n\nOn January 7, 2004, DIA filed its third amended complaint, adding the \"key station\" claim. On December 23, 2004, the District Court (Judge Pratter) granted in part and denied in part SEPTA's motion to dismiss and motion to strike portions of DIA's third amended complaint. Specifically, the District Court (Judge Pratter) denied SEPTA's motion to strike DIA's allegations that SEPTA violated the \"key station\" provisions of Title II of the ADA, but DIA was ordered to strike allegations relating to an alleged agreement SEPTA made to construct elevators at City Hall in lieu of construction of an elevator at the 15th Street Station. \n\nOn February 15, 2005, DIA filed a fourth amended complaint, and alleged that SEPTA's renovations to both the 15th Street Courtyard and City Hall Station constituted \"alterations\" that triggered ADA and RA accessibility obligations.\n\nThe parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on April 5, 2006. On November 17, 2006, the Court (Judge Pratter) granted SEPTA's motion for summary judgment regarding all of DIA's claims. Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., No. 03-CV-1577, 2006 WL 3392733 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 17, 2006). The Court (Judge Pratter) held that DIA's claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations, because the claims accrued when DIA knew, or had reason to know, that SEPTA's renovations would not include elevators. DIA filed its claims more than two years after those dates. DIA subsequently appealed. \n\nOn March 27, 2007, the United States filed an amicus curiae brief in support of DIA urging a reversal of the Court's summary judgment in favor of SEPTA. \n\nOn August 19, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Judge Michael D. Fisher; Judge Thomas M. Hardiman, Judge Walter King Stapleton) reversed the District Court and remanded the case. Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., 539 F.3d 199 (3rd Cir. 2008). The Third Circuit (Judges Fisher, Hardiman, Stapleton) held that the accrual date of a discrimination claim depends on when the discrimination occurred and that discrimination did not occur until the construction was completed. Therefore, DIA's claims were not barred by the statute of limitations. \n\nOn November 04, 2008, DIA filed its motion for summary judgment. On January 16, 2009, SEPTA filed its motion for summary judgment. On September 11, 2009, the United States District Court Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Judge Pratter) granted DIA's motion for summary judgment. Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., 655 F. Supp. 2d 553 (E.D.Pa. 2009). The Court (Judge Pratter) held that SEPTA's construction work at both the 15th Street Courtyard and City Hall Station were \"alterations\" under the ADA and RA. Therefore, the ADA and RA required SEPTA to make both locations readily accessible to individuals with disabilities. \n\nSEPTA appealed the District Court decision. On February 16, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Judge Julio M. Fuentes, Judge Kent A. Jordan, Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica) affirmed the District Court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of DIA Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., No. 09-3964, 2011 WL 522947 (3rd Cir. Feb. 16, 2011). The Third Circuit held that the ADA must be interpreted liberally to provide equal access for disabled persons to public facilities. The court concluded that the City Hall Station and 15th Street Courtyard construction projects were \"alterations\" under the ADA, even though they were not \"major structural alterations.\" Additionally, the court held that the ADA required SEPTA to make the alterations \"to the maximum extent feasible\" regardless of their cost, because \"feasible\" referred to technical matters and not economic costs. Furthermore, the court held that the 15th Street and the City Hall stations were not already \"readily accessible\" merely because there were disabled accessible elevators at other portions of the underground concourse connecting the 15th Street, City Hall, and Suburban Station.\n\nOn remand, the case finally settled; a consent decree was entered September 16, 2011, approved by Judge Pratter.  The decree provided that SEPTA would install several elevators at the relevant stations, make fare lines accessible, and pay attorneys fees of about $500,000.  It also required SEPTA to provide status reports to plaintiffs counsel, quarterly.\n\nThe agreement lasted until 2013. The case is now closed.", "summary": "After years of litigation, the Third Circuit found in 2011 that SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Tranportation Authority) had violated the ADA by failing to make several subway stations accessible for people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs.   The parties settled a few months later for a consent decree that provided that SEPTA would install several elevators at the relevant stations, make fare lines accessible, and pay attorneys fees of about $500,000.  It also required SEPTA to provide status reports to plaintiffs counsel, quarterly."}
{"document": "The plaintiff was a naturalized U.S. Citizen denied boarding to a flight from Kuwait to the United States because of his alleged inclusion on the No Fly List. On January 18, 2011, he filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), the Transportation and Security Administration (\"TSA\"), and the Terrorist Screening Center (\"TSC\"), which created and maintained the No Fly List. The plaintiff, represented by the Council on American Islamic Relations, alleged that his placement on the No Fly List constituted: (1) a violation of his right as a United States citizen to reside in the United States and re-enter it from abroad; (2) unlawful agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; and (3) a denial of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring defendants to remove him from the No-Fly List; inform him of the grounds for his inclusion on the No-Fly List; and provide him with an opportunity to rebut his inclusion. The plaintiff also sought monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and a declaration that the defendants violated his rights. The case was assigned to Judge Anthony J. Trenga.\n\nContemporaneously with the complaint, the plaintiff also filed an emergency motion with respect to his alleged inability to return to the U.S. from Kuwait. The relief requested in the motion became moot, however, when the plaintiff was permitted to return to the U.S. on January 21, 2011.\n\nOn June 3, 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff’s claims lies exclusively in the U.S. Court of Appeals under 49 U.S.C. § 46110, which gave the U.S. Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to certain orders of the TSA. Judge Trenga agreed and held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff's challenge to past or future restrictions on his ability to travel because such claims are \"inescapably intertwined\" with the review of TSA orders. 2011 WL 3820711. Instead of dismissing the plaintiff's claims, however, the court transferred the plaintiff's claims to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  \n\nBefore the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the plaintiff contended that the district court did have jurisdiction, and thus, requested that his claims be remanded. On May 28, 2013, the Fourth Circuit agreed. In an order signed by the Court's clerk, the Fourth Circuit explained that 49 U.S.C. § 46110 did not evidence Congress' intent to exclude the plaintiff's challenge to past and future restricts on his ability to travel from consideration in the district court.\n\nOn remand, the defendants again filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the plaintiff's claims must be dismissed because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies, that he lacked standing, that his claims were not ripe for adjudication, and that he failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted.    \n\nOn January 22, 2014, Judge Trenga granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion.  2014 WL 243115. The Court held that the plaintiff was not required to exhaust administrative remedies, had standing, and that his claims were ripe. The Court then dismissed a portion of the plaintiff's first claim for relief, concluding that four to five day delay that the the plaintiff experienced in his ability to reenter the U.S. did not unduly burden his rights such that it constituted a constitutional deprivation. The court, however, found that the plaintiff's broader allegations in his first claim for relief of present and future harms from his inability to fly were sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss. The court also held that plaintiff's procedural due process claim was sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss as the plaintiff did not receive any notice of his inclusion or reasons for his inclusion. The parties then engaged in discovery for the next year.\n\nOn December 9, 2014, the plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment as to his procedural due process claim. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants failed to provide him with a meaningful opportunity to challenge his inclusion on the No Fly List, either before or after his inclusion, depriving him of various liberty interests. The defendants contended that the redress process established through the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (\"TRIP\") was constitutionally sufficient. On July 16, 2015, the court issued an order partially granting the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the court concluded that the plaintiff was denied his Fifth Amendment right to an adequate opportunity to challenge his inclusion on the No Fly List. \n\nOn April 13, 2015, the defendants filed a notice stating the government's new redress procedures for claims submitted through DHS regarding denial of boarding on a covered aircraft, and that these new procedures would be available to the plaintiff should he wish to use them. \n\nThe plaintiff filed a fifth amended complaint on December 28, 2015. On March 3, 2016, using arguments that are unavailable on the docket, the defendants moved for summary judgment of the plaintiff’s substantive due process and non-delegation claims of the fifth amended complaint. That same day, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment of those same claims, arguing that  the No Fly List interfered with his fundamental right of movement and was not narrowly tailored and that the No Fly List was operating in the absence, and in some ways against, the wishes of Congress.\n\nOn July 20, 2017, Judge Trenga granted the defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment and denied the plaintiff’s. The court concluded that the No Fly List was not unconstitutional on substantive due process grounds because it was not unlawful under the non-delegation doctrine nor did it exceed agency authority. As such, the court entered judgment in favor of the United States and against the plaintiff.\n\nThe plaintiff appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Not long after, however, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed this appeal and the Fourth Circuit obliged on December 21, 2017. There are no pending motions or appeals so the case is presumably closed. ", "summary": "The plaintiff, a citizen and resident of the U.S. who was denied boarding a flight from Kuwait to the U.S., filed a lawsuit against the federal government, alleging that his inclusion on the No Fly List constitutes various constitutional violations and unlawful agency action. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia initially concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded. On remand, the federal government moved to dismiss the plaintiff's claims on various grounds, which the District Court largely rejected. On June 20, 2017, the court entered judgment in favor of the United States and against the plaintiff. The case is closed."}
{"document": "On Oct. 7, 2004, the St. Louis District office of the EEOC brought this suit against Allstate Insurance Company, a major insurance provider, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The complaint alleged that Allstate's rehire policy disproportionately and adversely impacted workers over the age of 40, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC also brought a disparate treatment claim, alleging that Allstate refused to rehire certain former employees because of their age. The EEOC sought to permanently enjoin Allstate from discriminating on the basis age against individuals 40 years of age and older. The EEOC also wanted the court to order that Allstate implement policies, practices, and programs providing equal employment opportunities for individuals 40 years of age and older. Finally, the EEOC sought back wages and liquidated damages for adversely affected employees. \n\nIn 1999, Allstate implemented a Reorganization Plan, which eliminated all employee-agent positions and terminated the employment contracts of its employee-agents. In connection with the Reorganization Plan, Allstate implemented a rehire moratorium policy in 2000. Under the policy, former employee-agents who were subject to the Reorganization Plan were ineligible for rehire in non-agent positions for a period of one year after their termination, or after all severance benefits had been received. The EEOC alleged that the rehire moratorium policy had disparate impact on former employee-agents who were members of the protected age group and that Allstate engaged in disparate treatment of such members of the protected age group.\n\nBoth sides filed motions for partial summary judgment in June 2006, and in October 2006 District Judge E. Richard Webber denied Allstate's motion but granted in part the EEOC's motion. The court held that although no material issue of fact existed as to the EEOC's prima face case of disparate impact, Allstate had provided sufficient evidence that the challenged employment policy was adopted based on reasonable factors other than age. Since the EEOC had the ultimate burden of showing that Allstate's reasons for the policy were unreasonable, and had provided sufficient evidence of unreasonableness, the court held that question was not appropriate for summary judgment. 458 F. Supp. 2d 980 (E.D. Mo. 2006).   \n\nIn Jan. 2007, Allstate was given leave in the district court to file an interlocutory appeal, at which point the case was stayed pending the result of that appeal. No. 4:04CV01359 ERW, 2007 WL 38675 (E.D. Mo. Jan. 4, 2007). Allstate appealed on two questions of law: (1) whether Allstate’s rehire policy is an “employment policy”\nwhich can be challenged under a disparate impact theory of discrimination; and (2)\nwhether the statistics proffered by the EEOC and adopted by the district court\nestablish disparate impact as a matter of law. On June 10, 2008, Eighth Circuit Judge Myron H. Bright answered both questions in the affirmative, holding that Allstate's rehire policy could be challenged under ADEA and that the EEOC's statistical evidence established a prima facie case that the rehire policy had a disparate impact. 528 F.3d 1042 (8th Cir. 2008). \n\nHowever, on September 8, 2008, the Eighth Circuit granted Allstate's Petition for Rehearing En Banc and vacated the June 10, 2008 judgment. That same day, the Eighth Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and the case went back to district court. \n\nAfter proceedings resumed in the district court, there was additional discovery. On Sept. 11, 2009, the parties filed a joint motion to approve the parties' proposed Stipulated Order resolving all claims in this action. On Sept. 14, 2009, District Judge Webber issued a Stipulated Order containing the terms of the parties' settlement agreement. \n\nWith respect to injunctive relief, Allstate agreed that before adopting any new policy limiting the re-employment of former employees whose employment was terminated involuntarily as part of a reorganization or reduction-in-force, it will determine whether such a policy disproportionately affects individuals who are age 40 and above. If the policy does disproportionately impact those 40 or older, Allstate agreed to refrain from implementing the policy until it gives the EEOC 14 days written notice of its implementation, provides a list of reasons for the policy, and gives reasonable opportunity to meet and discuss with the EEOC. Additionally, Allstate agreed that any new policy would comply with the requirements of the ADEA. However, there was no admission of liability by Allstate.\n\nWith respect to monetary damages, Allstate agreed to pay a total of $4.5 million to individuals affected by the rehire policy. The settlement agreement required that the EEOC provide notice to all eligible claimants, giving them a chance to comment on or object to the methodology for allocating the $4.5 million settlement fund. The agreement specified that the court would retain jurisdiction over the case for three years.\n\nFollowing the notice and comment period, Judge Webber issued a Settlement Allocation Order on Dec. 15, 2009. The Settlement Allocation Order approved of the proposed Distribution Plan, stating that it was a fair and reasonable allocation of the monetary relief provided under the Stipulated Order, and rejected all of the claimants' objections.\n\nOn Jan. 14, 2010, Judge Webber finalized the settlement. The three year period of the court's jurisdiction passed without further litigation, and the case is now closed. ", "summary": "In 2004, the EEOC filed a complaint against Allstate Insurance Company in the Eastern District of Missouri. Plaintiffs allege that Allstate's rehire policy disproportionately and adversely impacted workers over the age of 40, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In 2009, the parties reached a settlement that required Allstate to conduct a disparate impact analysis on its rehire policies and in the event that there is a disparate impact on those 40 or older, required Allstate to coordinate with the EEOC before implementing the policy. The settlement also awarded monetary damages to adversely impacted claimants. The case is now closed."}
{"document": "On July 12, 1999, several medical, dental, and child advocacy organizations, along with several individuals, filed this class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the directors of the Michigan Department of Health, the Medical Services Administration, the Michigan Medical Services Administration, and the Michigan Department of Community Health under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by The Public Interest Law Center, in collaboration with Dechert LLP, Michigan Legal Services, the National Health Law Project, and the Michigan Association for Children with Emotional Disorders, sought injunctive relief to prevent state officials from violating the Medicaid law, claiming violations of federal Medicaid laws. \n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the state of Michigan failed to provide essential dental and medical services, known as Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Services (“EPSDT services”) required by the Medicaid program to eligible minors. The plaintiffs alleged that Michigan’s Medicaid system paid doctors and dentists too little to ensure that they would be willing to treat patients on Medicaid, such that low-income families faced a dangerous shortage of essential care for their children. The case was assigned to Judge Robert H. Cleland.\n\nOn October 14, 1999, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification of children eligible for EPSDT services. \n\nOn November 9, 1999, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Clearinghouse does not have access to this document so it is unclear by what reasoning the defendants sought judgment. \n\nOn December 28, 1999, Judge Robert H. Cleland granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Clearinghouse does not have access to this document so it is unclear which parts were granted or denied. \n\nOn March 26, 2001, Judge Cleland entered an order denying the plaintiffs’ motion to certify the class and granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss. Judge Cleland held that the substantive defendant, in this case, was the state of Michigan and that Ex parte Young was inapplicable, meaning state sovereign immunity doctrine barred this type suit against the state. While the Constitution says that federal statutes are the “supreme law of the land,” Judge Cleland ruled that because the Medicaid program was enacted under Congress’ spending power and is a consensual, contractual agreement between the states and Congress, it is not encompassed by the supremacy clause. Thus, Congress cannot compel states to participate in the program and individual state actors, indistinguishable from the state, retain “constitutional sovereignty from the suit.” 133 F.Supp.2d 549.\n\nJudge Cleland also held that even if there were no immunity from these suits, Section 1983 did not authorize suits against states or state officials for failure to carry out the terms of a federal grant program like Medicaid. The Supreme Court has required a historical statutory construction when construing Section 1983 and Judge Cleland found “no such clear, unambiguous intent to subject States to private suit.” 133 F.Supp.2d 549.\n\nOn April 4, 2001, the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit (Circuit Judges Merritt, Boggs, and Moore) delivered its opinion on May 15, 2002, in which it reversed the district court’s decision on all issues presented. The court held that conditions imposed by the federal government upon states participating in Medicaid do not arise out of a contractual agreement; they are federal laws. The court also ruled, in line with “well-established precedent,” that laws passed by Congress under its spending powers are supreme law of the land. Furthermore, while the district court ruled that Ex parte Young was unavailable to the plaintiffs, the Sixth Circuit held that because the plaintiffs sought relief from state officials for those officials’ alleged violations of federal law, this case was squarely within Ex parte Young and thus allowed to proceed. Lastly, the court held that the plaintiffs did have a cause of action under Section 1983. The case was remanded back to the district court. 289 F.3d 852. \n\nWith the case back in the district court, the plaintiffs moved for class certification on October 14, 2015, and filed an amended complaint on October 18, 2015. The Clearinghouse does not have access to these documents so it is unclear what was different in the amended complaint. \n\nAccordingly, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment on November 29, 2004. \n\nOn April 22, 2005, Judge Cleland granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ 2004 motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment. Judge Cleland addressed the plaintiffs’ claim that the defendants failed to provide EPSDT services to all eligible children by holding that plaintiffs stated a cause of action to the extent that they alleged that the state of Michigan has a policy or practice of not providing the EPSDT services to eligible children who have requested them. Addressing the plaintiffs’ second claim, Judge Cleland held that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action because the Medicaid statute did not “unambiguously confer rights enforceable under Section 1983.” Finally, Judge Cleland denied the plaintiffs’ final claim that the defendants failed to adequately inform eligible individuals of programs and services available through Medicare, holding that it was not their duty to inform all potentially eligible children of EPSDT services. 368 F.Supp.2d 740.\n\nOn May 17, 2005, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and entered judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed this judgment the next day. \n\nOn July 7, 2006, the Sixth Circuit (again before Judges Merritt, Moore, and now Chief Judge Boggs) affirmed in part the district court’s dismissal of the claims under the Medicaid statutory provisions but reversed the holding that there was no cause of action for failing to inform all potentially eligible children of EPSDT services. The appeals court also modified the district court’s order to reflect a dismissal without prejudice, which allowed the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint to allege that Michigan's inadequate payment system effectively denied many eligible children the right to medical assistance. The case was remanded back to the district court. 454 F.3d 532. \n\nOn October 11, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in the district court. The complaint alleged that the reimbursement rates provided by the defendants were so low that an insufficient number of providers were willing to care for children who were enrolled in Medicaid. The plaintiffs further claimed that these inadequate payments effectively denied the plaintiffs and the class of minors eligible for Medicaid represented in the suit the right to medical assistance. \n\nOn August 7, 2007, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement that resulted in the case being dismissed without prejudice. The settlement preserved significant expansions of the state’s program and major increases in rates paid to doctors and dentists for treating Medicaid patients. The settlement also required the state to monitor children’s access to care, which it had never done before the settlement. Finally, the settlement provided for ongoing oversight of the state’s program by representatives of the plaintiffs. \n\nThe case is now closed. ", "summary": "This class-action suit was filed in 1999 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

After two amended complaints and two appeals to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the parties agreed to a settlement in 2007.

{"document": "The Plaintiff in this case has been paralyzed from the chest down ever since an accident in 2007.  She has limited mobility and manual dexterity, and thus requires some assistance in caring for herself carrying out daily activities.

She then contacted the state in the hope of receiving Waiver services but was told she would need to spend 60 days in an institution to then be eligible for community-based services to meet her needs.

The plaintiff later amended the complaint twice, adding two plaintiffs and to seeking class-action certification. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sued both the Sheriff of Cook County in his official capacity and Cook County itself for damages under Section 202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs alleged that the Cook County Jail's policy of forced tapering of inmates participating in opioid antagonist therapy caused them great physical pain and thereby deprived them of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought class-action certification and compensatory damages for their pain and suffering. The case was assigned to Judge Edmond E. Chang.\n\nThe named plaintiffs all entered the Cook County Jail between late 2013 to early 2014. During that time, the plaintiffs informed intake personnel of their enrollment in opioid antagonist therapy. Each experienced extremely painful withdrawal symptoms after administration of their prescribed medical treatment was delayed. One entered the jail on January 20, 2014, and did not receive treatment until January 26, 2014. The second entered the jail on December 23, 2013, and did not receive treatment until December 25, 2013. The third entered the jail on September 12, 2013, and did not receive treatment until September 20, 2013.\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss the claims, but Judge Chang denied the motion on June 27, 2016. Judge Chang noted that the plaintiffs may face difficulty in proving their claim, but declined to evaluate the facts at that stage of the litigation.\n\nOn November 29, 2020, the court granted class certification for the plaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims and denied class certification for the plaintiffs’ Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act claims. 2020 WL 7027556. The court held that the plaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims raised “questions that are necessarily common to all class members,” such as Cook County Jail officials’ state of mind when developing the tapering policy, whereas the plaintiffs’ ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims required individualized determinations. The court divided the class it into two classes: “Pre-trial Detainees” consisted of all pre-trial detainees who entered the Cook County Jail between December 23, 2013 and October 7, 2019 and who were lawfully taking an opioid antagonist when they entered. ; “Post-sentence Prisoners” consisted of all post-sentencing prisoners who were lawfully taking an opioid antagonist when they entered the Cook County Jail between the same time period.\n\nThis case is ongoing.

{"document": "On May 8, 2018, Speech First, a nationwide membership organization of students, alumni, and others concerned with preserving the protections of the First Amendment, filed this lawsuit, on behalf of members attending the University of Michigan, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiff sued the University of Michigan under 42 U.S.C.§ 1983 and 1988. Represented by private counsel, Speech First sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees, claiming violations of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The plaintiff alleged that the University of Michigan’s policies and enforcement of those policies chilled the speech and expression of student claimants. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that University’s policies on “harassment” and “bullying” were unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. Furthermore, the plaintiff alleged that the policies provided no notice to students on what would constitute “harassment” or “bullying,” and enforcement of the policies were implemented arbitrarily. 2018 WL 2123702. This case was assigned to Judge Elizabeth Stafford. \n\nOn May 11, 2018, Speech First moved for preliminary injunctions against the defendant. The plaintiff sought to prohibit the defendant from: “(1)  taking any actions to investigate, threaten, or punish students for violations of the prohibitions on “harassment,” “bullying,” and “bias-related misconduct” set forth in the University’s Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities; and (2) using the Bias Response Team to investigate, threaten, or punish students (including informal punishments such as restorative justice or individual education) for bias incidents. On June 11, 2018, the United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nIn response, the defendant moved for a stay on its obligation to respond to the plaintiff’s complaint. The defendant argued that the University’s answer should be stayed until the court made a decision on the plaintiff’s preliminary injunction. Although the court noted that the defendant’s request served the interest of efficiency, it did not stay the defendant's answer. Instead, on June 19, 2018, the court extended the deadline until twenty-one (21) days from the date the court ruled on the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court held a hearing on Speech First's motion for preliminary injunction on July 31, 2018. On August 6, the court denied the plaintiff's motion, holding that the Bias Response Team did not pose a concrete threat to the plaintiffs; that Speech First's constitutional challenge to the University's definitions of \"bullying\" and \"harassment\" had become moot after the University changed the definitions; and that there was no threat of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. The district determined that Speech First was not likely to succeed on the merits of its claims because it lacked standing to assert that claim.\n\nThe plaintiff appealed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on August 13, 2018. The Appeals Court found that Speech First had associational standing to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the students of the University. The Appeals Court also found that the claims were not moot, as the University’s voluntary cessation would not preclude them from reverting back to the prior definitions of \"bullying\" and \"harassment.\" The Court vacated and remanded the District’s Court decision, determining that the District Court was in a better position to assess the facts. 939 F.3d 756 (6th Cir. 2019).\n\nThe parties agreed to settle the dispute, and each bore their own costs. The University agreed not to reinstate the Bias Response team or the prior definitions of bullying and harassment and to maintain the published definitions on the website as they were at the time of settlement.

Plaintiffs, represented by private and public interest counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that they were institutionalized in a nursing facility even though they were capable of living in a more community-integrated setting with appropriate services.  Plaintiffs claimed that Defendants conditioned receipt of long-term care on remaining in an institutionalized setting, even though it would be less expensive for Plaintiffs to receive appropriate care in the community.\n\nThe Court (Judge Joan H.

It also required the state to provide up to $10 million in housing assistance to support the first group of transitioned adults. The decree also compelled the state to develop services needed to adequately support class members who choose to live in the community. It established a monitor to ensure compliance with the decree, and granted $1.2 million in attorneys' fees. \n\nThe court approved an updated plan following the parties' cross-motion to enter into a cost-neutral plan and supplement and amend the December 2011 consent decree on November 16, 2016.

{"document": "<i>Turkmen v. Ashcroft</i>, also known as <i>Ziglar v. Abbasi</i>, is one of two related actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York by plaintiffs who were investigated and detained for suspected terrorist ties in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. It was filed on April 17, 2002 as a class-action lawsuit, but the class was never certified.  The case was assigned to Judge John Gleeson. (The related case, <i>Elmaghraby v. Ashcroft</i> (later <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i>), was also assigned to Judge Gleeson, and was settled following the Supreme Court's ruling in that case, 556 U.S. 662.)  This case was reassigned to Judge Dora Irizarry on March 9, 2016, when Judge Gleeson resigned from the bench to return to private practice.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case were men of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent who were arrested by the FBI and the INS in immigration raids following the September 11 attacks.  They were held for months in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn as the FBI investigated potential links to terrorism, but they were never charged with a crime.  Some of the plaintiffs alleged that they were kept in solitary confinement, barred from communication with attorneys, family, and friends, subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and obstructed in their efforts to practice their religion.  They sued the U.S. Attorney General, the FBI Director, the INS Commissioner, and employees of the Metropolitan Detention Center, alleging violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, international human rights law, the Civil Rights Act, and the Alien Tort Statute, seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nFactually, the plaintiffs alleged that notices to appear in court were delayed in reaching them, that they were subject to a blanket no-bond policy, and that they were arbitrarily classified as \"of high interest.\"  They claimed that they were subjected to strip searches, sleep deprivation, effective denial of exercise, denial of hygiene items and adequate food, inadequate medical attention, deliberate interference with religious rights, communications blackouts, interference with access to counsel, and denial of consular rights. The plaintiffs further alleged that they were subjected to these harsh conditions because of their religion or ethnicity, and that their continued detention under these conditions stemmed from a discriminatory policy created by high-level officials in the Bush Administration.\n\nThe plaintiffs later amended their complaint in light of reports published by the Office of the Inspector General in April and December 2003.  The amended complaints added new allegations, claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act, one additional plaintiff, and 28 Metropolitan Detention Center employees as defendants.\n\nFour plaintiffs who had been deported were paroled into the U.S. for deposition. This was the first time that non-citizens barred from re-entering the U.S. were allowed to enter for the purpose of pursuing a civil case. While in the country they were under the strict custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nIn 2007, the Department of Justice indicted eleven current and former Metropolitan Detention Center employees, including three <i>Turkmen</i> defendants. Ten of the eleven were convicted of physical attacks against detainees at the Center; those convictions did not involve attacks against the plaintiffs in this case.\n\nFollowing the 2009 Supreme Court ruling in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9788\"><i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i></a>, six of the plaintiffs settled their claims for $1.26 million. The remaining plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint on September 13, 2010, adding six new plaintiffs and attempting to meet the pleading standard set in <i>Iqbal</i>, so as to maintain claims against Ashcroft and other high-ranking officials.  \n\nOn January 15, 2013, the district court dismissed all claims against the Attorney General, the FBI Director, and the INS Commissioner (the \"DOJ defendants\"), and also dismissed two of the claims against the Metropolitan Detention Center employees (the \"MDC defendants\").  Those two claims, based on alleged communications blackouts and interference with counsel, were dismissed on the grounds of qualified immunity.\n\nThe plaintiffs collectively and the MDC defendants individually appealed the ruling to the Second Circuit. The appeals were consolidated as Case No. 13-1662; the consolidated appeal was heard on May 1, 2014.  More than a year later, on June 17, 2015, the appeals court reinstated the plaintiffs' claims under the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, the Fourth Amendment, and 42 U.S.C. §1985, against the DOJ defendants and the MDC defendants.  The court upheld the dismissal, however, of the plaintiffs' claims under the Free Exercise Clause.\n\nIn reinstating the claims against the Attorney General and the FBI Director for their post-September 11 policy decisions, the court was extending the application of <i>Bivens</i> into \"a context not previously recognized by the Supreme Court or Second Circuit precedent.\"  789 F.3d 218 (2d Cir. 2015).  It was also an innovation for the court to hold that officials were not protected by qualified immunity for punitive and discriminatory confinement and unreasonable strip searches that they imposed on detainees after learning that those detainees were being held with no individualized suspicion of terrorist connections.\n\nThe defendants' petition for rehearing en banc was denied; they subsequently sought a 90-day stay of the mandate while the Solicitor General determined whether to appeal to the Supreme Court. The appeals court granted the stay, and the Supreme Court ultimately heard the appeal and issued a decision on June 19, 2017.  Titling the case <i>Ziglar v. Abbasi</i>, the Supreme Court held that the Second Circuit should not have extended <i>Bivens</i> liability to the DOJ defendants, emphasizing that \"Congress, not the courts, should decide whether a damages action should be allowed.\"  137 S.Ct. 1843.  It held that the plaintiffs' abuse allegations against the MDC defendants did state a plausible claim for relief under the Fifth Amendment, and remanded to the Second Circuit to determine whether a <i>Bivens</i> damages remedy would be appropriate.  Finally, the Court dismissed the 42 U.S.C. §1985 conspiracy claims, ruling that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nThe Second Circuit remanded the case to the district court for additional proceedings. On February 27, 2018, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims against the DOJ defendants and referred the remainder of their claims to a magistrate judge.  In light of the Supreme Court's ruling, the remaining (MDC) defendants moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.\n\nOn August 13, 2018, the magistrate judge issued a report, recommending that the plaintiffs' claims against the MDC defendants be dismissed.  The magistrate judge concluded that Congress was in \"the best position to weight the costs and benefits of allowing a [<i>Bivens</i>] cause of action to proceed\" in the context of prisoner abuse claims such as those brought in this case.\n\nThe plaintiffs have since filed objections to the report.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for both monetary damages and injunctive relief, alleging the defendant engaged in race discrimination in terms of hiring, retention, promotion, pay, resource allocation and more. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on July 19, 2006.\n\nOn November 8, 2008 the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On August 9, 2010, the District Court (Judge Robert W.

Judge Gettleman held that the plaintiffs' disparate impact claim was not sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement for class certification and that their class as proposed failed to satisfy either category of class certification because the individual questions of law and claims to relief predominated over those of the class. 2011 WL 658155.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed this decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. (Judges Richard Posner, Diane Wood, and David Hamilton), which denied the request based on an untimely appeal. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended motion for class certification in July 2011, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court decided Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes.  Judge Gettlman denied their motion on September 19, 2011, once again on commonality grounds. 2011 WL 4471028.\n\nThe employees filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On February 24, 2012, the Seventh Circuit (Judges Posner, Wood, and Hamilton) reversed the District Court decision. The Circuit Court held that the issue of whether Merrill Lynch's policies had a disparate impact on African-American employees was appropriate for class-wide treatment because each of the plaintiffs' claims had the common question of whether Merrill Lynch \"violated the antidiscrimination statutes.\" 672 F.3d 482. \n\nMerrill Lynch's motion for rehearing en banc was denied by the Seventh Circuit on March 27, 2012.  Its subsequent appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied on October 1, 2012.\n\nOn July 13, 2012, the District Court issued certification of the disparate impact class, according to the Seventh Circuit's order.  \n\nOn December 6, 2013, the District Court (Judge Gettleman) approved a settlement agreement on all claims proposed by the parties. Pursuant to the agreement, Merrill Lynch would allocate $160 million in a settlement fund, $25 million of which would be designated for extraordinary claims. The District Court also approved service awards of $250,000 for each Class Representative and $75,000 for each member of the Steering Committee. In regards to attorney's fees, the District Court approved the plaintiff's requested attorney's fees of 21.25% (20% of the first 100 million of the settlement fund and 15% of the remainder).

{"document": "On July 19, 2011, the state of Texas filed suit against the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The state asked for a declaratory judgment, alleging that the Department of Justice inappropriately declared Texas's new districting plan to be retrogressive (that is, discriminatory, because it diluted minority voting power). Arguments focused primarily on the demographics of the state of Texas and its new districting map. On November 8, 2011, the District Court (Judge Thomas Griffith) denied Texas's motion for summary judgment, holding that Texas improperly relied solely on demographic data in formulating its plans and that there were genuine issues of material fact. 831 F. Supp. 2d 244. \n\nOn August 28, 2012, the District Court held that Texas had not met its burden of showing that the new U.S. Congressional and State House plans were not retrogressive or its burden of proving that its U.S. Congressional and State Senate plans were not enacted with a discriminatory purpose, and therefore denied declaratory judgment. 887 F. Supp. 2d 133. Texas sought review in the Supreme Court, and the case was held while the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act was under review in <I>Shelby County v. Holder</I>. \n\nOn June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court held in the <I>Shelby County</I> case that the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional in part, striking down Section 4 of the Act, the \"coverage\" provision, which controlled which jurisdictions were obligated to seek DOJ preclearance of voting-related changes. 570 U.S. 529. The next day, the Court vacated the opinion in this case and remanded the case to the District Court for the District of Columbia. 570 U.S. 928.\n\nOn July 3, 2013, Texas moved to dismiss as moot all claims brought in its original complaint. It advanced two arguments in support of dismissal. First, on June 23, 2013, while Texas's appeal was pending and before the Supreme Court had announced its decision in <i>Shelby County</i>, the Texas legislature adopted a new set of redistricting plans that replaced those challenged in this case. Second, <i>Shelby County</i> (which held the VRA's coverage formula unconstitutional) had removed Texas from the preclearance regime of Section 5. Texas argued that these two factors had mooted it claims. On December 3, 2013, a three-judge panel for the District Court for the District of Columbia (Judge Thomas B. Griffith writing for the Court) agreed that the controversy had been mooted, and dismissed all claims. <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/VR-DC-1168-0012.pdf\">Mem. & Order, Dec. 3, 2013</a>. \n\nOn December 17, 2013, several parties (individual voters, elected state representatives, and civil rights advocacy groups) who had intervened as defendants earlier in the litigation moved for attorney fees and costs totaling $1,096,770.01. The intervenors argued that they were prevailing parties and thus entitled to fees and costs under the VRA-specifically, under § 1973l(e) of the VRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1973l(e), and subsection (b) of 42 U.S.C. § 1988. These sections allow courts to, at their discretion, award the prevailing party reasonable fees and costs if the underlying action was to enforce the voting guarantees of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nOn June 18, 2014, the District Court (Judge Rosemary M. Collyer) granted the intervenors' motion for attorney fees and costs in full. <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/VR-DC-1168-0013.pdf\"><i>Texas v. United States</i>, Civil Action No. 11-1303 (RMC), 2014 WL 2758597, at *11 (D.D.C. June 18, 2014)</a>. Describing the issue as a \"case study in how not to respond to a motion for attorney fees and costs,\" <i>id.</i> at *1, Judge Rosemary chastised Texas for failing to respond (other than by means of a three-page \"Advisory\" filing) to the intervenors' motion. Finding that Texas's \"Advisory\" filing presented no substantive legal opposition, the Court thus granted the motion.\n\nOn July 16, 2014, Texas appealed the order granting attorney fees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The June 18 order was stayed pending this appeal. \n\nOn August 18, 2015, the Judge Patricia A. Millett of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion affirming the District Court’s fee award. Judge Millett found that Texas failed to follow the District Court’s rules for responding to motions for attorneys’ fees and did not challenge the District Court’s use of its rules on appeal. Judge Millett proceeded to identify numerous flaws in Texas’ argument that the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Shelby County</i> made the intervenors ineligible for attorneys’ fees. Concluding that “Texas gets no second bite at the apple now” after its procedural missteps, Judge Millett affirmed the District Court’s fee award. 798 F.3d 1108. \n\nAfter the Court of Appeals issued its opinion, the intervenors moved for additional attorneys’ fees to cover the costs of appeal, and Texas failed to secure Supreme Court review. 136 S. Ct. 981. On March 17, 2016, the Court of Appeals remanded the intervenor’s motion for additional attorneys’ fees, now augmented by the costs of opposing Supreme Court review, to the District Court for fact-finding.\n\nAfter almost a year of litigation over the additional attorneys’ fees, Judge Collyer issued an order and opinion granting the intervenors most of their requested fees on March 30, 2017. Judge Collyer noted that prevailing parties challenging voting plans or procedures are entitled to attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). The parties disputed whether undetermined fees should be calculated using the intervenors’ attorneys’ rates from private practice or the more conservative Laffey Matrix, a “commonly used” tool in the D.C.

The plaintiffs sought to shed light on the government's decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, including its justification and legality. This case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and assigned to Judge Ronnie Abrams on Jan. 29, 2018.\n\nNIPNLG is a nonprofit organization that provides legal assistance to immigrants and advocacy on behalf of noncitizens. The other plaintiff is a professor at the New York University School of Law, where she works on human rights issues and in particular Haiti and Haitian immigrants in the United States.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought records related to the government's determination to terminate TPS for Haitian nationals. The plaintiffs argued that \"[t]imely disclosure of these records is critically important because of the looming termination of legal immigration status for tens of thousands of Haitian nationals living in the United States.\" The complaint explained that TPS status protected foreign nationals from deportation and allowed them to access work authorization. To get TPS, the individual's country of origin must be designated as warranting TPS and the individual must apply and be approved for the status. The plaintiffs argued that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) required a factual inquiry to terminate TPS for a particular country after the designation had been granted; it could not be terminated without reason. According to the complaint, DHS most recently designated Haiti for TPS in 2015 and then extended the designation by six months in May 2017 in light of extensive hurricane damage. DHS terminated TPS for Haiti on Nov. 20, 2017—according to the plaintiffs, without justification—leaving 58,000 Haitian nationals in the U.S. at the risk of deportation and loss of work authorization.\n\nOn Feb. 15, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, noting that DOS had issued a travel warning for Haiti. The plaintiffs also added as a defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which they alleged had not substantively responded to a Nov. 2017 FOIA request.\n\nOn March 16, 2018, the defendants wrote to the Court arguing that the plaintiffs did not qualify for expedited processing and that plaintiffs' proposed production schedule was not practicable. The defendants requested additional time to process.

The defendants moved for summary judgment on April 27, 2018, and the plaintiffs moved for summary judgement on May 18, 2018.\n\nWhile the court considered the motions, similar cases involving the termination of Haiti's TPS were litigated, most notably Ramos v. Nielsen, et al., 3:18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal.) and Saget v. Trump, et al., 1:18-cv-01599 (E.D.N.Y.). The documents submitted for discovery in these cases were re-released to the plaintiffs in this case. These releases occurred on March 27, 2019 and April 10, 2019.\n\nFollowing the release of this additional information, and due to parallel injunctive litigation, the plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their case on April 23, 2019.

Plaintiff, represented by attorneys from Seton Hall University School of Law and the ACLU of New Jersey, sought damages, alleging that police officers violated his First Amendment right to receive and record information for later dissemination, Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures, corresponding provisions in the New Jersey State Constitution, and the New Jersey Reporter Shield Law. Specifically, plaintiff's allegations revolved around an August 4, 2007 incident in which Newark Police Department officers confiscated a photographer's camera and detained plaintiff under threat of arrest until he agreed to turn over all copies of photographs related to a murder in a rash of violence in the city described as an embarrassment to local law enforcement.\n\nOn December 23, 2009, plaintiff petitioned for judgment after agreeing with the Newark Police Department to settle the case in the amount of $55,000.

{"document": "On January 30, 2017, a lawful permanent resident (LPR) of the United States, represented by private counsel, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff was held for questioning at Atlanta International Airport as he was trying to return to his home to Atlanta, solely due to the Executive Order issued by President Donald Trump on January 27, 2017 suspending entry into the United States of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The complaint further alleged that the defendants, in denying an LPR re-entry after a brief visit abroad, violated Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The complaint was filed as a petition for mandamus (directing inspection of returning LPRs under the INA rather than under the Executive Order) and a civil complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. \n\nThe plaintiff was an Iraqi refugee who has worked for CNN since 2004 and currently is an International Desk Producer. He was based at CNN's Atlanta bureau and travels to the Middle East regularly for his reporting work. On January 29, 2017, after returning to the US from a trip to Iraq, he was detained and questioned at Atlanta International Airport, before being released. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff alleged that he was therefore uncertain whether he may leave and re-enter the United States in the future, and that this is a substantial problem, because he travels often for his work.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Timothy Batten.  On February 1, the plaintiff filed an emergency motion to expedite proceedings, arguing that the issues raised in the complaint are of immediate importance and could evade review if not expedited. On February 2, the court ordered the defendants to respond by February 8 to the plaintiff's emergency motion. On February 7, the government filed a motion to dismiss and on February 8 they filed a response in opposition to the plaintiff's emergency motion. On February 9, the plaintiffs filed an answer to the government's response, and on February 10 Judge Batten denied the motion to expedite proceedings. \n\nOn February 17, the plaintiffs filed a motion to extend the response timeline to the government's motion to dismiss. On February 21, Judge Batten granted plaintiffs' motion for an extension through February 28.\n\nOn Feb. 27, the plaintiffs filed a response to the government's motion to dismiss the complaint as moot. The plaintiffs argued that executive documents issued to clarify the EO do not change the clear text of the EO, which is still binding and still purports to exclude all \"immigrants\" - including LPRs like the named plaintiff - despite the government's clarifying documents indicating otherwise. The plaintiffs further argued that, as the EO remains in effect and the defendants have therefore not yet established full voluntary cessation of their conduct, the EO falls under a mootness exception for conduct \"capable of repetition yet evading review.\" \n\nPrompted by adverse developments in the Ninth Circuit in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15606\">Washington v.

The court additionally allowed the government to withdraw its Feb. 7 motion to dismiss the complaint. \n\nOn Mar. 23, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint challenging Section 1(g) (which applied greater scrutiny to Iraqi nationals during the visa issuance/U.S. admissions process) and Section 4 (which provides that applications for visa/admissions/any immigration benefit by Iraqi nationals should be \"subjected to thorough review\") of the second EO. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that no section of the EO removes Iraqi LPR's from the \"additional scrutiny\" and \"thorough review\" requirements, in violation of the INA, APA, and Fifth Amendment due process rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as a writ of mandamus instructing DHS to instruct its employees inspecting aliens at U.S. points of entry to exclude returning Iraqi resident immigrants from the new screening terms under the EO. \n\nOn Apr. 24, the government filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\n\nThe parties filed a joint preliminary report and discovery plan on July 7. Later in July, the parties noted their disagreement over the discovery deadlines, and discovery was stayed pending the district court's ruling on the Apr. 24 motion to dismiss. \n\nOn Aug. 11, Judge Batten granted the defendants' Apr. 24 motion to dismiss the amended complaint, finding that Tawfeeq lacked standing to challenge sections 2 (which does not apply to Iraqi nationals such as Tawfeeq), 1(g) (which the plaintiffs acknowledge would only apply to Tawfeeq if erroneously implemented, and the court will not presume that the law would be erroneously implemented), and 4 (which the court determined was too speculative to grant standing).

{"document": "On May 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated an investigation into the conditions of confinement at the Crane Correctional Facility in Coldwater, Michigan and the Scott Correctional Facility in Plymouth, Michigan (medium security prisons for women) pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  The state refused to allow the DOJ access to the prisons to conduct an investigation, and declined to negotiate with the DOJ or resolve the allegations.\n\nOn March 27, 1995, the DOJ issued a findings letter regarding the results of the CRIPA investigation, which was conducted solely through prisoner interviews during visiting hours, as the DOJ had not been allowed access to the physical facilities.  The letter detailed findings of sexual abuse of female inmates by guards (including rapes), lack of adequate medical care, lack of mental health services, grossly deficient sanitation, crowding, and other threats to the physical safety and well-being of inmates in violation of their constitutional rights.  On March 10, 1997, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against the state of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1997 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Flint office, alleging that the state had violated the rights of women prisoners at Scott and Crane to be free from sexual misconduct and unlawful invasions of privacy, and to receive appropriate medical and mental health care. The medical and mental health care claims were later withdrawn.\n\nThe case had received the docket number 97-40053 in Flint, but it was quickly transferred to Detroit and given a new docket number (97-71514).  It was consolidated for discovery purposes with another case brought by women prisoners, Nunn v. Mich. Dept. of Corrections, 2:96-cv-71416, (E.D. Mich) (PC-MI-0017).  \n\nAfter considerable discovery, the state and the federal government (but not the private plaintiffs in Nunn) entered into a Settlement Agreement on May 25, 1999. The District Court (Judge John Corbett O'Meara) approved the settlement agreement as a court order on September 30, 1999. The agreement provided for considerable changes to Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) policies and procedures relating to sexual misconduct. Among other things, the agreement included: preemployment screenings, staff trainings, inmate education, facilitation of inmate and staff reporting of sexual misconduct allegations, investigation of sexual misconduct allegations, approach and response to misconduct, monitoring of inmate bathroom, dressing and shower areas, pat-down searches, and inmate screenings. It further set forth terms for quality assurance and for DOJ monitoring for compliance with the terms of the agreement.   \n\nFollowing execution of this settlement agreement, the case was conditionally dismissed by Judge O'Meara on September 28, 1999, pending Michigan's compliance with the terms of the agreement.  The case was placed on the court's inactive docket during this time, and the parties agreed upon an expert, Patrick McManus, to assess Michigan's compliance with the settlement agreement three and six months after its execution. The U.S. filed a memo in support of its stipulation to conditionally dismiss the case in March 2000 indicating that the expert had found Michigan to be in substantial compliance with the terms of the settlement.\n\nThe court entered an order of conditional dismissal of the case on August 17, 2000. As part of its subsequent compliance efforts, the Michigan Department of Corrections established a policy barring men from serving as resident officers in housing units in women's prisons, and began the process of replacing those positions with female officers. \n\nAfter the directive to staff housing units with female officers, male corrections officers filed a separate lawsuit alleging gender discrimination. (Everson v. Michigan Dept. of Corrections, 391 F.3d 737 (6th Cir. 2004). In December 2002, the compliance expert filed a final report concluding that defendants were in substantial compliance with much of the agreement, but because of Michigan's ongoing efforts to staff housing units with female officers, that portion of the settlement would be subject to additional monitoring. Judge O'Meara granted the parties' stipulation for Partial Unconditional Dismissal of the case in February 2003, agreeing to up to one year of continued monitoring only on the issue of female housing guards, given a pending appeal in the Everson case (the district court in that case had found the Department of Corrections could not designate such positions as \"female-only\" - that issue was being contested on appeal).  In October 2004, the defendants sought full unconditional dismissal of the case, given that the timeline for continued monitoring of the housing situation had expired (even though the Everson decision remained pending). The 6th Circuit finally issued its ruling in Everson in December 2004 (391 F.3d 737, 6th Cir. 2004), concluding that female gender was a bonafide occupational qualification for housing unit guards in women's prisons. Rehearing en banc in the Everson case was denied in March 2005.\n\nSubsequently, on September 29, 2005, the Defendants withdrew their Motion for full unconditional dismissal of this action. Thus, all that was left of the case was the issue of the staffing of housing units by women.  That issue was finally dismissed on April 25, 2007, after the state apparently attested that only female officers were assigned to housing units in all facilities covered by the settlement agreement.

Plaintiff alleged that the County and officials in charge of Juvenile Detention Center had a blanket policy of strip searching all pre-arraignment detainees upon their arrival at the Juvenile Detention Center, regardless of the offense charged, or whether there was any suspicion that the detainee possessed weapons or contraband.  The plaintiff, who was strip searched pursuant to this policy, alleged that that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

The plaintiffs, represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union, asked the court for injunction and compensatory relief, claiming that their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the New York City Police Department (NYPD) had violated their rights by unreasonably searching them during routine livery cab stops.\n\nOn September 3, 2010, at 11:30 P.M., one plaintiff, a lawyer in the Bronx, was leaving work and chose to use a livery cab. The cab was enrolled in the Taxi/Livery Robbery Inspection Program (TRIP), which gave consent for the cab to be stopped and inspected by the NYPD. The cab displayed a decal that indicated enrollment in TRIP.  The NYPD stopped the livery cab, and ordered the plaintiff out of the vehicle. The plaintiff protested the search without reasonable suspicion, but the police indicated that enrollment in the TRIP program gave them the right to search passengers in the livery cab.  Nothing was found.\n\nOn October 30, 2010, at 3:00 A.M., the second plaintiff, who was a manager at a popular radio station and a comedian, was returning to his home in Brooklyn in a livery cab.  This cab was also enrolled in TRIP. The car was stopped and the plaintiff ordered to exit the vehicle, at which point the plaintiff's person and belongings were searched.  Again, nothing was found. \n\nThe plaintiffs' case was accepted by the NYCLU and the New York University School of Law Civil Rights Clinic, and a complaint was filed alleging that the search of passengers in livery cabs without reasonable suspicion was unconstitutional.\n\nOn May 14, 2012, the Court (Judge Richard M. Berman) entered a stipulation and order of dismissal, because the case had settled.  The Settlement contained $10,000 relief for each plaintiff ($20,000 total), $38,000 in attorney's fees, and injunctive-like provisions.  The NYPD agreed to suspend its routine searching of passengers of vehicles that were pulled over as part of the TRIPS program. The NYPD further agreed that it would only search passengers when reasonable suspicion of a violent crime existed.  Furthermore, the NYPD provided information that it was amending its training manual, informing officers at roll-call citywide (repeating it for 10 day periods, for three times over the next year), and issuing an operations order communicating the order to not search passengers absent reasonable suspicion of a violent crime during a TRIP stop.\n\nThe case was dismissed with the approval of the settlement.\n\n", "summary": "The plaintiffs, men of color who were stopped and searched while riding in livery cabs without any reasonable suspicion, sued the City of New York, alleging that searching of livery passengers during routine stops was unconstitutional.

The plaintiff brought the suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, on behalf of a  mixed-national origin and race family, claiming the Defendant engaged in discriminatory housing practices.  The complaint sets out allegations involving ethnic slurs and other bad treatment of the complainant family, including incidents that led to the arrest of the landlord and state court orders against him.

{"document": "On July 28, 2005 a death-sentenced inmate of the Potosi Correctional Center in Washington County, Missouri, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Missouri Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  He claimed that there was a 43% chance that the defendants' planned lethal injection procedure would torture him and cause him unnecessary pain.  He argued that this violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  He also argued that the infliction of the death penalty, and specifically the use of a form of execution more painful than necessary to bring about the death involved, violated the Thirteenth Amendment because it was a relict, vestige, and badge of slavery.  Specifically, he was concerned that that the use of the femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection would require a painful \"cut-down\" procedure, and that the anesthetic used (thiopental) would wear off too soon, allowing him to be conscious during the administration of potassium chloride, which causes a painful burning sensation throughout the body.  In addition, the plaintiff argued that the Missouri physicians who were involved in administering the lethal injections were violating their ethical obligations.\n\nThe defendants asked the court to dismiss the case, claiming that the plaintiff had to exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing the case in District Court.  On December 28, 2005, the District Court (Judge Scott O. Wright) denied their request, finding that the plaintiff did not have to exhaust his administrative remedies because if the defendants had wanted to change the method of execution due to the pain it inflicted, they would have already done so.  \n\nOn January 18, 2006, the plaintiff asked the District Court to order the defendants not to execute him until the court had held a hearing and decided how to resolve the issues in the case.  The next day, the District Court (Judge Wright) granted his request and ordered the defendants not to execute the plaintiff until the court told them that they could do so.  The defendants appealed.  On January 29, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Judges William J. Riley, Clarence Arlen Beam, and David Rasmussen Hansen) vacated the stay and ordered the District Court to hold a hearing before noon on February 1, 2006.  They also held that the execution should be stayed until midnight on February 3, 2006.  \n\nAccording to the Eighth Circuit's order, the District Court held a hearing to decide the merits of the case on January 31, 2006.  After the hearing, Court (Judge Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr.) found that neither the chemicals used by the State of Missouri for lethal injection nor the procedure employed to administer these injections constituted cruel and unusual punishment.  The Court reasoned that while the plaintiff suggested a different approach to lethal injection, he did not prove that the current method used by Missouri violated the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.  The Court also said that it was not persuaded that the use of the femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection violated applicable standards of the Eighth Amendment, and it did not believe that the Missouri physicians who were involved in administering the lethal injections were violating their ethical obligations.  Finally, the Court said that the lethal injection procedure did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of slavery.  The plaintiff appealed.  \n\nOn April 27, 2006, the Eighth Circuit (Judges Riley, Beam, and Hansen) issued a per curiam opinion vacating the District Court's decision and remanding the case so that the lower court could hold a more thorough hearing and expand the record.  The Eighth Circuit decided to do this because they felt that the time constraints that they had imposed on the lower court had been unreasonable, and they wished to allow the parties more time to present their cases.  Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095 (8th Cir. 2006).\n\nAfter holding a more extensive hearing, the District Court ruled on June 26, 2006, amended its earlier decision, ordering the defendants to prepare a written protocol for lethal injections that included the following changes:  1) a board certified anesthesiologist must be responsible for the mixing and administering of all drugs used during the lethal injection, 2) at least 5 grams of thiopental must be administered and the anesthesiologist must certify that the thiopental has rendered the plaintiff unconscious, 3) the state must purchase any equipment necessary to allow the anesthesiologist to monitor the depth of the anesthetic, in order to insure that the plaintiff will not feel any pain, 4) the state must have a contingency plan in place in case problems develop during the execution procedure, 5) an auditing process must be in place to ensure that all individuals involved in the lethal injection process are correctly following the protocol, and 6) after the Court approves the lethal injection protocol, it must not be changed without the prior approval of the Court.  The District Court then sent this ruling up to the Eighth Circuit for their consideration and approval.  Taylor v. Crawford, 2006 WL 1779035 (W.D.Mo. June 26, 2006).\n\nOn July 24, 2006, the defendants filed a revised protocol for use in carrying out the inmate's death sentence in the District Court, and the Eighth Circuit remanded their jurisdiction back to the lower court so that the new protocol could be considered.  On September 12, 2006, the District Court (Judge Gaitan) rejected the defendants' revised protocol, saying that even though it was an improvement, it was not enough to meet the standards of the Constitution because it lacked a provision for purchase of equipment that allows monitoring of anesthetic depth.  The Court ordered the defendants to submit a revised protocol to the Court by October 27, 2006.  \n\nThe defendants asked the District Court to reconsider their rejection of the revised protocol, and on October 16, 2006, the District Court (Judge Gaitan) refused to reconsider the decision.  The defendants appealed that refusal, and on June 4, 2007, the Eighth Circuit reversed the District Court's decision, holding that the defendants' proposed revisions of the protocol were sufficient to get rid of any Constitutional problems.  They also vacated the District Court's injunction that had forbidden the defendants from executing the plaintiff.  The plaintiff asked the Eighth Circuit to rehear the case en banc, and on August 8, 2007, the Eighth Circuit declined to do so.  The plaintiff filed a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.\n\nMissouri Gov.

{"document": "Plaintiffs, minor students, filed this class action lawsuit on March 27, 2006, against Winner School District and three of its administrators in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota. Plaintiffs, who were Native American, alleged that employees of the School District engaged in a pattern or practice of intentional racial discrimination with the purpose of pushing Native American students out of the school system. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the School District disciplinary practices targeted Native American students by disciplining them more often and more harshly than other students, referring them to law enforcement for minor infractions, and coercing criminal confessions out of them. They also alleged that teachers and administrators tolerated and fostered a racially hostile school environment by allowing racial name-calling and bullying to occur and treating Native American parents with disrespect. As a result, Native American students were less likely to complete high school and felt demoralized at school. \n\nRepresented by the ACLU and the Rosebud Sioux Attorney General's Office, plaintiffs brought claims under the Fifth Amendment, the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. Plaintiffs also asked the court to certify as a class all Native American students who were or would be enrolled in Winner School District's middle and high schools.\n\nOn April 28, 2006, plaintiffs submitted a motion for class certification. The parties began the discovery process in June. On October 20, 2006, Judge Charles B. Kornmann issued an order granting class certification.\n\nAfter a series of mediation sessions, the parties settled and filed a proposed Settlement Agreement on May 30, 2007. A court-enforceable Consent Decree was entered by Judge Kornmann on December 10, 2007. The terms of the Consent Decree prohibited defendants from requiring any student to make a written statement (\"affidavit\") that could be used against him or her in legal proceedings. The Decree also required defendants to immediately notify parents after deciding to refer a student to law enforcement and to notify students of their legal right to remain silent in such a case; train School District employees on proper disciplinary procedures and the constitutional rights of students; obtain an independent expert to assist with the development of disciplinary matrices; keep accurate records of disciplinary incidents; conduct evaluations of students subjected to discipline three or more times over the course of a year; hire a Native American ombudsperson; train teachers on American Indian education and educational equity; increase its number of Native American employees; and take several other measures designed to eliminate racial discimination and create an inclusive environment for Native American students and families. Defendants were also ordered to find and appoint a Monitor to oversee and report on the implementation of the Consent Decree.\n\nThe court maintained jurisdiction for enforcement purposes. The Decree was to stay in effect until defendants had achieved and maintained compliance for four years. Finally, it awarded plaintiffs $100,000 in attorneys' fees and costs. \n\nThe first and second progress reports, filed in June and September 2008, indicated that defendants had made progress in all areas. Among other things, they had hired more Native American staff members, developed anti-bullying programming, and developed a disciplinary matrix. \n\nOn January 8, 2014, the parties proposed an Amended Consent Decree. The court granted the Amended Decree on April 28, 2014. The new agreement was very similar to the original, but required that, if the School District reached all outcome measures within the following two years, it would be released from the Agreement. If some measures were not reached within that time, the District would be formally released from having to reach those outcomes but would be required to continue a good-faith effort to do so for the following two years. \n\nOn May 31, 2017, the parties jointly filed a motion to terminate the Consent Decree after finding that defendants had met all of their obligations.

The Plaintiffs, represented by Muslim Advocates as well as the Legal Aid Justice Center and the law firm of Eversheds & Sunderland, LLP, sought an order compelling the defendants to vacate the results of credible fear interviews, which had found them eligible for removal, as well as the resulting orders of removal. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and new credible fear interviews. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that under DOJ policy, parents were forced to undergo credible fear interviews while they were suffering from emotional and psychological trauma from being separated from their children. Credible fear interviews determine whether an asylum seeker faces a credible fear of persecution or torture when returned to their home country.

The plaintiffs were detainees in Connecticut Department of Corrections (CDOC) facilities who, after the expiration of the state-law basis of their detention, remained in state custody solely due to an administrative \"immigration detainer\" placed by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Represented by the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, the plaintiffs sought a writ of habeas corpus requiring the state to release them, an injunction against detaining future individuals based solely on an immigration detainer, and declaratory judgment invalidating such detention.\n\nDetainers issued by ICE request state and local law enforcement officials to hold individuals in custody, without any basis in state law, for up to 48 hours, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §287.7. The named plaintiff's state-based detention ended on February 10, 2012; he filed the petition on February 13, 2012 when his subsequent detention continued for more than 48 hours.  On the same day, the plaintiff requested class certification of detainees similarly situated in CDOC facilities. Claiming they were detained without probable cause hearings,and that the detainer is an invalid commandeering of state officials, the plaintiff alleged violation of Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable seizure.  Additionally, the plaintiff asserted that Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process rights were violated because the state lacked a compelling interest to continue detention.\n\nOn February 19, 2013, the parties entered a proposed settlement agreement based on the newly enacted state regulations. The settlement agreement states that if an ICE immigration detainer is placed on a detainee, he or she will be notified by the CDOC as soon as practicable.  If the detainee's state-based detention has expired and the detainee does not have a prior order of removal or meet certain \"dangerousness criteria\" set forth in the statute, the detainee shall not be held.

The plaintiffs were represented by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the state to redress deficiencies in the child welfare system, claiming that the state violated the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. \n\nThe complaint alleged that the defendants failed to: <ul> <li>provide adequate protective services to abused, neglected, or at risk children;\n<li>provide adequate medical care, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, sexual abuse treatment to children in DCYS care;\n<li>ensure that all children in DCYS care receive appropriate and least restrictive placements;\n<li>ensure that all reports regarding these children are investigated and responded to promptly by caseworkers;\n<li>provide sufficient and trained staff;\n<li>provide adequate records and information systems;\n<li>make reasonable efforts to keep families together by providing threatened families with reasonable and appropriate services to prevent placement into out-of-home care;\n<li>provide minimally adequate and appropriate care to all of the children, placed by DCYS, into foster homes or similar settings;\n<li>move children into adoptive or other permanent homes when reunification is impossible; and\n<li>develop and implement appropriate case plans that will assure permanent placements for all children in their custody.</ul> On January 7, 1991, the parties reached a settlement agreement mandating broad scale reform. The Court entered a consent decree reflecting their agreement and requiring the defendants to: <ul><li>establish a training academy and statewide computerized data system; <li>appoint an advisory board; <li>design and implement a management structure that delineates reporting relationships; <li>establish a health management unit for children under the supervision, care or custody of the department; <li>increase staff by hiring qualified and experienced individuals; <li>establish comprehensive guidelines and regulations to facilitate the uniform intake and investigation of reports of suspected child abuse or neglect; <li>institute standards for treatment, case management, and family training, <li>implement objectives and goals for adoptions, <li>establish regional resource groups for consultations and evaluations; <li>develop procedures to complete Probate Court Ordered Studies within the timeframes specified by state law; and <li>establish a DCYS Monitoring Panel to determine, promulgate, or approve standards and procedures to fulfill the mandates of the Consent Decree, to implement reasonable timetables, and to establish mandatory funding amounts to ensure compliance.</ul> The Consent Decree could be modified, amended, or changed by the trial judge, but only upon the filing of an appropriate motion by a party or the DCYS Monitoring Panel. \n\nOn December 19, 1996, the plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt. The defendants admitted to noncompliance and after extended negotiations the defendants agreed in October 2003 to: require the monitor to develop a definitive exit plan with specific outcomes; establish a Transition Task Force to assume all decisionmaking authority having substantial impact on the plaintiffs' safety and welfare; establish funds of $1 million for meeting emergency needs of class members; and to ensure that the governor would not replace the Commissioner during the term of this order without consulting the monitor first. Shortly thereafter, the monitor developed an exit plan detailing the necessary reforms and benchmarks that the defendants would have to meet. This plan was entered as a court order on December 23, 2003. It was modified three years later.\n\nDespite some improvements made by the defendants, the plaintiffs formally reported noncompliance again on May 5, 2008. Two months later, the plaintiffs withdrew their assertions of noncompliance pursuant to another stipulated agreement in which the defendant's agreed to comply with the foster-care recruitment and retention plans, administrative case reviews and treatment planning conferences plans, and health-care requirements.\n\nIn December 2009, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction to prevent the defendants from suspending new intakes to one of their programs, the Voluntary Services Program. The defendants responded by arguing that the children receiving treatment or assistance in that program were not members of the plaintiff class. A year later, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that children in the Voluntary Services Program were indeed members of the class. On August 17, 2010, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion for preliminary injunction and motion for permanent injunction.

LEXIS 135238; 2010 WL 5376224. \n\nIn the meantime, while that motion for injunctive relief was pending, on April 13, 2010, the defendants sought to vacate the Consent Decree and Exit Plan, claiming that the objectives of the Consent Decree and Exit Plan had been achieved and that factual and legal changes would make continued enforcement unfair. The court denied the defendant’s motion to vacate on September 22, 2010. The court also directed the parties to meet immediately with the court monitor to discuss new methods of evaluating the state's performance. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99455; 2010 WL 5590094.\n\nFor the next seven years, the monitor periodically provided the court with revised exit plan quarterly reports. The most recent exit plan was submitted by the court monitor's office on May 1, 2017. The parties were then given an opportunity to respond to the recommended exit plan, and when both did, the court scheduled settlement talks with Magistrate Judge Holly B. Fitzsimmons for later that year. \n\nIt's not clear if the parties agreed on a revised exit plan or if the court adopted one on its own, but on December 13, 2017, the Court entered a 2017 Revised Exit Plan and it appears that since then the case has continued by reference to compliance with that. That exit plan identified 14 relevant outcome measures. The plan also required the Court Monitor to conduct what it referred to as \"Certification\" reviews to ensure that defendants were in compliance with all of the outcome measures, and in sustained compliance with all of the outcome measures for at least two quarters prior to asserting compliance. The Court Monitor would then conduct a review of a statistically significant valid sample of cases to determined whether the defendants were in compliance.\n\nThe parties and Court Monitor later created a \"Pre-Certification\" review process. This intended to obviate the need to implement the full certification review for certain outcome measures after sustained compliance had been achieved for all outcome measures. Under this process, if DCF achieved sustained compliance for at least two consecutive quarters, the Court Monitor could, in his discretion, conduct a pre-certification review. The purpose of this review was to identify and provide a prompt and timely opportunity to remedy any problem areas. \n\nIn February of 2019, the Court Monitor released the Revised Exit Plan Status Report, covering the period from April 1, 2018, to September 30, 2018.

The monitor found one more of the outstanding outcome measures, relating to the caseloads of DCF social workers, had been pre-certified, leaving four outcome measures awaiting pre-certification.\n\nAs of October 7, 2020, the Court Monitor has continued to assess compliance under the 2017 Revised Exit Plan, and the litigation is ongoing, presumably until the outcome measures required by the exit plan are met.", "summary": "The plaintiffs, children placed in the custody, care, or supervision of the defendant Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Children and Youth Services, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the state failed to redress deficiencies in the child welfare system.

{"document": "On March 11, 2004, the City of Detroit removed a state court lawsuit to the United States Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The lawsuit was filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of Detroit and Wayne County, as well as the Detroit Psychiatric Institute.  The plaintiff's estate, represented by the Innocence Project, asked the Court for compensatory and punitive damages, claiming that the defendants violated his First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the The Rehabilitation Act and also claimed violations of the state constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff's estate claimed that the plaintiff's wrongful conviction was the product of malicious police tactics that coerced a false confession from a mentally ill and hospitalized man.\n\nIn 1984, a 16-year-old girl named Michelle Jackson was found dead in a warehouse in Detroit. She had been sodomized and killed.  Her death was part of a string of 47 rapes and disappearances between September 1983 and 1984. The plaintiff, a man declared legally mentally incompetent, had a habit of calling the police and offering  to help them solve rapes and murders.  When the police approached the plaintiff in 1984, officers convinced him that his confession would lure the real killer out into the open.  The plaintiff confessed under this delusional belief, was convicted, sentenced to life in prison. He remained in prison for 17 years. \n\nThe plaintiff's appellate attorney, Robert Slameka, refused to communicate with the plaintiff.  When the plaintiff filed a grievance against Mr. Slameka, he responded that the plaintiff's \"claim of my wrongdoing is frivolous, just as his existence. Both should be terminated.\"  The plaintiff was exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. \n\nThe plaintiff filed this action alleging that the detectives concealed evidence in bad faith, that his trial and appellate attorneys were ineffective, and that the result was false imprisonment in violation of the Constitution. He also alleged that the Detroit Psychiatric Institute cooperated with the police in prolonging his hospitalization and coercing his confession.\n\nThe plaintiff died while the lawsuit was pending, in 2005. The plaintiff's estate filed an Amended Complaint on May 10, 2005.\n\nOn May 5, 2006, the parties settled the case. The Court (Judge Gerald Rosen) entered a Consent Judgment. The Consent Judgment required the City of Detroit to pay the plaintiff's estate 3.25 million dollars.  In addition, there was a side agreement, provided as an exhibit to the Consent Judgment, under which the City agreed to make a good-faith effort to implement video recording by January 1, 2007, and to to submit bi-monthly reports on its progress to the Plaintiff's estate.\n\nA Satisfaction of Judgment was entered on July 10, 2007, and the case was closed. We have no further information about the City's compliance with the Consent Judgment.", "summary": "A man who was the victim of a coerced confession was convicted of murder in 1985, and was exonerated by the Innocence Project in 2002. He filed this action against the City of Detroit in 2004. The plaintiff died while the action was pending, but in 2006 his estate settled the case for 3.25 million dollars and an agreement to begin recording interrogations by the Detroit Police Department."}
{"document": "This case was filed by the Chicago office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in June 2001 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The EEOC alleged that the defendant, a telemarketer of small business consulting packages based in Buffalo Grove, IL, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by carrying out a pattern or practice of discrimination by subjecting female employees to sexual harassment. EEOC also alleged the defendant made favorable employment actions contingent upon the performance of sexual favors. The case was before Judge Joan B. Gottschall.\n\nTwo of the employees allegedly harassed filed related suits (see related cases EE−IL−0307 and EE-IL-0308), and two other employees intervened in the EEOC's suit. The discovery stage of this litigation was protracted, with several dozen discovery motions being filed over the course of a five-year period. \n\nOn October 23, 2007, the court divided the case into two phases to be tried before one jury. 2007 WL 3120067. In phase I, the EEOC had to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the sexual harassment that occurred at the defendant business during the relevant time period, taken as a whole, was so severe or pervasive that a reasonable woman would find the work environment to be hostile or abusive. EEOC also had to establish that the defendant knew, or should have known, that systematic sexual harassment was occurring in its offices but did not take adequate steps to address the problem. In Phase II, the EEOC had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that each individual claimant seeking monetary damages experienced sex-based harassment that an objectively reasonable woman would find severe or pervasive enough to constitute a hostile work environment and demonstrate that each claimant subjectively perceived the harassment she experienced to be hostile or abusive. \n\nThe defendant sought summary judgment on the individual claims in this case in a series of motions spanning from 2006 to 2009. For the purpose of resolving the summary judgment motions, the court assumed that the EEOC had prevailed in their required showings at Phase I. The court entered orders on July 14, 2008, July 7, 2009, and August 13, 2009. Within these orders, the court granted and denied in part the defendant's summary judgment, finding the harassment was not sufficiently severe for all claimants and dismissing those claimants. 2008 WL 4876860; 654 F. Supp. 2d 767; 647 F. Supp. 2d 951. In 2004, before the filing of the summary judgment motions as to individual claimants began, there were approximately 121 claimants. By 2010, IPA obtained rulings dismissing 40 of those claimants based on summary judgment and statutes of limitations. 81 triable complaints proceeded.\n\nOn October 9, 2009, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the EEOC’s “pattern or practice” claim. The court considered only the defendant’s statistical arguments (the defendants claimed that the number of individual claimants was too statistically insignificant to present a triable claim for a “pattern or practice”), and did not consider the defendant's other arguments. The court found that the statistics alone did not entitle the defendant to judgment as a matter of law, and denied the motion on March 31, 2010. 2010 WL 1416153.\n\nOn April 9, 2010, the defendant requested that the court certify its March 31, 2010 order for interlocutory appeal. The court declined to do so on April 16, 2010. On June 14, 2010, the court found, upon the consent of the defendant, that an unlawful pattern or practice of tolerating sexual harassment existed at the business from November 25, 1997 to February 14, 2005. With the order entered on Phase I, the case proceeded toward trial on Phase II.\n\nOn June 16, 2010, the defendant moved to sever the individual claims for compensatory and punitive damages for the eighty-one remaining claimants, or, in the alternative, for separate trials. The court denied the motion on June 29, 2010.\n\nTrial began in the case on July 6, 2010. After the start of jury selection, the parties reached a tentative settlement agreement, and the court stayed the trial. At that point, the parties began to work to finalize a consent decree. On February 9, 2011, the court entered an order granting the parties’ joint motion to enforce the settlement agreement reached in court on July 6, 2010.\n\nThe court entered the consent decree on March 2, 2011. The consent decree included injunctive provisions enjoining the defendant and its employees from retaliation and from discrimination against women on the basis of sex by sexually harassing female employees, harassing female employees on account of their sex, and/or creating, facilitating, or permitting the existence of a hostile work environment. The consent decree also required the defendant to implement and maintain compliance with a “statement of intolerance of sexual harassment,” establish a sexual harassment policy and complaint procedure, and provide training regarding sexual harassment. The defendant paid eight million dollars to a settlement fund to be distributed as compensatory damages to the eligible claimants, including the intervenors. The settlement fund also paid attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $431,667 to attorneys for the plaintiff-intervenors. The consent decree appointed Nancy B. Kreiter and George F. Galland as Decree Monitors to oversee IPA’s implementation of the decree’s terms. The court retained jurisdiction over the consent decree for three years.\n\nAfter the entry of the consent decree, the parties' outstanding motions were denied as moot on March 24, 2011. The Monitors’ reports of February 23, 2012 and March 4, 2013 both found the defendant in compliance with the consent decree and made certain recommendations, mostly concerning profanity, enforcement of the dress code, and restructuring of Human Resources. \n\nOn May 14, 2013, the plaintiffs moved to amend the consent decree. The motion, to which the defendants agreed, proposed an amendment to the payment schedule in the consent decree. Under the consent decree, the defendants were responsible for annual payments to a settlement account, but had not made its annual payments on time, and claimed financial hardship, so the parties agreed to allow weekly payments to ensure that final payment was fully and timely made in March 2014. Judge Gotschall granted the motion on May 22, 2013.\n\nThe defendants submitted their final payment into the settlement fund on March 3, 2014, and the Monitors submitted their final report on March 10, 2014, finding that the IPA complied fully with the decree.

They sued the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, Chief of U.S. Border Patrol Rodney Scott, Director of Immigration Customs and Enforcement Matthew Albence, Secretary of HHS Alex Azar, and CDC Director Robert Redfield. The complaint contended that the federal government had implemented a new process of removing immigrant children without providing for adequate protections, especially by holding those children away from their families or other sponsors and by not providing counsel. This process was instituted over a series of regulations, orders, and agency memos that the complaint calls the \"Title 42 Process.\" The complaint argued that this Title 42 Process violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), and that agencies exceed the power granted to them under the Immigration and Naturalization Act. They requested declaratory relief and injunctive relief that would prohibit the defendants from enforcing the Title 42 Process, stay their removal, grant them counsel, and grant the children TVPRA protections.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell. \n\nA few weeks later, on August 6, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case, even before defendants responded -- they did not give an explanation as to why they dismissed the case.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This class action lawsuit was filed on June 16, 2020 by detainees in the Maricopa County Jail system in Arizona, who sought extra protections from COVID-19 and, in some cases, release. The Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on August 14, 2020.<hr>This is a lawsuit challenging the Maricopa County Sheriff's response to COVID-19 in its jails and requesting the release of detainees and prisoners. On June 16, 2020, nine named plaintiffs and the immigrants' rights non-profit Puente Human Rights Movement filed this class action law suit and habeas petition in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs sued Maricopa County and its Sheriff under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12131), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794) and petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Represented by the national and Arizona ACLUs, as well as several law firms working pro bono, the plaintiffs sought to certify several classes of detainees and prisoners, the release of certain individuals at high risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19, and injunctions governing the Sheriff's response to COVID-19 in Maricopa County's jails, as well as attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs claimed that their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, were violated by the Sheriff's response to COVID-19.\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the defendants placed them in danger of contracting COVID-19 by continuing to book new detainees in the jail without quarantining them from the existing population, as well as a host of other unsafe practices, including a lack of masks and cleaning supplies, little testing for individuals held in the jail or jail staff, and crowded conditions that prevented social distancing. According to the complaint, the pretrial detainees' Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by the conditions of their confinement, which amounted to deliberate indifference and unconstitutional punishment prior to conviction. The convicted prisoners made a similar Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim. Additionally, the subclasses of prisoners with disabilities claimed that their rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to equal access to jail programming were violated by the defendants' COVID-19 response. Finally, the plaintiffs requested that the court release medically vulnerable pretrial detainees.\n\nThe case was assigned to United States District Judge Steven P. Logan. On June 29, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering them to improve COVID-19 safety protocols and begin releasing medically vulnerable pretrial detainees. Judge Logan denied the plaintiffs' ex parte request, but set a briefing schedule to determine whether to grant a similar preliminary injunction on July 2, 2020. The defendants then moved to dismiss the case on July 20, 2020. \n\nJudge Logan resolved both of these motions in an August 14, 2020 opinion. He denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. He also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss some of the plaintiffs' municipal liability claims against the Sheriff, but not the County. \n\nShortly after the filing of the lawsuit, back on June 29, 2020, the plaintiffs had moved for class certification. Judge Logan granted that motion in a November 13, 2020 opinion and certified two classes, one of detainees incarcerated pending trial and one of convicted prisoners, and four subclasses (two within each class) of medically vulnerable individuals and individuals with disabilities.\n\nAfter class certification was granted, the parties began the discovery process.

{"document": "This lawsuit was the result of an investigation launched by the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2009 into the alleged targeting and unconstitutional treatment of Latinos by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. (The DOJ's initial inquiry apparently started in 2008, but the formal investigation opened with notice to the Sheriff's Office in March 2009.)\n\nThe Sheriff's Office declined to cooperate in the investigation, leading the DOJ to file a a related lawsuit in September 2010 against Maricopa County under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, seeking to compel the Sheriff's Office to provide the requested information. See <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12019\">PN-AZ-0002 in this Clearinghouse</a>). Maricopa County settled that lawsuit in June 2011, and agreed to cooperate.\n\n(Also, prior to this case, in 2007, a group of plaintiffs had filed a lawsuit, Melendres v. Arpaio, against the County of Maricopa, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio. (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12282\">PN-AZ-0003 in this Clearinghouse</a>). In 2013, the Melendres Court found the MCSO in violation of the Constitution, and entered a permanent injunction forbidding racial profiling.) \n\nIn this matter, DOJ released its findings letter reporting the results of the investigation on December 15, 2011. The letter reported that the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) was engaged in an unconstitutional pattern of policing. The DOJ found that the MSCO profiled Latinos, and unlawfully stoped, detained, and arrested Latinos. The DOJ also found that services in the Maricopa County Jail for people of limited English proficiency were insufficient or nonexistent. The DOJ found that a lack of policy to ensure constitutional policing underscored these problems. \n\nOn May 10, 2012, the DOJ filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 14141 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Maricopa County and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. Specifically, the DOJ's complaint alleged that: <ul><li>(1) the MSCO's policies and practices discriminated against Latino persons;<li>(2) the MSCO targeted Latino workers while enforcing state identity theft laws, resulting in the seizure of Latinos at worksites without reasonable suspicion;<li>(3) the MSCO's discriminatory law enforcements practices violated Title VI;<li>(4) the County's jails discriminated against limited English proficiency Latino prisoners in violation of Title VI; <li>(5) the County and MSCO were violating their Title VI contractual assurances; and <li>(6) the County and MSCO retaliated against persons in Maricopa County on the basis of their protected speech.</li></ul>\nThe DOJ requested injunctive and declaratory relief to stop Maricopa County's alleged practice of depriving Latino persons of their constitutional rights and to stop discrimination against Latinos in violation of Title VI.\n\nThe case was assigned to Chief Judge Roslyn O. Silver. On December 12, 2012, she denied Defendants' motion to dismiss the case, but granted the motion to dismiss the MCSO from the case, ruling the MCSO was not an entity that could sue or be sued.\n\nOn September 4, 2014, after lengthy discovery, proceedings were held before Judge Silver in which both parties informed the court that they would file dispositive motions. On October 27, the DOJ filed its motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Defendants were precluded by collateral estoppel from re-litigating the issue of whether the MSCO's traffic stops constituted a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The DOJ claimed that the issue had already been decided against the MSCO in <i>Melendres v. Arpaio</i>, where the MCSO was a defendant. 989 F. Supp. 2d 822 (D. Ariz. 2013) (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12282\">PN-AZ-0003 in this Clearinghouse</a>). On the same day, the Defendants made a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that neither Title VI nor § 14141 authorized this suit against Maricopa County. On June 15, 2015, Judge Silver granted the DOJ's motion with respect to the traffic stops and denied the Defendants' motion.\n\nOn July 15, 2015, Judge Silver ordered the parties to file a joint statement setting forth what issues remained for trial. In response, on July 17, the parties filed a joint motion to approve a settlement agreement regarding the second, fourth, and sixth claims for relief from the DOJ's complaint. The MSCO agreed to stop unconstitutionally enforcing state identity theft laws and to develop an anti-retaliation policy. On July 20, the DOJ moved to stay this action until the court in <i>Melendres</i> (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12282\">PN-AZ-0003 in this Clearinghouse</a>), in which the DOJ had recently intervened, found that the Defendants had maintained compliance with an injunction for three years. However, the Defendants argued this was inappropriate because when the DOJ moved to intervene in <i>Melendres</i>, it had represented that it would terminate the overlapping parts of this case if the intervention motion was granted. On September 2, 2015, Judge Silver granted the parties' joint motion to approve the settlement agreement with respect to the issues not covered by <i>Melendres</i>--worksite operations and retaliation--but otherwise dismissed the matter.  \n\nOn December 30, 2015, Maricopa County appealed this case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \n\nOver the next two years, little happened in the case as the parties awaited a decision from the appellate court. \n\nOn May 7, 2018, the Court issued an opinion affirming the judgment. Judge Paul J. Watford held that sheriffs act as final policymakers for their respective counties on law-enforcement matters. Moreover, U.S.C. §12601 imposed liability on a governmental authority whose own official policy caused it to engage in “a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers” that deprived persons of federally protected rights. Because sheriffs are final policymakers for their counties, the policies they adopt are, in fact, the counties' policies. For this reason, Maricopa County should be held liable for their sheriffs' acts. \n\nOn June 21, 2018, Maricopa County filed a petition for panel rehearing and a petition for rehearing <i>en banc</i>, but the request was denied. On October 15, 2018, Maricopa County filed a petition for a <i>writ of certiorari</i> in the United States Supreme Court. Certiorari was denied on March 25, 2019. 139 S.Ct. 1373. \n\nThe parties jointly moved to terminate the settlement on May 9, 2019. The court ordered this termination on May 14, and the case has since been closed.

{"document": "On July 20, 2005, two death-sentenced inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Oklahoma Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.  Anderson and Taylor complained to the Court that the lethal injection procedure used by the defendants during executions violated the Constitution by inflicting enormous amounts of pain on the executed prisoner.  Specifically, they claimed that the defendants 1) violated medically approved procedures by failing to employ properly trained people to inject the anesthesia, 2) arbitrarily and unnecessarily used drugs and drug dosages that created significant risks that the condemned prisoner would suffer unnecessary pain, 3) used a sequence of drug administration that delays administration of the anesthetic until after the prisoner is dead, 4) delivered the drugs through alternating IV lines, impairing control over the timing and sequence of drug delivery and increasing the risk of drug administration failure.  Due to these concerns, the plaintiffs asked the Court to stay their executions and to enjoin the defendants from using the lethal injection procedure that they normally used.  \n\nOn August 15, 2005, the case was referred to Magistrage Judge Bacharach.  On September 6, 2005, the defendants asked the Court to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the Anderson and Taylor had failed to show any likelihood that their claim would succeed at trial.  On December 20, 2005, Judge Bacharach filed a report stating that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that they had a viable claim and recommending that the District Court should overrule the defendants' motion to dismiss.  On January 11, 2006, the District Court (Judge Stephen P. Friot) adopted the Magistrate's recommendation and overruled the motion to dismiss.  Anderson v. Evans, 2006 WL 83093 (W.D.Okla.

On March 6, 2007, the parties entered a joint motion asking the District Court to stay the case and place it in abeyance for a period of one year.  We're not sure exactly why the defendants agreed to put off the case for a year, but their motion mentions \"recent developments in Plaintiff Anderson's habeas case\" and states that neither of the plaintiffs would \"face execution during the abeyance period, or for some time thereafter.\"  The District Court agreed to place the lawsuit on hold for a year.  \n\nOn June 19, 2007, Plaintiff Anderson asked the Court to allow him to withdraw from the case.  Apparently, he had been re-sentenced to life in prison without parole, so he was no longer facing execution.

Jones.\"  \n\nOn June 8, 2009 the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma dismissed the case without prejudice because the remaining named defendant lacked standing.  The District Court held that \"the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's denial of the plaintiff's writ of habeas corpus and remanded with instructions to grant the writ as to his conviction and execution subject to the State's right to re-try the case within a reasonable time.\" Accordingly, the District Court found that the issue was moot as to Plaintiff Taylor, which called for a dismissal of the case. \n\nThe Docket shows that the case was terminated as of June 8, 2009.\n\n", "summary": "In this death penalty case challenging the Oklahoma Department of Corrections lethal injection procedure, two death-sentenced inmates sought a stay of their executions.

{"document": "On December 3, 2013, the University of Notre Dame, a religious nonprofit university, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Notre Dame alleged that the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) contraception insurance mandate, even with the accommodation for nonprofit religious organizations, violated the Establishment Clause and Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Notre Dame sought preliminary and permanent injunctions barring the government from enforcing the contraception insurance mandate to avoid a violation of Notre Dame's deeply held religious beliefs.\n\nOn December 20, 2013, the District Court (Judge Philip P. Simon) denied Notre Dame's motion for preliminary injunction. The Court found that the ACA's insurance accommodation, which allowed the head of an eligible organization to provide self-certification which in turn triggered a third-party administrator to provide contraception coverage to the organization's employees, did not impose a substantial burden on the free exercise of the religion. University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 988 F.Supp.2d 912 (N.D.

The plaintiff, represented by the ACLU Foundation of Colorado, sought compensatory damages and attorney’s fees, claiming violations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. \n\nThe plaintiff claimed that El Paso County had an official policy and actual practice of denying pretrial liberty to defendants granted a personal recognizance (PR) bond by a state court judge, solely for their inability to pay a $55 pretrial service fee to the county. While incarcerated, the plaintiff was separated from her newborn child when child custody proceedings were initiated against her that she was unable to competently contest while she was in jail. The plaintiff also claimed that state court judges in the county believed that they could not waive this fee without express permission from a bond commissioner of El Paso County Pretrial Services; they argued that employees of that agency were disincentivized from doing so because the $55 fee is chargeable before release funded the county’s pretrial supervision program. \n\nA little over a week after the complaint was filed, the Denver Channel reported that Chief Judge William Bain of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Colorado, which includes all state courts in El Paso County, had ordered that detainees granted a personal recognizance bond but unable to pay the $55 pretrial services fee must be released from jail that same day.\n\nOn December 28, 2017, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint with an expanded fact section, emphasizing that El Paso County, through its sheriff, was the sole party blocking the release of detainees unable to pay the $55 fee to the county under the former policy. \n\nThe defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on January 11, 2018.

The cases were consolidated despite abstention issues and in light of the 6th Circuit's decision <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=366\"><i>Hanna v. Toner</i></a>. Attorneys were appointed to represent plaintiffs, including Legal Services of Middle Tennessee, Legal Services of South Central Tennessee, National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, Rural Legal Services of Tennessee, and Legal Aid in Nashville. The plaintiff prisoners alleged that the conditions of confinement and practices in Tennessee's adult penal institutions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the state's constitution. The amended complaint also resulted in certification of the plaintiffs as a class of all present and future adult male inmates committed to the Tennessee Department of Correction.\n\nThe complaint challenged living conditions in Tennessee's prisons, ranging from overcrowding and sanitation to medical care and violence. Such \"wanton infliction of unnecessary pain and suffering,\" the plaintiffs alleged, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nIn August of 1982, the district court (Judge Leland Clure Morton) found that the conditions within Tennessee's adult penal institutions were unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment and ordered the defendants to establish remedies and submit them to the court. Grubbs v. Bradley, 552 F.Supp. 1052 (M.D.Tenn. 1982). The court found specific facilities--but not all in the system--were inadequate to accommodate a growing prison population, and mandated that the prisons cease double celling in those units. While the court noted significant concern with prison conditions,  including serious fire hazards and sanitation issues, it found them constitutionally adequate. Other sanitation issues, such as drinking water sanitation and absence of bedding cleaning procedure, were not found to rise to the level of unconstitutionality. However, the court did find that the constitution did require a level of hygiene in food preparation and kitchen sanitation that the prisons did not meet. The defendants would be required to implement a procedure to ensure basic sanitation practices. Issues of violence were found \"endemic\" to the system and warranting attention, but also \"inevitable\" and not unconstitutional. Similarly, it found the healthcare provided to inmates to be constitutionally adequate.\n\nThe court mandated that the defendants design a plan to address the constitutionally inadequate conditions and appoint a special master to evaluate the defendants' plan. Other remedial orders were issued by the court in this case, such as enjoining defendants from keeping prisoners in confinement without physical exercise for longer than one week. The defendants appointed Patrick D. McManus. In 1987, the court ordered the plans to be completed by 1992.             \n\nIn a separate litigation concerning inmate populations at Tennessee penal institutions governed by the Grubbs population orders, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Merritt, Nelson, and Lievely), remanded the case to the judge presiding over the Grubbs decree to oversee proceedings in that case consistent with the Grubbs order. Roberts v. Tennessee Department of Correction, 887 F.2d 1281. The Sixth Circuit noted that the Grubbs court should have jurisdiction of all matters pertaining to population limits and other matters of the Grubbs decree, and transferred the case to that judge.  \n\nOn May 14, 1993, the matter came before the court regarding terminating the class action.  The court (Judge Thomas A. Higgins) determined that conditions within Tennessee prisons had improved sufficiently to warrant the almost complete termination of court supervision, vacating and dissolving the injunction.  Grubbs v. Bradley, 821 F.Supp. 496 (M.D.Tenn. 1993). The court retained jurisdiction in one area to ensure the defendants created a health care quality-assurance program. The court also awarded the plaintiffs' side attorney's fees and costs.

Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief, damages, and attorneys' fees. She sought a proposed class of all female police officers who had worked for the Philadelphia Police Department during the preceding three years.\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that the PPD had failed to provide nursing female police officers with appropriate accommodations and had engaged in sex and pregnancy discrimination. Specifically, she alleged that the PPD had failed to comply with the Break Time for Nursing Mothers provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by not providing break times or a private location for expressing breast milk (collecting and storing breast milk for use later). The plaintiff also alleged that the PPD had violated the Equal Protection Clause in creating a hostile work environment where the plaintiff class suffered from disparate treatment as a result of their sex and pregnancy status, and the PPD had violated the plaintiff class's First Amendment right to petition by retaliating against them when they tried to assert their rights. \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Michael M. Baylson. On February 3, 2020, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on February 17, 2020.

The amended complaint also highlighted more explicitly that the plaintiff had to pump at irregular times and in unsanitary bathrooms, or sometimes not at all, as a result of the defendant's actions.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a lawsuit brought by the state of Washington regarding the July 2020 release of ICE regulations which, in effect, meant that students on F-1 visas would risk deportation if their school shifted to online learning. On July 15, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance which exempted students from the limitation on online learning credits in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 6, the court granted the parties stipulated request for a dismissal. <hr>\n\n<b>Background</b>\nGenerally speaking, F-1 visas (colloquially \"student visas\") can be granted to international students who attend American universities. However, regulations on the granting of these visas limit the amount of online or distance learning the student can engage in. According to these regulations, an international student can engage in only one such class or three credits of that class per semester. 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G).\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 made this regulation untenable, as schools and universities had to shift to online learning systems. In response, defendant ICE issued an exemption on March 13, 2020, affirming that international students would be permitted to continue distance learning in the United States under their F-1 visas. The exemption would apply until the end of the emergency. However, on July 6, 2020, ICE issued a new directive stating that it would rescind that exemption. This directive would then mean that international students at schools that would still be fully online would have to either transfer to other schools that were at least partially in-person, go back to their countries voluntarily, or risk deportation. The directive also ordered schools that had gone fully online or had simply decided not to have classes to submit an \"operational change plan\" within nine days, and ordered schools that would have a hybrid system to certify each F-1 student to make sure that they were not taking entirely online courses.\n\n<b>The Lawsuit</b>\nThis lawsuit was filed on July 10, 2020, four days after the directive was issued. The State of Washington was the plaintiff. Defendants were the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Washington claimed that the new directive violated the Administrative Procedure Act in six ways: 1) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it set up implausible deadlines for institutions to decide whether to be fully online or not; 2) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it reversed a prior policy without detailing any change in facts; 3) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that the defendants entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem; 4) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that defendants did not offer any cogent explanation for the change in policy; and 5) defendants did not engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking when issuing the new policy. Finally, Washington also argued that the directive violated the APA because it was issued in excess of ICE's statutory authority and encroached on the state's ability to exercise police powers regarding public health. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the agencies from enforcing the new directive. Plaintiffs also requested that the court vacate and set aside the new directive, in addition to attorney's fees and costs. \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Ricardo S. Martinez.\n\nOn July 13, the plaintiff requested an emergency temporary restraining order, asking that the court enjoin the defendants from enforcing the directives for at least two weeks. \n\nMeanwhile, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same directive, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17677&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseName%7CHarvard%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B\"><i>President and Fellows of Harvard College</i></a>, the parties conferred and the defendants agreed to rescind their implementation of the directive and to return to the March policy. \n\nOn July 16, the parties filed a joint stipulation stating that the defendants' rescission of the directive mooted the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order and that the parties agreed to withdraw the motion without prejudice.\n\nOn October 6, 2020, the court granted the parties' stipulated request for a dismissal.

The plaintiffs, represented by the Civil Rights Clinic of Michigan State University, sought class certification, declaratory relief, injunctive relief requiring the Genesee County Jail to provide safe and clean water to all detainees, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The plaintiffs claimed that the Genesee County Jail provided detainees with toxic water for consumption, bathing, and food preparation in violation of the Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant did not provide safe and clean water to detainees, impacting their health. The plaintiffs alleged that the Sheriff had overwhelming evidence that the water was unsafe to drink and caused lead poisoning after Genesee County officials declared a public health emergency on October, 1, 2015. The health concerns relating to the toxic water of Flint included hypertension, autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders, and psychological disorders. After providing only a nine day supply of bottled water to detainees, the Jail required that detainees return to drinking, bathing, and cooking with the toxic tap water. The plaintiffs alleged that the Sheriff made the decision to return to using toxic tap water for fiscal reasons. The plaintiffs estimated that 500 individuals were detained at any one time in Jail, and thus subjected to toxic water. This is one of many cases that arose from the Flint Water Crisis.

Additionally, the decree required defendants to test the water in five locations within the Jail every fourteen days for an eight week period, sending copies to the plaintiffs’ counsel. If the tests showed that the lead levels were safe, the defendants were allowed to supply water from the Flint water system to detainees for all uses.

There were no committee hearings on the amended portions of the bill and the Legislature passed the bill within twenty-four hours, even though, according to the plaintiffs, it contained changes to hundreds of health-care related subjects. The plaintiffs therefore alleged that the California Legislature did not have time to consider whether a 5% rate reduction was consistent with providing quality services and maintaining equal access to services as required under § 30(A), or time to evaluate the costs to providers of performing services and procedures as also required under § 30(A).  The 5% rate reduction was therefore preempted by § 30(A), they argued.\n\nOn February 27, 2009, the District Court (Judge Christina A. Snyder) granted plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and ordered the State to refrain from implementing the 5% payment reduction to pharmacies for prescription drugs provided under the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program. <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/DR-CA-0030-0006.pdf\">Managed Pharmacy Care v. Maxwell-Jolly, 603 F. Supp. 2d 1230 (C.D. Cal. 2009)</a>. Shortly after, on March 13, 2009, the State filed a motion to alter or amend and clarify the preliminary injunctive ruling that the District Court denied on April 3, 2009. <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/DR-CA-0030-0012.pdf\">Managed Pharmacy Care v. Maxwell-Jolly, No. CV 09-382 CAS (C.D. Cal. Apr. 3, 2009)</a>.\n\nThe State appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and on March 25, 2010, the Ninth Circuit upheld the decision of the District Court. <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/DR-CA-0030-0016.pdf\">Independent Living Center v. Maxwell-Jolly, 374 Fed. Appx. 690 (9th Cir. Mar. 25, 2010)</a>. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's ruling that the California Legislature was required to study the impact of the five percent rate reduction on the statutory factors of efficiency, economy, quality, and access to care, prior to enacting AB 1183, and that the legislature had not adequately done so. It also upheld the lower court's finding of irreparable harm, noting that many brand name and generic drugs would be reimbursed at a level below costs, thereby limiting access to Medi-Cal patients. \n\nThe State appealed the Ninth Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court, and on January 18, 2011, the Supreme Court granted certiorari review in this case and two related cases. Maxwell-Jolly v. Cal. Pharmacists Assoc., 131 S.Ct. 992 (2011). Oral argument took place on October 3, 2011. While the cases were pending in the Supreme Court, the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that the rate reductions complied with the Medicaid statute and approved a limited retroactive implementation of the rate reductions. Consequently, the Supreme Court (Justice Stephen Breyer) found that the posture of the case had changed from the Supremacy Clause to the Administrative Procedure Act, introducing a new issue not briefed to the Court or in earlier proceedings, and therefore it vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit and remanded for reconsideration.  132 S.Ct. 1204 (2012).  \n\nOn remand, the parties agreed to enter settlement mediation overseen by the Ninth Circuit. A settlement agreement was executed in April 2014 and submitted to the district court for approval on August 19, 2014. In the agreement the parties dismissed their appeals from the preliminary injunctions issued in the cases, and the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the pending actions with prejudice, subject to the Court retaining continuing jurisdiction to determine (1) motions for attorneys’ fees by counsel for Plaintiffs, and (2) motions or proceedings by Plaintiffs to enforce the Agreement through January 1, 2016. In return, under the settlement, the defendant agreed – either by release or by agreement – to forgo recoupment of any amounts paid out by the Department to Medi-Cal providers, pursuant to the preliminary injunctions previously issued by the Court, except with respect to “opt-out providers.” In other words, when the settlement became effective, Plaintiffs gave up their right to seek any further relief, and the defendant gave up its right to seek recoupment of funds that have already been paid pursuant to the preliminary injunctions. The plaintiffs reserved the right to submit a claim for attorney’s fees. \n\nIn order to acquire attorneys’ fees from the defendants, on July 24 and 28th, 2015 the plaintiffs and intervenors filed additional appeals in the Ninth Circuit to Judge Snyder's order denying fees.  However, during a settlement conference on November 16, 2015, the motion for attorneys’ fees was settled, though the terms are not available.\n", "summary": "On January 16, 2009, a group of California pharmacies participating in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program filed suit against the California Department of Health Care Services in federal court.

The district court granted the plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunction, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed this ruling. After the Supreme Court granted certiorari in this case, the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved the rate reductions included in AB 1183.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a suit brought by several Michigan businesses against the State of Michigan's executive orders requiring non-critical businesses to stop operating during the outbreak of COVID-19. The plaintiffs alleged that Michigan's orders arbitrarily discriminated against their businesses, in violation of several constitutional clauses and state law. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss after Governor Whitmer lifted the restrictions on businesses. <hr>\n\nThe executive orders issued by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 prohibited activities and business \"not necessary to sustain or protect life.\" Seven Michigan businesses that were required to stop operating alleged that the executive orders violated their constitutional rights and state law. Represented by private counsel, plaintiffs brought this Section 1983 suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan against Governor Whitmer and the Director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services on April 28, 2020. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the executive orders were arbitrary and discriminated against their businesses by treating them differently than other similarly situated businesses. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Maloney. \n\nPlaintiffs asserted that the executive orders forced them to \"close or significantly restrict their businesses, depriving them of their liberty and property interests without due process,\" while allowing other businesses deemed 'critical' to stay open, even though: 'critical' businesses must adhere to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 'social distancing'; and Plaintiffs are fully capable of adhering to those same guide-lines if allowed to reopen.\" Moreover, plaintiffs argued that the measures taken by defendants to \"flatten the curve\" and stop the spread of COVID-19 in Michigan were unnecessary and excessive. Plaintiffs claimed that the executive orders requiring them to close their businesses violated the Dormant Commerce Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, their Procedural and Substantive Due Process rights, the Equal Protection Clause, and that the orders were unconstitutionally vague. Plaintiffs also contended that executive orders violated the state's separation of powers clause and the Emergency Powers Act. 2020 WL 2079549.\n\nOn May 11, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and removed their claims that the executive orders violated state law. \n\nOn May 29, the United States Department of Justice filed a statement of interest explaining that the alleged facts suggest that the executive orders violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Commerce Clause. The DOJ stated that \"Plaintiffs have made an initial showing that the Orders arbitrarily and oppressively limit their business operations by prohibiting and restricting Plaintiffs’ business operations while permitting similarly situated businesses to continue to operate, or to operate with lesser restrictions, and permitting social gatherings of as many as ten people.\" The DOJ also concluded that plaintiffs were likely to establish that the executive orders unduly burdened interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause. \n\nOn June 8, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims were moot, that plaintiffs lacked standing, and that plaintiffs failed to adequately state a claim concerning their federal constitutional challenges. Defendants asserted that the restrictions challenged by plaintiffs had been lifted as the \"curve of the virus's spread . . .  flatten[ed],\" rendering the plaintiffs' claims moot. Furthermore, defendants argued that plaintiffs' claims lacked merit because the executive orders were \"a proper exercise of the authority given to the States to combat a public health crisis\" and \"necessary to meet the demands of these extraordinary times.\"\n\nOn June 12, the Michigan Epidemiologists sought to file an amicus brief in support of the defendants' motion to dismiss.

{"document": "On December 20, 2011, Charlie Savage, Scott Shane, and the New York Times (NYT) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). \n\nThere had been controversy and questions surrounding the legality of targeted killings since October 2001, when the Bush Administration had first contemplated whether covert lethal force could be used against people deemed to be al-Qaeda operatives. The debate rekindled when an Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was killed in Yemen on September 29, 2011. On September 30, 2011, the Washington Post had reported that the government had produced a “secret memorandum authorizing the legal targeting” of al-Awlaki. Both before and after the death of al-Awlaki, the NYT had filed FOIA requests seeking records regarding the government’s use of targeted lethal force. On June 11, 2010, Mr. Shane had submitted a FOIA request to DOJ seeking a copy of “all Office of Legal Counsel opinions or memoranda since 2001 that addresses the legal status of targeted killings, assassination, or killing of people suspected of ties to Al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups by employees or contractors of the United States government.” However, the DOJ had denied the FOIA request, maintaining that all responsive records were being withheld pursuant to FOIA exemptions. On October 7, 2011, Mr. Savage submitted a similar FOIA request and were denied for similar reasons. \n\nIn their complaint, the plaintiffs requested that the records requested by the NYT be declared public, or that the court conduct an in camera review to determine whether any parts of the memoranda are properly public under FOIA; that the DOJ provide the records; and that the court award the NYT attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nOn June 20, 2012, the DOJ filed a motion for summary judgment, and on July 18, 2012, the NYT filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On January 2, 2013, District Judge Colleen McMahon granted the DOJ’s motion for summary judgment and denied the NYT’s cross-motion (the court filed a corrected opinion on January 22, 2013 that corrected several grammatical and typographical errors; however, the corrected opinion was substantively identical to the original opinion). Judge McMahon stated that she found herself in a “a veritable Catch-22” and that she could not find any way “around the ticket of laws and precedents that effectively allow the Executive Branch of our Government to proclaim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our Constitution and laws, while keeping the reasons for its conclusion a secret.” However, under the law, Judge McMahon found that the DOJ had not violated FOIA by refusing to turn over the documents sought in the FOIA requests and that their motion for summary judgment had to be granted. Nearly all of the documents located in response to the plaintiffs’ FOIA requests were classified, and the appropriate authorities from each of the responding agencies had filed affidavits; Judge McMahon found that there was no evidence suggesting that the proper procedures were not followed when these documents were classified. She noted that the DOJ had submitted additional material to the court for ex parte and for in camera review in support of its position; however, due to their classified nature, she filed a separate, classified appendix to her opinion, which was filed under seal and was not made available to the plaintiffs. 915 F.Supp.2d 508. \n\nOn January 31, 2013, the plaintiffs appealed Judge McMahon’s grant of summary judgment to the DOJ to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On April 21, 2014, the appeals court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. In particular, it found that the DOJ had improperly submitted a “no number, no list” response, which acknowledges the existence of documents responsive to a FOIA request but does not identify nor number them, to the NYT’s first FOIA request instead of submitting the usual “Vaughn index,” which numbers and identifies by title and description documents that are being withheld and specifies the FOIA exemptions asserted. Additionally, the appeals court found that the DOJ had insufficiently justified submitted a “Glomar response,” which neither confirms nor denies the existence of documents responsive to a FOIA request, in response to NYT’s second FOIA request. Therefore, the appeals court ordered that the DOJ submit a redacted version of a classified Vaughn index. 752 F.3d 123.\n\nOn June 23, 2014, the appeals court ordered that the DOJ disclose a 2010 document known as the “OLC-DOD Memorandum,” which was a legal opinion prepared by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the DOJ advising as to the legality of targeted drone attacks. The appeals court had found that prior disclosures by senior officials of the government had resulted in waiver of all applicable exemptions for protection of the OLC-DOD memorandum. 756 F.3d 100.

{"document": "On November 22, 2013, a man that had been in custody for twenty-five years for a crime committed when he was sixteen filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.  The plaintiff sued the Iowa Board of Parole and the Iowa Department of Corrections (IDOC) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  The plaintiff, represented by the University of Iowa Law School Clinic, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the parole board’s actions and policies violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n \nSpecifically, the plaintiff claimed that he was being denied the opportunity for meaningful release while he was being detained under a mandatory adult life sentence for the crime he committed when he was sixteen. The plaintiff was not attempting to invalidate his life sentence, rather he was requesting a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on his youth at the time the crime was committed combined with his demonstrated rehabilitation and maturity during the time he had already spent in prison. In <i>Graham v. Florida</i>, the Supreme Court stated that “Constitution prohibits the imposition of a life without parole sentence on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide” and to sentence otherwise was cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment 130 S.Ct. 2011, 2034 (2010). Under <i>Graham</i>, the State is required to give juvenile offenders who did not commit homicide a meaningful opportunity to obtain release. \n\nThe plaintiff had previously filed a motion to correct his illegal sentence on October 15, 2010 in a separate lawsuit, filed in Iowa State Court. The motion was granted by Judge Carroll, who resentenced the plaintiff to life with eligibility for parole.  The amended sentence established that the plaintiff was then eligible for parole as he had served past the statutory minimum of twenty-five years.  The plaintiff applied for parole several times and was summarily denied based on the grounds of the seriousness of the offense he committed.  No other grounds, such as the fact that he was an exemplary inmate for nearly thirty years and had only one minor infraction during that time, were considered during the parole review.  \n\nIn addition to the policies that failed to take into account the plaintiff’s youth at the time and demonstrated maturity over the course of imprisonment, the parole board also required that the plaintiff take sex offender courses due to the nature of his crime. The plaintiff attempted to enroll in these courses, but was denied because of the Department of Corrections’ enrollment policy. Under IDOC policy, an inmate was only eligible to take the course if there were within two years of their date of discharge. Since inmates serving a life sentence lack a date of discharge, they are permanently unable to enroll in the classes required by the parole board.  As a result, the plaintiff claimed that the IDOC had failed to implement any policies that would give the plaintiff a meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on rehabilitation and demonstrated maturity.  \n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 7, 2014. On January 15, 2015, the court (Judge Robert Pratt) denied the defendant’s motion. The court found that the plaintiff did, in fact, state a plausible claim that the defendants violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by denying him a meaningful opportunity to obtain release, denying the motion in its entirety. 79 F.Supp.3d 933.\n\nThe parties then engaged in discovery for more than two years. \n\nAccording to a status report filed on June 15, 2017, the plaintiff was granted work release status.\n\nOn October 3, 2017, the parties filed stipulation of dismissal of all claims without prejudice, which the court granted the next day. No reasons were provided. The case is now closed.", "summary": "This case was filed on November 23, 2013 and alleges that the Iowa Department of Corrections violated an inmate’s right to due process and protection from cruel and unusual punishment by denying him a meaningful opportunity for parole.  The inmate was a juvenile offender, but was sentenced to a mandatory adult life sentence without parole.  The Supreme Court eventually deemed it unconstitutional to give juveniles life sentences without parole, so the plaintiff was resentenced to life with parole and was applying to be released based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.

{"document": "On April 15, 1992, the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty and ten parents of homeless, school-age children filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the District of D.C., seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty and private counsel, sued the District of Columbia and D.C. Public Schools under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the McKinney Act and the Fifth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. The case was assigned to Judge Royce Lamberth.\n\nThe McKinney Act was passed in 1987 to assure that homeless children had equal access to free education and to improve the educational experience of homeless children. The Act required state plans that required the state educational agency to make determinations about which school each homeless child should attend based on their best interest, and to provide the child with services comparable to the services offered to other students - including transportation services, programs for vocational education, and school meal programs. The plaintiffs alleged that the District of Columbia violated the Act because it had:<blockquote> (1) Failed to implement a best interest standard in placing homeless children in schools; (2) failed to ensure transportation to and from the school that [was] in the best interest of homeless children to attend; (3) failed to coordinate social services and public education for homeless children, and to ensure access to comparable educational services and school meal programs; and (4) failed to provide access to free, appropriate public education for homeless children.</blockquote> The plaintiffs also alleged that the District of Columbia had violated their Equal Protection rights by providing transportation assistance to handicapped children but not providing transportation to homeless children, despite the two groups of children being similarly situated. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction concurrently with the complaint.\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that there was no private right of action under the McKinney Act and that the plaintiffs had not stated a valid Equal Protection claim. \n\nOn June 9, 1992, Judge Lamberth granted the defendants' motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction as moot. 1992 WL 151813. He held that the McKinney Act did not have a private right of action and that Equal Protection claims failed because the defendants had a rational basis for treating homeless children and handicapped children differently with respect to transportation assistance. \n\nAfter plaintiffs appealled, on August 22, 1994, the appellate court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. The court held that the McKinney Act did confer enforceable rights on its beneficiaries, so the plaintiffs could bring a § 1983 claim. 27 F.3d 605. The defendants sought review by the Supreme Court, which denied certiorari on November 28, 1994. 115 S. Ct. 578.\n\nOn remand, the plaintiffs renewed their motion for preliminary injunction on September 12, 1994, and filed an amended complaint on September 21. On November 18, 1994, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on November 21, 1994.\n\nOn March 7, 1995, Judge Lamberth granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that the defendants had violated the McKinney Act by failing to address the educational needs of homeless children and by failing to provide adequate transportation. 879 F. Supp. 116. The court entered an injunction, requiring defendants to identify homeless children the first time they reported to the intake center and arrange for appropriate educational services at that time.

{"document": "On February 27, 2013, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed this lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for failure to release information in response to EPIC's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The FOIA request was filed on July 10, 2012 regarding the disclosure of a communication shutdown procedure approved by DHS. EPIC claimed that DHS's failure to respond to an administrative appeal violated the statutory deadline imposed by FOIA. Additionally, EPIC claims that DHS failed to make a reasonable effort to search for the documents requested and that DHS was unlawfully withholding said documents. The EPIC requested injunctive relief from the court to compel immediate disclosure of the relevant records.\n\nThe FOIA request was for disclosure of records related to a communication shutdown procedure called Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 303 described in the <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2006-2007%20NSTAC%20Issue%20Review_0.pdf\">2006-07 DHS Issue Review </a> as codifying a \"shutdown and restoration process for use by commercial and private wireless networks during national crises\" to prevent the remote detonation of bombs. \n\nOn July 11, 2011 a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) officer in San Francisco shot and killed a homeless man. He later alleged that the homeless man had a knife and that the officer had shot him in self defense. This resulted in a major protest against BART. The second protest on August 12, 2011 was cut short when BART supposedly used the SOP 303 communication shutdown procedure to shut off all cellular service in several of its transit stations for three hours.  \n\nDHS responded to EPIC's FOIA request on August 21, 2012 notifying EPIC that DHS was unable to locate or identify the records requested. EPIC administratively appealed this response on September 13, 2012. DHS, which was statutorily required by FOIA to respond to an administrative appeal within 20 days, did not submit a timely response. \n\nOn May 20, 2013, Judge James E. Boasberg ordered the disclosure of any segregable portions of SOP 303. On June 28, 2013, DHS disclosed the document, but withheld portions under FOIA exemptions 6 and 7(C), 7(E), and 7(D) on the grounds that they included personal information of DHS officials, techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or endangered the life of any individual. At the same time, DHS moved for summary judgment and EPIC made a cross-motion for summary judgment. On November 12, 2013 Judge James E. Boasberg granted EPIC's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that DHS's invocation of exemptions 7(E) and 7(D) were improper, and stayed the order pending the defendant's appeal to the DC Circuit Court. \n\nOn June 1, 2015, The DC Circuit Court reversed and remanded the case to the district court to determine whether any segregable portions of SOP 303 could be disclosed. \n\nOn July 10, 2015, DHS submitted a redacted version of SOP 303 to Judge Boasberg, who decided consistent with the court of appeals' decision that DHS did not need to disclose any further information and entered judgment in favor DHS. \n\nAfterwards, the parties litigated regarding DHS's payment of EPIC's attorney's fees. On July 18, 2016, the judge granted in part the motion for attorney's fees totaling $20,145.04.\n\nThe case is now closed. \n\n\t", "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) adopted a communication shutdown procedure (SOP 303) intended to prevent the remote detonation of bombs without publicly disclosing the content of the procedure.

{"document": "On August 8, 2013, detainees of the Costa County Juvenile Hall filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Contra Costa County, California. The plaintiffs, represented by counsel from the Disability Rights Advocates, alleged that defendants discriminated against disabled youth in the Contra Costa County Juvenile Hall. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that because Contra Costa County denied the plaintiffs special education and related services, the plaintiffs misbehaved and were punished; during punishment, the plaintiffs were placed in solitary confinement for at least 22 hours per day, which made their disabilities worse and made the plaintiffs more likely to misbehave again. The plaintiffs alleged that the solitary confinement, denial of rehabilitative services while in solitary confinement, and denial of special education and other services even while out of solitary confinement violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), the American Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and three state anti-discrimination laws. Plaintiffs sought class certification, declaratory judgment, injunctive relief with monitoring by a special master, and attorney fees.\n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Saundra B. Armstrong. Over the next year, the defendants moved to dismiss the case, and the plaintiffs moved for class certification. The plaintiffs amended their complaint to drop all defendants except Contra Costa County and Contra Costa County Office of Education. As a result, Judge Armstrong denied as moot the motions for dismissal and class certification, and both parties refiled their motions to include the updated parties and proceedings. \n\nOn January 16, 2014, the County filed three separate suits in this same Court, one against each plaintiff, arguing that the underlying Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) for California improperly found that the County's Probation Department could be sued under the IDEA. The County requested attorney fees for the appeal and that the Court set aside the OAH findings. The plaintiffs moved to consolidate their action with the County's three suits, but the Court deferred litigation on the County's claims until a decision was made on its motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims.\n\nOn February 13, 2014, the United States filed a Statement of Interest concerning protection of detained youth, especially when solitary confinement was involved. The U.S. explained that it had an interest in the case because of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, which allows the U.S. to investigate juvenile detention facilities for unlawful detention practices. The U.S. argued that the County had a duty to provide services, activities and programs to qualified youth, and that the law does not allow discrimination based on disabilities. For that reason, the U.S. requested that the Court consider the Statement of Interest and deny defendants' motion to dismiss.\n\nFollowing extensive negotiations, the plaintiffs reached settlement agreements with both Contra Costa County and the Contra Costa County Office of Education. On November 25, 2015, the court (Judge Maria-Elena James) approved the settlement agreements. 2015 WL 7571789.\n\nUnder the settlement agreement with Contra Costa County, the County would no longer use solitary confinement for discipline, punishment, administrative convenience, retaliation, staffing shortages, or reasons other than a temporary response to behavior that threatens immediate harm to the youth or others. In line with national standards, the County could segregate a youth in his or her room for no more than four hours but only if the youth’s behavior risked immediate harm to themselves or others. After four hours, the Probation Department had to remove the youth from confinement, develop specialized individualized programming for the youth, or assess whether the youth should be transported to a mental health facility. \n\nUnder the settlement agreement with the Contra Costa County Office of Education, the County Office of Education would retain an outside expert to evaluate its compliance with federal and state special education laws and to ensure that the students with disabilities in Juvenile Hall would receive the special education that they need. The expert would make recommended revisions to policies, procedures and practices as they relate to Child Find, development and implementation of individualized education plans, and discipline, which the County’s Board of Education will adopt. \n\nThe defendants also agreed to pay $1,340,000 in attorneys' fees. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreements, which were scheduled to last for four years. On December 18, 2015, the court approved the parties' motion to modify the settlement agreements' procedures for choosing experts to monitor implementation.

Spero for a status conference to discuss disputes between the parties regarding implementation of the settlement agreement.

{"document": "On January 13, 2011, New York wheelchair users and several disability rights organizations filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The plaintiffs sued the the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the New York City Human Rights Law. Represented by Disabilities Right Advocates, the plaintiffs claimed the TLC failed to give meaningful access to persons with disabilities when issuing its regulations for the design of the next generation of NYC taxicabs. \n\nAccording to the complaint, only 1.8% of taxis were accessible to persons with mobility disabilities, which deprived them of meaningful access to New York City without using more expensive alternatives. In addition, the Taxi & Limousine Commission had recently approved of specific Nissan models of SUVs and hybrid automobiles for the next generation of NYC taxicabs. The complaint alleged that the SUVs were too high for wheelchair access and that the hybrids' trunk space could not accommodate a wheelchair, including the folding model. \n\nThe TLC responded in early March by filing a motion to dismiss. Judge George B. Daniels held an oral argument over the motion and denied the TLC's motion, as well as their motion for interlocutory appeal. The case proceeded with discovery and, on August 10, 2011, Judge Daniels granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification. \n\nThe plaintiffs then filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment, and several interested parties filed Amicus Curiae briefs in response to the motion. On December 23, 2011, Judge Daniels entered partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, holding the defendants liable under Title II of the ADA, and granted plaintiffs a temporary restraining order. The order required all new taxi medallions and livery services to be limited to accessible vehicles until TLC came up with a plan for meaningful access to persons who use wheelchairs. 837 F.Supp.2d 268.\n\nThe defendants filed another interlocutory appeal, which was granted. The injunction was stayed pending the appeal.  On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated both the temporary restraining order and the partial summary judgment.  The Court concluded that although the TLC exercised \"pervasive control\" over the taxi industry in New York City, it was not mandated by Title II to provide meaningful access to taxis. 687 F.3d 63.\n\nThe case was remanded to determine the plaintiffs' claims under Title II(B) (which governs public transportation), the Rehab Act, and the New York City Human Rights Law. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and another motion for partial summary judgment. The district court heard oral arguments on the motion for summary judgment on October 11, 2013.  The parties entered settlement discussions shortly thereafter, and as a result the court did not make a formal ruling on the matter. \n\nInstead, on February 18, 2014, the court terminated the summary judgment motion as moot due to settlement, which was approved by Judge Daniels on June 10, 2014.  \n\nIn the settlement, TLC agreed that at least 50% of the new taxicab vehicles put into circulation from the time of the settlement until the year 2020 would be wheelchair accessible, with the goal of having 50% of the fleet accessible by 2020. The defendants also agreed to regularly report their progress to the plaintiffs.\n\nThe parties did not agree on attorneys fees in the settlement, and the matter was subsequently referred to the court-annexed mediation program by Judge Daniels.

{"document": "On October 11, 2005, students from various district of California public schools filed this class action suit, in conjunction with the American Diabetes Association, in the United States District Court of the Northern District of California.  The suit was filed under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act against the California Department of Education and various school districts throughout California. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel as well as the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, asked the court for class action certification and an injunction compelling districts to provide all children with diabetes care to enable them to access education. \n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the school districts, often not having a full-time nurse on duty, were not providing appropriate care and management of diabetes for students with the disease. The students, who often cannot administer or monitor their own glucose levels, were either made to change their physician-mandated medical plans due to the schools' lack of resources, miss large amounts of class time while waiting in the office for a family member to come to school to administer an insulin shot, or to miss school due to lack of resources for monitoring blood sugar and administering insulin shots, among other consequences. The plaintiffs claim that this denies them a free and appropriate education in the least restrictive environment possible due to a physical disability, violating the above statutes. \n\nBy August 2007, the plaintiffs had reached settlement agreements with various parties and had dismissed the complaints against the defendants. A 2007 Legal Advisory of the California Department of Education states that the settlement agreement, among other things, requires California public schools to provide management of diabetes and administer insulin in accordance with the child's physician's management plan. The 2007 Legal Advisory also notes that school placement cannot be based on the unwillingness of a school to provide for a child with diabetes and that plans must be individualized. \n\nIn an offshoot of this litigation, American Nurses Assn. v. Torlakson <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12801\">(ED-CA-0009)</a>, a group of nurses challenged the 2007 Legal Advisory as in violation of state law.

The DOJ’s investigation found that CVH regularly failed to: (1) adequately protect patients from harm and undue restraints; (2) provide adequate psychiatric and psychological services; and (3) ensure adequate discharge planning and placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to each patient’s individualized needs. The report formally put CVH on notice that failure to improve conditions would result in a lawsuit.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, the Department of Justice filed suit against the state of Connecticut and its Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut for the aforementioned pattern of practices at CVH, that violated the constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA).

Thompson approved the settlement on July 8, 2009 and conditionally dismissed the suit.\n\nIn the settlement, Connecticut agreed to a wide variety of practice changes and a period of supervised operation. The state agreed to provide care and treatment “based on professional standards of practice that shall seek to: A. ameliorate symptoms such that a less restrictive locus of treatment may safely be employed; B. strengthen and support individuals’ rehabilitation and recovery; and C. enable individuals and grow and develop in ways benefiting their health and well-being.” \n\nThe settlement called for an environment that maximizes safety and is predicated on respect between the staff and those whom they serve. In addition, it mandated implementation of integrated treatment plans and interdisciplinary staff teams to increase the efficacy of treatment provided. Furthermore, the settlement outlined extensive changes in the psychiatric and psychological care provided in order to increase the safety and wellbeing of patients while also reducing the risk of harm and suicide that was extensive at CVH. Across the board, the settlement emphasized that care provided be consistent with generally accepted professional standards of care and that the environment at CVH be sufficiently humane to reduce the risk of harm. The settlement outlined a 48-month period of supervised implementation after which the agreement would terminate provided that CVH had demonstrated substantial compliance with the terms. \n\nOn September 25, 2013, the Court approved a notice of substantial compliance with certain terms of the settlement agreement and extension of termination that was filed by the State.

{"document": "On February 12, 2015, the National Association of the Deaf (NAD), on behalf of its members (including three named in the complaint) and a proposed class, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the plaintiffs sued Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the Disability Law Center, Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center, Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, the National Association of the Deaf Law and Advocacy Center, and private counsel. The plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction that would require MIT to provide accurate captioning on its online content. The plaintiffs claimed that MIT willfully violated the Rehabilitation Act and Americans with Disabilities Act by not providing captioned video and audio content on its platforms and therefore excluded deaf and hard of hearing individuals from benefiting from said content. \n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that based on information and belief, MIT did not have administrative procedures or policies in place to ensure that its online content had accurate captioning, whether or not that content had been created or produced by MIT itself. This issue extended back to 2010, when the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Education issued a joint letter to university colleges and presidents to make clear that the requirements of § 504 and ADA include technological devices when used by places of public accommodation. The following year, the Department of Education released an FAQ explaining that letter, indicating that its contents were predicated on legal precedents and that the letter would apply to all forms of emerging technology, including online content. Additionally, MIT has stated on its website how important captioning is to deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Despite all this and repeated requests from the NAD, MIT has yet to accurately caption much of its online content. \n\nAfter the initial filing of the complaint on February 12, 2015, MIT filed a motion to dismiss on May 11, 2015, citing issues of jurisdiction and a failure to state a cause of action. There were a number of responses on MIT's motion, including the filing of an Amicus Brief by a representative from the U.S. Department of Justice. While not directly involved in the case, the DOJ was an interested party and appeared to agree with the plaintiffs on this issue. On September 10, 2015, there was a hearing on the motion to dismiss held before the Magistrate Judge Katherine A. Robertson. On February 9, 2016, Judge Robertson issued a report and recommended that the motion be denied in its entirety, for reasons identical to those in the related case the NAD filed at the same time against Harvard University. <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14352\">National Association of the Deaf v.

{"document": "On May 7, 2014, a same-sex couple, who were legally married in California, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, against the state of Alabama. One plaintiff had given birth to a child, whom the other plaintiff wanted to adopt. Under Alabama law, non-biological parents may adopt their \"spouse's child.\" The plaintiffs were not considered spouses, however, because the state did not recognize same-sex marriages. As a result, their adoption petition was denied and the couple filed suit. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court to declare Alabama's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional, under the Due Process, Equal Protection, and Full Faith and Credit Clauses. They also asked for an injunction, ordering the defendants to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions and to grant the plaintiffs' adoption petition.\n\nOn June 12, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. The next day, the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama (Judge Callie V. S. Granade) found the motion to be premature. On August 20, 2014, Judge Granade adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation and granted several parties' motions to dismiss: the Alabama Attorney General was now the only defendant.\n\nOn January 23, 2015, Judge Granade granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that Alabama's same-sex marriage ban violated the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses and enjoining the state attorney general from enforcing that ban. The freedom to marry was a fundamental right, the court held, protected by the Constitution. In order for Alabama to restrict that right, its same-sex marriage ban had to be narrowly tailored and it had to serve a compelling state interest. The court rejected the state's purported interests as either not compelling or overly broad. Thus, the ban was unconstitutional. Two days later, the district court stayed its injunction until February 9, giving the defendant time to seek a further stay pending appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nOn January 28, at plaintiffs' request, Judge Granade clarified her order.  The Alabama Probate Judges Association had stated to the press that, despite the ruling, they were bound by Alabama law and could not issue same-sex marriage licenses. The Court stated that because the judgment was stayed, the Alabama probate courts were not required to follow the judgment.  However, if the stay were lifted, the U.S. Constitution would require the probate judges to issue same-sex marriage licenses, because the court's order had found that Alabama's marriage laws were unconstitutional.\n\nOn February 3, 2015, the Eleventh Circuit <i>sua sponte</i> consolidated the appeals in this case and in Strawser v. Strange (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14439\">PB-AL-0010</a> in this Clearinghouse),  and denied the Alabama Attorney General's motions for a stay pending appeal. In response, the Attorney General filed an application for a stay with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, the Circuit Justice for the Eleventh Circuit. That same day, the District Court denied plaintiffs' request to lift the stay.\n\nLate on February 8, 2015, with the district court's stay set to expire, the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Roy Moore, sent an order to probate judges and state employees, threatening them with legal action by the governor if they issued or recognized same-sex marriage licenses. The chief justice claimed that the district court orders bound only the Alabama Attorney General and his employees and not Alabama's probate judges.\n\nOn February 9, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the application for stay, with Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting from the denial. <i>Strange v. Searcy</i>, 135 S. Ct. 940 (2015). As a result, Judge Granade's orders took effect: the ban on same-sex marriage was now illegal in Alabama, at least according to the federal courts. Alabama's probate judges faced competing orders: the district court's would allow same-sex marriage, but Chief Justice Moore's would not. The result was legal chaos. Some probate judges followed the federal court order and issued same-sex marriage licenses but most probate judges refused and many ceased issuing marriage licenses entirely.\n\nIn the plaintiffs' county, Mobile County Probate Judge Don Davis refused to issue any licenses that day. Plaintiffs responded by filing a motion to hold him in contempt, which Judge Granade rejected because the probate judge was not a party to the case.\n\nThat same day the plaintiffs re-filed their adoption petition. Mobile County Probate Judge Don Davis issued an initial adoption decree but he added language saying \"that this Decree is qualified in nature, and the Court will not issue a final adoption order until a final ruling is issued in the United States Supreme Court on the Marriage Act cases before it.\" The non-biological parent brought a new lawsuit against the probate judge for including this language. Searcy v. Davis (<a href=\" http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14445\">PB-AL-0011</a> in this Clearinghouse) Probate Judge Davis eventually removed the qualified wording from the adoption petition and the court dismissed that suit.\n\nIn this case, Searcy v. Bentley, the only remaining issue involves attorneys' fees. On February 12, 2015, Judge Granade granted the plaintiffs' motion extending the time to file a petition for attorneys' fees until 30 days after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12787\">PB-OH-0003</a> in this Clearinghouse). Plaintiffs moved for attorneys' fees on August 31, 2015. The court granted the motion in part and denied it in part on May 27, 2016, awarding attorneys' fees of $126,206.66 and allowing plaintiffs to file further documentation in support of the remainder of their costs. The court additionally granted plaintiffs $500.98 in costs on June 28, 2016.

The EEOC sought injunctive relief, modification of defendants’ policies, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs. This case was originally assigned to Judge Brian Sandoval and referred to Magistrate Judge Peggy A. Leen. After Judge Sandoval resigned, the case was reassigned to Chief Judge Jones on September 16, 2009. \n\nThe EEOC claimed that because of the defendants’ actions, claimants were exposed to a hostile work environment based on being black, female, or both. Specifically, the claimants alleged that the defendants subjected them to intimidation, threats of physical force, and racial slurs by co-workers, supervisors, and third parties. When the claimants attempted to report such offenses, the defendants allegedly retaliated by issuing verbal or written warnings or suspending the women from work. \n\nOn February 15, 2007, the parties began settlement negotiations and were referred to Magistrate Judge George Foley for early neutral evaluation.

{"document": "On February 22, 2018, four Vietnamese refugees filed this habeas petition and class action lawsuit challenging U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for allegedly arbitrarily and unlawfully detaining them.\n\nIn January 2008, the United States and Vietnam entered an agreement governing the repatriation of Vietnamese nationals facing final orders of removal to Vietnam. One limit made part of the agreement was Vietnam's decision not to agree to repatriation of any national who had arrived in the United States before July 12, 1995. As a result, from 2008-2016, ICE maintained a policy of releasing Vietnamese nationals facing final orders of removal from ICE custody, given the impracticability of their deportation. However, in 2016, ICE reversed its policy, detaining Vietnamese nationals with final orders of removal indefinitely.\n\nIn the original complaint, the petitioners argued that this change in policy violated 8 U.S.C. § 1231, which prescribes a 90-day \"removal period\" in which to remove the detainee. Petitioners relied heavily upon the Supreme Court's 2001 opinion in <i>Zadvydas v. Davis</i> (533 U.S. 678), which held that Due Process precludes the United States from indefinitely detaining immigrants for whom it is not \"reasonably foreseeable\" that deportation can occur. In addition, petitioners argued that failing to provide an individualized assessment as to whether or not detention is even necessary, due to danger or flight risk, also violated 8 U.S.C. § 1231 and Due Process. Petitioners sought habeas, declaratory, and injunctive relief. Represented by Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the private law firms Reed Smith and Davis Adams, the habeas petition was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (in Santa Ana).\n\nThe petition proposed three classes of Vietnamese refugees held after receiving final orders of removal: those detained for more than 90 days (90-day class), those detained for more than 180 days (180-day class), and those detained for longer than 180 days without an individualized hearing to assess whether detention is necessary based on danger or flight risk (prolonged detention class). All class members arrived in the U.S. before 1995 and had lived in the United States as legal permanent residents (LPR) ever since. Class members faced removal proceedings after becoming involved with the criminal justice system and losing their LPR status.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge John A. Kronstadt. However, the plaintiffs in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16243\"><i>Chhoeun v. Marin</i></a>, a case challenging ICE's detention of Cambodian refugees stripped of their legal permanent resident status due to criminal convictions, moved to relate this case to that one. On March 14, 2018, the motion was granted, and both cases were assigned to Judge Cormac J. Carney.\n\nOn April 25, 2018, the petitioners moved for a preliminary injunction to secure the release of the named defendants. However, soon thereafter, ICE released them from detention, mooting the motion. At this point, the government moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that its claims were now moot. Petitioners responded by filing an amended complaint, acknowledging that the original named petitioners had been released from ICE custody and adding new named petitioners who were in ICE detention at the time of filing.\n\nIn light of the amended complaint, Judge Cormac J. Carney dismissed the motion for a preliminary injunction on May 23, 2018, simply noting that the injunction was superseded by the new complaint and that the need for release no longer applied to the named petitioners in the original complaint. 2018 WL 3357577.\n\nJudge Carney denied the government’s motion to dismiss on September 6, 2018. 333 F. Supp. 3d 984. The court held that the petitioners' claims were not moot because, although the named petitioners were released from detention, they could still be re-detained at any time and therefore still had a live habeas relief interest. The court also held that the petitioners had successfully pleaded claims upon which relief could be granted as to their assertions that their post-removal order detention was unlawful when removal was not likely in the foreseeable future and that detentions over six months without individualized bond hearings are unlawful.\n\nOn October 18, 2018, Judge Carney granted in part and denied in part class certification, granting certification to the 90-day and 180-day classes only as to the declaratory \"issues of whether the Class has overcome the six month presumption of reasonableness and met its burden under <i>Zadvydas</i> [<i>v. Davis</i> (533 U.S. 678)],\" declining to certify on the injunctive issue that would have limited the government's authority to detain immigrants past 180 days. The court furthermore certified the prolonged detention class, seeking injunctive relief to compel bond hearings for the detainees. 2018 WL 11184556.\n\nAfter a year and a half of discovery, the petitioners moved for summary judgment on March 6, 2020, and the government cross-filed a month later on April 10. On June 11, 2020, the government's motion was granted in substantial part, settling all of the declaratory issues in favor of the government. Judge Carney's opinion repeatedly noted the validity of the petitioners' arguments, writing that \"many class members may be able to show that there is 'good reason to believe' their removal is unlikely\" but concluded that sweeping declarations as such would be inappropriate where individualized, fact-intensive review is the norm, noting that <i>Zadvydas</i> claims are usually made in individual habeas hearings.\n\nFollowing this ruling, the petitioners moved to reconsider but then withdrew their motion. From there, the case went silent until May 5, 2021 when Judge Carney ordered the parties to show cause as to why the case should not be dismissed and closed. The petitioners have since responded to that order; however the contents of their response have been sealed for reasons unknown. It is unclear how the change from the Trump presidential administration to the Biden administration has affected this case.

Judge Cormac J. Carney certified three classes of Vietnamese immigrants held in ICE detention in 2018 but subsequently dismissed their claims for declaratory relief in 2020 on the basis that it was inappropriate to grant sweeping declarations where individual review is required.

{"document": "On September 21, 2011, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed this  lawsuit against Bass Pro Outdoor World in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiff brought the lawsuit for alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Specifically, the EEOC alleged that since November of 2005 Bass Pro engaged in a nationwide pattern or practice of denying employment to qualified Black and Hispanic applicants for hourly and salaried positions and that it retaliated against employees who opposed actions they perceived as unlawful or who otherwise complained or reported such incidents (including but not limited to sexual harassment and gender discrimination). The EEOC also alleged that Bass Pro destroyed or failed to preserve relevant records in violation of Section 709(c) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-8(c), such as employment applications, personnel files, tests, lists of job candidates, and efforts to contact the corporate complaint center. The EEOC sought back pay, economic compensation, compensation for emotional suffering, punitive damages, and reinstatement of behalf of those affected. It also sought injunctions to end the allegedly discriminatory and retaliatory practices and to create and preserve records in compliance with the Civil Rights Act. Unusually, for the EEOC, the lawsuit was based on a \"Commissioner's Charge\" rather than a complaint by an employee. The case was assigned to Judge Keith Ellison.\n\nBass Pro responded to the EEOC's 9-page complaint on January 5, 2012 with a motion to dismiss complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On January 26, 2012, the EEOC filed a 12-page amended complaint giving more factual detail for its allegations, such as statistics on the number of Black and Hispanic managers and another instance of retaliation. In this complaint the EEOC also added Bass Pro, Inc. (BPI), and Tracker Marine, LLC (Tracker), as defendants. Because the EEOC had filed a new complaint, Judge Ellison denied Bass Pro's motion to dismiss the original complaint as moot. On March 5, 2012, Bass Pro filed a new motion to dismiss seeking, among other things, not only dismissal of all claims based on a failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, but also to have the claims against Tracker and Bass Pro, Inc. dismissed on jurisdictional and procedural grounds.\n\nOn May 31, 2012, the court granted Bass Pro's motion in part, giving the EEOC leave to amend the complaint. 884 F.Supp.2d 499 (S.D. Tex. 2012). The court found that the EEOC had made sufficient allegations to state the recordkeeping claim.  Because the EEOC had not identified even one particular individual for its retaliation claim, that claim was dismissed with leave to amend. The court ruled that the 300-day limitation (barring suits for conduct that occurred more than 300 days before a charge is filed with the EEOC) applied to both claims under § 706 and claims under § 707 (pattern or practice). The court also ruled that the EEOC could not proceed on a hybrid § 706 and § 707 claim--pattern or practice claims could not be brought under § 706, and the EEOC had to provide sufficient allegations for each type of claim. For those reasons the court restricted the EEOC's claims to those that fell within February 2007 and April 2010 and dismissed the EEOC's discriminatory hiring claims because the statistics on managers did not plausibly suggest a pattern or practice of hiring discrimination for the wider category of salaried and hourly positions, as opposed to just manager positions.\n\nThe EEOC filed a 247-page second amended complaint on July 20, 2012. The complaint greatly elaborated the factual details of the claims. The most notable additions were as follows: connecting the behavior of store lower-level management to a profile allegedly established by the owner of the companies at a meeting of Store General Managers, listing a total of 201 individuals (184 Black and 18 Hispanic) covering a range of states who were denied employment with details of their application efforts, identifying 5 targets of retaliation and narrating their attempts to complain about or correct unlawful activity, and providing statistic data from 24 stores across the country on the number of total Black and Hispanic employees as well as store-specific comparisons of percentages of Black and Hispanic Bass Pro employees to the percentage of Black and Hispanic employees in the county respectively (the comparisons involved manager and non-manager positions). The complaint did not explicitly differentiate §706 claims from §707 claims. The complaint also addressed jurisdictional issues.\n\nBass Pro filed another motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on August 24, 2012. On October 25, 2012, the court dismissed the claims against BPI for lack of jurisdiction but deferred deciding jurisdiction over Tracker because Bass Pro had misidentified Tracker Marine Retail, LLC, as Tracker Marine and the EEOC hadn't had a full opportunity for discovery to establish jurisdiction. 2012 WL 13040407.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, the court granted Bass Pro's motion to dismiss in part, with leave to amend. Noting that the allegations did not constitute a prima facie case of discriminatory hiring under § 706, the court found them sufficient to state the claim. The court held the combination of statistics and anecdotes to be sufficient to state a §707 pattern or practice claim. The court dismissed retaliation claims for 2 of the 5 individuals. The record-keeping claim was still valid. 2013 WL 1124063.\n\nThe EEOC filed a third amended complaint on April 15, 2013 adding details for the retaliation claims that had been dismissed. On May 15, 2013, Bass Pro filed its response and a motion for summary judgment. The EEOC subsequently filed a motion for partial summary in its own favor, arguing that it had satisfied its duty to engage in conciliation before bringing a suit and that the court should not rule on that issue. On October 2, 2013, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment, holding that the issue was reviewable. 2013 WL 5515345.\n\nOn June 13, 2014, the EEOC filed its fourth amended complaint, correcting the name of one of the defendants. Because this was the only change, the parties agreed that the fourth amended complaint did not render Bass Pro’s motion for summary judgment moot. On July 30, 2014, the court denied this motion, reconsidering its denial of the EEOC’s motion for summary judgment and finding that the EEOC did meet the statutory requirements of conciliation. 35 F.Supp.3d 836. On November 17, 2014, the court allowed Bass Pro to file an interlocutory appeal. 2014 WL 6453606. Bass Pro appealed the July 30 order to the U.S. Appellate Court for the Fifth Circuit on February 10, 2015. The district court chose not to stay discovery pending the appeal.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision to deny Bass Pro’s motion for summary judgment. 826 F.3d 791. The panel was made up of Judge Patrick Higginbotham, Judge Stephen Higginson, and Judge Leslie Southwick.\n\nOn July 24, 2017, the parties reached a settlement agreement, and the court entered a consent decree the next day. The consent decree required Bass Pro to reform its recruitment and hiring practices, provide anti-discrimination training, create an Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and pay a total of $10,500,000.00 to be distributed among the qualified Black and Hispanic applicants who had been denied employment at any of its stores nationwide. Pro Bass also had to report back to the EEOC. The consent decree was to be in effect for forty-two months (or three and a half years) after its date of entry, during which the court would retain jurisdiction.\n\nIn September 2017, the court granted a motion to extend the deadlines for Bass Pro having to complete certain tasks. As of April 20, 2020, there are no further entries in the docket since then, which suggests that the parties have been compliant with the consent decree so far. The court will presumably continue to retain jurisdiction until January 2021, when the consent decree expires.\n", "summary": "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit against Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC, for alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Specifically, the EEOC alleged that since November of 2005 Bass Pro engaged in a nationwide pattern or practice of denying employment to qualified black and Hispanic applicants and that it retaliated against employees who opposed actions they perceived as unlawful. The case settled in July 2017. Bass Pro paid a total of $10.5 million in damages to be distributed among qualified Black and Hispanic applicants who were denied employment between February 2007 and April 2010.

{"document": "On October 15, 2008, African-American employees at the freight transportation company Yellow Transportation, Inc. (\"Yellow\") filed a class action lawsuit against their employer in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981. The plaintiffs, represented by an attorney from the Edwin F. Mandel Legal Aid Clinic and private counsel, sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief as well as class certification. They alleged that Yellow created a racially hostile work environment for African-American employees working at Yellow's facility in Chicago Ridge, IL, from October 15, 2004 to the present. They also claimed that Yellow subjected those employees to disparate treatment and retaliated against them when they complained about the discriminatory practice. The named plaintiffs also brought their individual claims against the employer.\n\nThe parties started the discovery process with regard to the issue of class certification. During March and June 2009, Yellow served 19 subpoenas on the plaintiffs' former employers, requesting various information regarding their previous employment. Yellow claimed that some of the plaintiffs failed to disclose their claims against it in their filings of bankruptcy proceedings despite their knowledge of the claims, and that some failed to disclose criminal convictions on their job applications with Yellow. The plaintiffs moved to quash subpoenas and for protective order. The District Court (Magistrate Judge Nan R. Nolan) granted the plaintiffs' motion on October 9. 2009. 2009 WL 3270791 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 9, 2009). Yellow then moved for leave to amend its answer and add the affirmative defenses of judicial estoppel and after-acquired evidence. The Court (Judge Joan B. Gottschall) granted the motion on January 14, 2010. 2010 WL 152000 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 14, 2010). \n\nIn the meantime, in or about March 2009, YRC, Inc. (\"YRC\"), Yellow's parent company, merged Yellow with another YRC company, Roadway Express, Inc. (\"Roadway\"). In December 2009, the plaintiffs and the proposed class who were still on the job were transferred to a former Roadway facility in Chicago Heights, IL. In the same month, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") started its own lawsuit against Yellow and YRC, <i>EEOC v. Yellow Transportation, Inc. and YRC, Inc.</i>, linked below as a related case (Clearinghouse code: EE-IL-0330). It was filed in the same district court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., and the plaintiffs in this case later joined that one, too, as intervenor plaintiffs. \n\nBack in this case, on April 12, 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding YRC as a co-defendant and an individual as a named plaintiff. They also redefined the hostile work environment class to include individuals working at both the Chicago Ridge and Chicago Heights facilities. This modification was in light of a then ongoing case filed by the EEOC originally against Roadway <i>EEOC v. Roadway Express, Inc.</i>, linked below (Clearinghouse code: EE-IL-0189). The action was brought on behalf of African-American employees working at the Roadway facility in Chicago Heights for race discrimination.\n\nYellow opposed to this last change, arguing that the class definition was too broad. The plaintiffs then moved to withdraw the amended complaint and to file a new one, with a hostile work environment class including only former Chicago Ridge employees. The Court (Magistrate Judge Nolan) granted the motion on July 26, 2010, reasoning that it was not clear yet to the Court that both Yellow and Roadway employees were complaining of the same events. Brown v. Yellow Transp., Inc., 08 C 5908, 2010 WL 2911786 (N.D. Ill. July 26, 2010). The corrected amended complaint was filed the next day. \n\nSubsequently, the plaintiffs moved to certify class and the defendants filed their opposition. On May 11, 2011, the Court (Judge Gottschall) granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify the class. 2011 WL 1838741 (N.D. Ill. May 11, 2011). The defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal to the appellate court, but it was denied on July 1, 2011. \n\nOn June 27, 2012, the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Susan E. Cox, upon both parties' consent, for settlement proceedings. Negotiations were successful, and this Brown case and the EEOC case were consolidated for the purpose of a consent decree, which Magistrate Judge Cox signed on September 25, 2012.\n\nIn the decree, the defendants agreed to pay $11,000,000 to the plaintiff class; the EEOC was placed in charge of allocating the award to eligible individuals. No injunction was issued, since the Chicago Ridge facility was closed and the Chicago Heights facility was already subject to a consent decree issued in <i>EEOC v.

{"document": "On January 16, 2007, two recipients of federal benefits under the Section 8 Housing Voucher Program and a non-profit advocacy organization filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiff sued the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The case was assigned to Judge George H. Wu. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, claimed that the Authority had violated due process by altering housing benefits to voucher recipients without adequate notice. The plaintiff claimed that HACLA violated six due process and federal regulations by failing to provide proper notice of Section 8 rent increases, which would affect approximately 22,000 tenants receiving federal benefits.\n\nThe Section 8 Housing Voucher Program was designed to aid low-income families in acquiring housing by subsidizing private landlords who rented to low-income tenants. In 2004, the defendant proposed cutting back on these federal subsidies in order to meet a federally-set budget. The changes were announced publicly, and would not take effect until April 2005. Individual tenants would not be subject to new regulations until their next annual evaluation, unless they moved before that time.\n\nIn November 2007, the court granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss. 2007 WL 9658205.

On remand, the district court granted HACLA’s renewed motion for summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit again reversed, holding that the flyer sent by HACLA did not provide sufficient notice of the voucher program change.  Specifically, the court held that this “failure violated both the requirements of the Voucher Program and regulations and the requirements of procedural due process.” 806 F. 3d 1178. The matter was remanded but included instructions to the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the matters of federal and state law at issue on appeal. \n\nIn November 2015, HACLA petitioned the Ninth Circuit for rehearing en banc which the court denied in January 2016. 806 F. 3d 1178. HACLA subsequently petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari which was denied in October 2016. 137 S.Ct. 52.  \n\nFollowing remand, the court certified two classes: (1) an injunctive relief class and (2) a damages class. The Injunctive Relief Class consisted of all Section 8 voucher recipients whose benefits were administered by HACLA and who in the past received, or in the future may receive, notice of decreased benefits. The Damages Class consisted of HACLA Section 8 tenants, between June 1, 2005 and September 30, 2006, whose rental contribution was greater than it would have been if not for HACLA’s 2004 decrease in benefits.

{"document": "This lawsuit, filed by the General Assembly of Tennessee \"General Assembly,\" a state senator, and state representative on their own behalf and on additionally on the behalf of the state of Tennessee, challenged the U.S. Department of State's (DOS) ability to use state funds to resettle refugees within the United States through the Refugee Act (\"the Act\") and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (\"ORR\") within the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"). On March 13, 2017, the General Assembly Tennessee filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that provisions of the Refugee Resettlement Act (\"the Act\") and Refugee Medical Assistance Program violated the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment through enacting and implementing certain statutes that require states to provide Medicaid coverage to eligible refugees. \n\nThe General Assembly argued that the intent behind the Act was to avoid taxing states for what was ultimately a federal effort. Since the Act's passage in 1980, the General Assembly of Tennessee alleged that the burden on states to fund the program had increased. Moreover, the complaint argued, the state was further burdened by a requirement to cover medical costs for refugees until the state of Tennessee itself determines that a refugee is ineligible for the state Medicaid program. The state of Tennessee withdrew its participation from the refugee resettlement program in 2007. The complaint argued that the federal government nevertheless \"coerced the state to continue funding\" the program by threatening to withdraw federal Medicaid funding, which would amount to a 20% loss of its budget. The complaint further asserted that in establishing a private agency, Catholic Charities of Tennessee, to assume control and of the program in the state, \"the federal government nullified the decision of the people of Tennessee to withdraw from an ostensibly voluntary federal program and thereby commandeered state funds to support a federal initiative.\"\n\nThe case was reassigned to Judge S. Thomas Anderson on March 24, 2017.\n\nDOS moved to dismiss the case on June 1, 2017. DOS argued that \"the refugee-coverage provision does not compel States to expend Medicaid funds for refugees; it conserves State funds by limiting to seven years the obligation the States would otherwise incur, under the Equal Protection Clause, to provide coverage to refugees on the same terms as they do U.S. citizens.\" \n\nMeanwhile, on June 2, 2017, the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, Bridge Refugees Services, and the Nashville Intentional Center for Empowerment moved to intervene as defendants. Both the General Assembly and DOS filed responses in opposition to that motion to intervene. \n\nOn March 19, 2018, Judge Anderson granted DOS's motion to dismiss for lack of standing on the alleged injury. 329 F.Supp.3d 597, 2018 WL 1386845. The General Assembly of Tennessee failed to establish that it has the authority on behalf of the state of Tennessee. The court also denied the intervenors' motions as moot. In his opinion, Judge Anderson held, first, that the Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. The General Assembly of Tennessee, specifically its legislators, legislature, and Attorney General, lacked standing. The claim was not ripe because the federal government had not yet denied Medicaid funds to Tennessee and no such enforcement was imminent. Further, the Medicaid Act, which required an administrative process followed by appellate court review, precluded the claim from review in a district court.\n\nNext, Judge Anderson held that the General Assembly of Tennessee had failed to state a claim for relief under the Spending Clause or Tenth Amendment. Congress had broad powers over immigration and naturalization, including refugees' eligibility for participation in federal benefits programs. Congress had, thus, acted within its authority to set funding conditions for the States in the relevant statutes. These conditions were neither coercive nor new. The federal government had not threatened to deny funding to Tennessee. The State had, for over four decades, accepted federal Medicaid funds on the condition that it had to cover lawfully-present noncitizens, so the requirement to provide state funding for refugees in exchange for federal Medicaid funds was not a new condition. Nor should the General Assembly of Tennessee be surprised by recent fluctuations in the number of admitted refugees -- a recurring situation that the Refugee Act of 1980 anticipates.\n\nOn May 10, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Sixth Circuit, docket #18-5478, regarding the March 19, 2018 judgement dismissing the case and denying the motion to intervene as moot.\n\nOn July 24th, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s decision stating that the General Assembly was without subject-matter jurisdiction, 931 F.3d 499, 2019 WL 3310332. The Sixth Circuit held that the General Assembly had not identified an injury that it suffered, such as disruption of the legislative process, a usurpation of its authority, or nullification of anything it has done. The lower court's decision that the General Assembly was without standing to bring a case was affirmed on the basis that an alleged injury was insufficient. Therefore, the individual legislators' standing was also denied. Finally, the General Assembly did not have the authority to bring a suit in the name of the state of Tennessee. \n\nThe case was closed October 24, 2019.", "summary": "This lawsuit, brought by the General Assembly of Tennessee in their own interests and on behalf of the state of Tennessee, challenged DOS's ability to use state funds to resettle refugees within the U.S.  Tennessee maintained that provisions of the Refugee Resettlement Act and Refugee Medical Assistance Program violated the Spending Clause and 10th Amendment.

The case was assigned to District Judge Sarah Evans Barker. The plaintiff sued the Secretary of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (“the agency”) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff, represented by the ACLU of Indiana and the Health and Human Rights Clinic at Indiana University’s McKinney School of Law, sought injunctive and monetary relief, claiming violation of federal Medicaid law. \n\nThe plaintiff alleged that the Agency had a formal policy of denying Medicaid recipients with Hepatitis C “medically necessary” drugs. Specifically, they alleged that the agency denied Medicaid recipients with Hepatitis C direct-acting antiviral medications (specifically Harvoni) unless and until absolutely necessary. Despite these practices, medical professional agreed that  early administration of the medication was “medically necessary” to prevent liver damage and other serious conditions. \n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on January 15, 2016. They alleged that the plaintiff had failed to state claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for which relief could be granted. On April 12, 2016, Judge Barker denied defendants’ motion. She held that the plaintiff had sufficiently pled a claim, so she denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. \n\nThe original plaintiff was provided with Harvoni by the agency, and consequently a new plaintiff intervened in the suit on January 3, 2017. Discovery and negotiations lasted through the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. On November 8, 2018, the parties settled the case. The settlement, contingent on the Court’s certification of the class, involved injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees for the plaintiff. As part of the settlement, the agency agreed to eliminate its policy of restricting Medicaid reimbursement for Harvoni to only those Medicaid recipients with advanced Hepatitis C or those who were co-infected with HIV or AIDS or were post-liver transplant. The defendants had to implement this policy by July 1, 2019. The defendants also agreed that they would pay the plaintiffs’ counsel $117,500 in attorneys’ fees. The agreement stated that the plaintiffs could enforce it through a breach of contract claim - meaning that the Court did not maintain jurisdiction to enforce it. \n\nJudge Barker approved class-certification on November 9, 2018. The Court defined the certified class as:\n\nAny and all adult Medicaid recipients in Indiana, current and future, with a diagnosis of chronic Hepatitis C, genotype 1, who have been prescribed one of the direct-acting antiviral medications enumerated in the 2016 Policy or 2018 Policy, by or in consultation with an Infectious Disease or GI specialist, but do not meet the medical requirements of such policy to receive Medicaid reimbursement for that prescribed medication. \n\nOn November 26, 2018, Judge Barker approved the parties’ joint motion regarding the manner and form of notice to the class.

The EEOC sought injunctive relief and back pay on behalf of Hannabery employees alleging that the defendant violated the ADEA by subjecting older workers to disparate terms and conditions of employment, including discharge, loss of raises, benefits and bonuses, negative performance evaluations, and excess scrutiny of their job performances.

{"document": "On March 9, 2016, the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights (GLAHR) and students within the University System of Georgia filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The plaintiffs sued the members of the Board of Regents for the University System of Georgia for denying in-state tuition to undocumented students who had received deferred immigration action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. They argued that the students were lawful residents of Georgia and that, as such, the state had created an unconstitutional two-tiered residency classification system. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and monetary relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming violations of the Supremacy Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. \n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on April 7, 2016. They argued that GLAHR lacked standing; the plaintiff’s official capacity claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and the defendants had qualified immunity. In response, the plaintiffs amended their complaint on April 21, 2016, adding both plaintiffs and defendants to the lawsuit and maintaining their original causes of action. They also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on May 3, 2016, seeking enjoinment of the University System’s classification system that had been classifying deferred action recipients as not lawfully present. The plaintiffs alleged that this system was irreparably harming the educational opportunities and career prospects of the deferred action students. The defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint two days later. Judge William C. O’Kelley heard oral arguments regarding the motion to dismiss on August 25, 2016. \n\nOn February 10, 2017, defendants motioned to stay proceedings given a parallel proceeding in <i>Dean Alford v. Rigoberto Rivera Hernandez</i>. In that case, plaintiffs brought suit in state court against the University System of Georgia Board of Regents, arguing their denial of in-state tuition to DACA recipients violated the Board of Regents’ own policies and state statutory law concerning residency status. As that case had moved to the Georgia Supreme Court, defendants argued proceedings in this case should be stayed pending the outcome of that case. \n\nOn February 16, 2017, Judge William C. O’Kelley granted defendant’s motion to stay proceedings and denied without prejudice the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction and the defendants’ motion to dismiss. He explained both the parallel litigation in <i>Dean Alford v. Rigoberto Rivera Hernandez</i> and President Trump’s stated opposition to the DACA program justified the stay. \n\nFollowing the stay, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint on May 1, 2017. The plaintiffs filed another motion for a preliminary injunction on May 31, 2017. Defendants responded in opposition on June 13, 2017. \n\nSubsequent to Judge O’Kelley’s decision, the Trump Administration announced its decision to rescind the DACA program. \n\nOn March 28, 2018, the District Court dismissed without prejudice the defendants’ motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court stayed the case pending a decision from the Eleventh Circuit in <i>Estrada v. Becker</i>. In <i>Estrada</i>, students qualified to attend Georgia’s selective schools challenged the Georgia Board of Regents’ policy requiring Georgia’s three most selective universities to verify the “lawful presence” of students admitted. Under the challenged policy, applicants with DACA could not attend schools that did not admit all academically qualified applicants for the two most recent years. The District Court in <i>Estrada</i> had dismissed plaintiffs’ challenges that the policy violated the Supremacy Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nOn March 6, 2019, the Eleventh Circuit issued its decision in <i>Estrada</i> and affirmed the District Court. 917 F.3d 1298. It found the policy did not violate the Supremacy Clause because it was not an unconstitutional regulation of immigration and the policy was not preempted. Regarding the Equal Protection claim, it agreed with the District Court that the students were not similarly situated to other noncitizens permitted to attend because unlike the other noncitizens the DACA recipients did not have lawful status. Following the decision in <i>Estrada</i>, Judge Richard W. Story issued an order to show cause on March 12, 2019, asking the plaintiffs to demonstrate why <i>GLAHR v.

Represented by the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs and the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, the plaintiff alleged that Wal-Mart had intentionally deprived her of employment-based spousal health insurance benefits because the plaintiff and her wife were the same sex. This, she alleged, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal Equal Pay Act, and the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Law. The plaintiff sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, as well as class certification.\n\nThis case was assigned to District Judge William G. Young. Discovery and settlement negotiations proceeded, and were successful: in December 2016, the parties proposed a class-wide settlement.\n\nThe class was specified as all current and former Walmart employees who were married to “legal same-sex spouse” between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013, would have been eligible to receive spousal health insurance benefits from Wal-Mart if they had been married to a person of the opposite sex, but did not receive those benefits.\n \nThe remedy included a payment of $7.5 million—which covered reasonable attorneys fees to be determined by the Court (but not to exceed $1.875 million), a $25,000 “service payment” to the named plaintiff, all notice and administrative costs of the settlement (not to exceed $110,000), and damages paid to class members. Class members were able to submit proof of actual medical expenses, which received priority.  Whatever money was left after those were paid was to be distributed pro rata to all the other class members, with a cap of $5,000 per year for each class member. The settlement agreement set up a claims process to manage the distribution of these funds. Class members had the ability to “opt out” of the settlement, in which case they would receive no money, but retain their right to sue separately.\n \nIn addition, the settlement had a paragraph on “programmatic relief,” in which Wal-Mart “commit[ed] to treating same-sex and opposite-sex spouses or couples equally in the provision of health insurance benefits, so long as to do so is consistent with applicable law.”\n\nOn December 16, 2016, Judge Young granted the parties’ motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. Wal-Mart was required to notify the members of the class and to give them the chance to object to the settlement if they chose to do so. \n\nThe fairness hearing took place on May 15, 2017. Judge Young issued a final order approving the settlement the following day. He approved Plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees, and awarded counsel $1.875 million in fees and $25,285.04 in litigation expenses. \n\nThe court retained jurisdiction over the case either for a period of six months after the Settlement Effective Date, or for a period of one month after all Settlement Class Members received their final payments and any remaining funds had been distributed cypres--whichever was longer. \n\nAs of March 2019, nearly two years after the settlement agreement was entered, there has been no further litigation.

The plaintiffs sued the Governor of New York, the New York State Office of Mental Health, Commissioner, Associate Commissioner, and the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (\"DOCCS\"), alleging that the defendants failed to make available community-based housing and supportive services that the plaintiffs require upon release. As a result, plaintiffs were allegedly held in state prison past their lawful release dates (in some cases over a year). The plaintiffs also alleged that during this prolonged time in prison, the defendants subjected them to solitary confinement and even revoked the approved release status of the inmates in response to the inmates' reporting of violations.\n\nThe plaintiffs sued under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C § 794, and 42 U.S.C. §1983 for violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Represented by the Legal Aid Society and Disability Rights New York, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief for the alleged unconstitutional and discriminatory practices to which the defendants subjected them.

Claiming that the patrol officers were stopping vehicles solely due to the race/ethnicity of the occupants, Plaintiffs asserted that their Fourth Amendment rights were being violated, and that the officers were acting in excess of their authority under 8 U.S.C. §1357 and 8 C.F.R. §287.8(b)(2) (generally requiring officers to have a reasonable suspicion that an occupant of the vehicle is illegally present in the United States in order to stop the vehicle).  \n\nThe Plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Washington and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NIRP), asked the court for both declaratory and injunctive relief.  Specifically, Plaintiffs requested that patrol officers be trained on what \"reasonable suspicion\" entails, and that the patrol office keep complete and accurate records of officer training and testing, as well as every vehicle stop.

{"document": "On September 9, 2008, in response to charges filed by 18 women, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed this lawsuit against Sterling Jewelers, alleging violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 based on discriminatory employment practices. Specifically, the EEOC claimed that Sterling Jewelers intentionally discriminated against female sales employees by maintaining a system of excessively subjective promotion and compensation decisions and thereby permitting or encouraging managers to deny equal access to promotion and compensation to female employees. The EEOC claimed in the alternative that Sterling Jewelers maintained an excessively subjective system that had an illegal disparate impact on female retail sales employees. The EEOC sought injunctive and monetary relief, including back pay, promotion, compensation for lost benefits and emotional suffering, and development of policies and programs to provide equal opportunities to women and eliminate the effects of past discrimination. The EEOC also sought to recoup the cost of its litigation. The litigation was brought on behalf of the 18 charging parties and all other similarly situated female employees.\n\nThe progress of the case has been slow because of numerous disputes over procedure and discovery.\n\nOn January 6, 2010, the Court (Judge Richard J. Arcara) denied Sterling's motion to dismiss all claims for conduct preceding the statute of limitations period for the first party to file charges with the EEOC, holding that the EEOC was not bound by the statute of limitations, which applied only to individuals. 2010 WL 86376 (W.D.N.Y. 2010)\n\nOn July 15, 2010, the Court (Magistrate Judge Jeremiah J. McCarthy), among other things, allowed the charging parties to intervene in the proceedings to participate in argument over the scope of a protective order. 2010 WL 2803017 (W.D.N.Y. 2010). For contractual reasons the charging parties were pursuing their claims separately in a class-action arbitration and wanted to be able to receive discovery information from the EEOC, though they were prohibited from sharing information with the EEOC. See <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11066\">Jock v. Sterling Jewelers, Inc.</a>.

Arcara) bifurcated the trial and discovery into two phases, liability (Stage I) and damages (Stage II). Stage I generally covered the issue of whether there was a disparate impact on female retail employees at Sterling to establish a pattern or practice of discrimination, while Stage II would occur only if the EEOC prevailed at phase I and covered the individual aspects of each employee's case along with whether there was a legitimate business reason for the disparity. The EEOC sought to have the punitive damages determination included in phase I, but the Court rejected that approach. 788 F.Supp.2d 83 (W.D.N.Y. 2011).\n\nThe bifurcation was followed by extensive discovery disputes from 2011 to 2012. \n\nOn September 25, 2013, Sterling moved for partial summary judgment on the grounds that the EEOC failed to satisfy its obligation to conduct an adequate, nationwide investigation of Sterling's employment practices. To this, the EEOC stated that courts need not inquire into the sufficiency of the investigation itself.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, the Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation, which granted in part and denied in part the motion for summary judgment. The court granted partial summary judgment on the claim that the EEOC failed to prove that it satisfied its statutory obligation to conduct a pre-suit investigation, and it denied Sterling’s motion to strike portions of the EEOC’s Statement of Facts for the reason that it contained “statement[s] that rely on an admissible evidence not in the record, as well as legal argument and generalized conclusory statements.” 3 F.Supp.3d 57\n\nOn May 15, 2014, the EEOC filed an appeal, arguing that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because the magistrate judge improperly reviewed the sufficiency of the EEOC's investigation, rather than whether there was an investigation or not.\n\nThe Second Circuit Court of Appeals agreed and decided on September 9, 2015, to vacate the district court's summary judgment order, thus remanding the case for further proceedings. 801 F.3d 96\n\nOn May 4, 2017, the EEOC and Sterling entered into a consent decree. The court maintained jurisdiction for a period of three years and three months. Provisions included enjoining Sterling's conduct, the appointment of an employment practice expert to oversee and recommend changes within Sterling, training, and further additional internal procedures for implementing equal employment practices. While there was no award of attorney's fees, Sterling agreed to bear all expenses that it would incur to implement the provisions of the consent decree.\n\nIn 2018, a dispute arose between Sterling and the EEOC regarding Sterling's rejection of a merit pay program that the EEOC had proposed pursuant to the consent decree. The EEOC claimed that Sterling had not provided a legitimate business reason for rejecting the proposal. The parties submitted the issue to Fred Alvarez through their mutually agreed upon dispute resolution mechanism. Mr. Alvarez issued a decision on June 19, 2019, holding that Sterling had not demonstrated that its alternative merit pay program would be less adversely impactful to their female retail sales employees than the EEOC's proposal. \n\nAfter the EEOC sought relief from Sterling, the parties agreed to extend the term of the decree for 15 months until November of 2021 in order to verify Sterling's implementation of the new merit pay compensation program.

The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Internal Revenue Service. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for a declaratory injunction that the contraceptive services mandate violated the above statutes. The plaintiffs also requested a declaratory judgment that the mandate is generally invalid, a permanent injunction against HHS, Treasury, and the IRS from enforcing the mandate against the Feltls and their company, and a declaratory judgment that group health plans excluding contraception do not violated the Affordable Care Act. The plaintiffs further requested reasonable attorneys fees and a jury trial.\n\nThis lawsuit claims that the contraceptive services mandate was improperly promulgated under the Administrative Procedures Act, and that being required to provide a health plan to their employees that includes contraceptive services violates the Feltls' freedom of religion and First and Fifth Amendment rights.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This lawsuit was filed on behalf on an unaccompanied minor subject to deportation, alleging that the Trump administrations' system of authorizing the summary removal of persons to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 bypassed procedural protections otherwise granted to minor children. On June 24, the court granted a TRO. On June 29, the defendants notified the court that they have exempted the plaintiff from processing under Title 42. On August 6, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case. <hr>\n\nOn June 9, 2020, a 16-year-old migrant filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP Office of Field Operations, U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, against the Trump administration’s system which authorizes deportation from the United States even without any signs of COVID-19. The plaintiff brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from enforcing the order under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, the Public Health Services Act of 1944, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the new system for restricting immigration along the borders (collectively referred to as “Title 42 Process”) which authorizes the summary removal of unaccompanied children without any due process is an unlawful invocation of Title 42 of the U.S. Code. The plaintiff was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation Immigrants Rights Project, ACLU District of Columbia, ACLU Texas, Oxfam America, and the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies. The case was assigned to Judge Carl K. Nichols. \n\nOn May 19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/order-suspending-introduction-certain-persons.html\">issued an order</a> suspending “the introduction into the United States of persons from designated foreign countries or places” to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 under 42 U.S.C. § 265 (Title 42). The CDC interpreted the authority expansively to cover not only those entering the U.S but also those who have already crossed the border. The Title 42 Process was amended on May 20 to take effect indefinitely until the CDC determined it was no longer necessary. \n\nThe plaintiff, an unaccompanied minor, fled persecution from Honduras and was apprehended by CBP upon entry. Under the Title 42 Process, he was subject to summary expulsion and was scheduled to be deported to Honduras on June 10. The plaintiff alleged that the Title 42 Process bypassed statutory and procedural protections otherwise granted to unaccompanied minor children. While the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) already authorized the rapid removal of noncitizens who entered the U.S. illegally, unaccompanied children were not subject to expedited removal unlike the May 19 order which did not exempt minors. Prior to implementation of the Title 42 Process, the plaintiff would have been entitled to a full hearing and appeals process to determine his right to remain in the U.S. The plaintiff also alleged that while the Title 42 Process authorized the defendant for testing and quarantine as a health directive, the expulsion of children seeking protection from persecution violated the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. \n\nThe plaintiff also filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) staying his expulsion scheduled for June 10, pending the hearing on the authority of Title 42. The plaintiff also sought an order staying his expulsion under the protection of the INA and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\n\nThe same day the complaint was filed, the parties agreed that the government will not move the plaintiff until June 10. On June 10, a hearing was held regarding the TRO. On June 15, an amicus brief was submitted by the International Refugee Assistance Project in support of the plaintiff’s emergency TRO motion. On June 17, the defendants submitted an opposition to the TRO, contending that public health concerns justified the CDC order. The following day, the Scholars or Refugee and Immigration Law sought to submit an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff. \n\nOn June 24, the TRO was granted pending the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. \n\nOn June 29, the defendants notified the court that they had transferred the custody of the plaintiff to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Department of Health and Human Services, for immigration processing under Title 8 of the U.S. Code, which exempted the plaintiff from processing under Title 42. The defendants argued that since the plaintiff would no longer be subject to the challenged CDC Order, the case was moot. \n\nOn July 2, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding another minor child as an additional plaintiff. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on July 23, arguing lack of jurisdiction. They argued that the case is moot, since both plaintiffs are now excepted from the order, and therefore, there is no actual ongoing controversy. \n\nOn August 6, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a lawsuit brought by Harvard and MIT regarding the July 2020 release of ICE regulations which, in effect, meant that students on F-1 visas would risk deportation if their school shifted to online learning. On July 14, the parties informed the court that the government agreed to rescind the July 6 directive, as well as the associated FAQ on the ICE website, and also agreed to rescind the implementation of the directive. Instead, the government said it would return to the March policy. As a result, the court mooted the preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order motions and in October 2020, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. <hr>\n\n<b>Background</b>\nGenerally speaking, F-1 visas (colloquially \"student visas\") can be granted to international students who attend American universities. However, regulations on the granting of these visas limit the amount of online or distance learning the student can engage in. According to these regulations, an international student can engage in only one such class or three credits of that class per semester. 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G).\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 made this regulation untenable, as schools and universities had to shift to online learning systems. In response, defendant ICE issued an exemption on March 13, 2020, affirming that international students would be permitted to continue distance learning in the United States under their F-1 visas. The exemption would apply until the end of the emergency. However, on July 6, 2020, ICE issued a new directive stating that it would rescind that exemption. This directive would then mean that international students at schools that would still be fully online would have to either transfer to other schools that were at least partially in-person, go back to their countries voluntarily, or risk deportation. The directive also ordered schools that had gone fully online or had simply decided not to have classes to submit an \"operational change plan\" within nine days, and ordered schools that would have a hybrid system to certify each F-1 student to make sure that they were not taking entirely online courses.\n\n<b>The Lawsuit</b>\nThis lawsuit was filed on July 8, 2020, two days after the directive was issued. Plaintiffs were the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and were represented by private counsel. Defendants were the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The universities claimed that the new directive violated the Administrative Procedure Act in three ways: 1) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to address the reliance interests of both universities that had already engaged in extensive planning and international students expectations of their immigration status; 2) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to offer a reasoned basis to justify the policy; and 3) defendants failed to comply with notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures in issuing this directive. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the agencies from enforcing the new directive. Plaintiffs also requested that the court vacate and set aside the directive in addition to declaratory relief and attorney's fees and costs. \n\nThe case was originally assigned to Judge Douglas P. Woodlock but he immediately recused himself and it was reassigned to Judge Allison D. Borroughs. Fifteen parties filed amicus briefs in support of the universities motion, representing the interests of dozens of higher education institutions, education nonprofits, labor unions, and tech corporations.\n\nOn July 14, the parties informed the court that the government agreed to rescind the July 6 directive, as well as the associated FAQ on the ICE website, and also agreed to rescind the implementation of the directive.

The plaintiffs sued the County of Monterey and the California Forensic Medical Group (CFMG) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Northern California, the ACLU National Prison Project, the Monterey Public Defender, and private attorneys, asked for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the conditions in the Monterey County Jail (the \"Jail\") violated federal and state law due to failures to protect prisoners from violence, provide adequate medical and mental health care, and provide reasonable accommodations to prisoners with disabilities. \n\nOn April 25, 2015, the County and Sheriff's Office filed a motion to dismiss, and the CFMG filed a motion to dismiss on May 2, 2014. The District Court (Magistrate Judge Paul Singh Grewal) denied both motions on September 29, 2014. 2014 WL 4843945 (N.D. Cal. 2014). First, the Court found that the plaintiffs had standing even if they were no longer incarcerated, due to the short average length of stay of prisoners in the putative class and the slow speed of legal action. Second, the Court addressed the issue of whether a private provider of jail medical facilities are \"services\" that can face scrutiny under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Court found that the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded that CFMG was subject to Title III of the ADA because it operates a \"professional office of a health care provider, hospital, or other service establishment\" within the jail.  The Court further explained that, although the \"place\" of a jail fell under Title II of the ADA as a public entity, courts had consistently found that Title III applied to \"places of public accommodation\" within places that normally don't fit under Title III either because they are owned by or operated for other purposes by a public entity.\n\nOn April 29, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking certification of a prisoner class consisting of all current and future prisoners in the jail, and a subclass of prisoners with disabilities, consisting of all current and future prisoners who have a qualifying disability.

The jail agreed to set new standards for the medical and mental health care provided to inmates and to expand accessibility for prisoners with disabilities. The parties agreed to retain experts as neutral monitors for a limited term of oversight. The parties planned for the jail to come into compliance with the Settlement Agreement within five years, unless they moved for an extension. The court was to retain jurisdiction over the settlement for this five year period.\n\nOn August 18, 2015, Magistrate Judge Grewal approved the settlement. Litigation continued over attorneys' fees as the settlement agreement only set upper limits for attorneys' fees of $4.8 million. On November 6, the parties stipulated to an agreement of how they would address the issue of interest on attorneys' fees.\n\nThe parties then litigated the implementation plan. After briefing and hearings, the court approved an implementation plan on May 27, 2016. \n\nOn June 6, 2016, the case was reassigned to Judge Beth Labson Freeman.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, there was some litigation over compliance issues. On March 19, 2018, the plaintiffs proposed an order regarding the use of telepsychiatry by the defendants, as per the settlement agreement. The court had instructed the parties that the defendants needed to have standards for when they could deviate from the typical in-person encounter and instead use “telemedicine or telepsychiatry.” After counsel met and decided on these issues, plaintiffs’ proposed order was signed and ordered by the judge on March 22, 2018.

Specifically, plaintiffs sought information \"concerning CBP’s local implementation of President Trump’s January 27, 2017 Executive Order...as well as any other judicial order or executive directive issued regarding Executive Order No. 1, including President Trump’s March 6, 2017 Executive Order.\" The request concerned implementation at international airports within the purview of CBP's Detroit Field Office. The request also concerned the number of individuals who were detained or subjected to secondary screening, extended questioning, enforcement examination, or consideration for a waiver at the aforementioned airports pursuant to the EO. \n\nIn the complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the requested records \"would facilitate the public’s understanding of how Defendants implemented and enforced the Executive Orders through the Detroit Field Office\" and that \"[s]uch information is critical to the public’s ability to hold the government accountable.\" The complaint stated that \"Michigan residents were among those most severely impacted by the Executive Orders...Of the major metropolitan areas in the United States, Detroit has the highest number of residents per capita from the seven countries barred under Executive Order No. 1.\"\n\nOn May 8, the government filed a motion to treat all of these FOIA cases as \"multidistrict litigation\" effectively consolidating them before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: In this case filed on April 23, 2020 by an Illinois State Representative, an Illinois Circuit Court judge issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the Governor of Illinois from enforcing the state's stay at home order against the plaintiff. Later, the judge declared that both the Governor's extension of the stay at home order and the order itself exceeded his authority. The Illinois Supreme Court transferred this case to consolidate it with other COVID-19-related litigation, and the Governor is seeking to vacate the original judge's declaratory judgment.<hr>\n\nOn April 23, 2020, an Illinois State Representative filed this lawsuit suit in the Clay County Circuit Court. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sued the Governor of Illinois under state law, asserting that the governor lacked authority under the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act (the Act) to extend the state's stay at home order through the end of April. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the extended stay at home order was \"in excess of the authority granted . . . under the act.\" The plaintiff also sought to enjoin the Governor from enforcing the extended stay at home order against the plaintiff. \n\nThis case arose from Illinois' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 9, 2020, the Governor issued a proclamation under the Act declaring that the COVID-19 pandemic was a public health emergency rising to the level of a disaster. The Act conferred on the Governor emergency powers for 30 days following the declaration. Under his emergency powers, the Governor issued an executive order on March 20 requiring that Illinois residents only leave their home for essential activities or business. This executive order was effective until April 8. On April 1, the Governor declared that the COVID-19 pandemic was a \"continuing public health emergency\" and issued an executive order extending the stay at home requirement until April 30. \n\nThe plaintiff asserted that under the Act, the Governor lacked the authority to extend the March 20 executive order beyond April 8, which was 30 days after the initial disaster declaration. The plaintiff further alleged that the executive order \"limit[ed] [the plaintiff's] constitutionally protected freedoms in that it ordered him to stay at home, or at his place of residence, as well as limited his ability to travel within the state.\" \n\nThe plaintiff also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), asserting that the executive order was causing irreparable harm by ordering him to stay at home and avoid travel. \n\nThe same day, Judge Michael McHaney granted the the plaintiff's motion for a TRO and enjoined the Governor from enforcing the stay at home order against the plaintiff. Judge McHaney found that the plaintiff \"has a clearly ascertainable right in need of immediate protection, namely his liberty interest to be free from [defendant's] executive order of quarantine in his own home.\" Judge McHaney also concluded that the plaintiff had a reasonable likelihood of succeeding on the merits, would suffer irreparable harm if a TRO were not issued, and had no adequate remedy at law.\n\nThe Governor immediately appealed to the Fifth District Appellate Court and filed an emergency motion for direct appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. Before the appellate court could rule, the plaintiff consented to the vacating of the TRO, and the matter was remanded to the circuit court on May 1. \n\nOn May 13, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The plaintiff maintained his argument that the Governor exceeded his authority in extending the stay at home order. In addition, the plaintiff asserted that the April 30 disaster proclamation was void because the continuing public health emergency failed to meet the statutory definition of a disaster. The plaintiff further argued that the governor \"had no Illinois constitutional authority to restrict citizen's movement or activities and/or forcibly close the business premises\" and that this authority was delegated to the Department of Health.\n\nOn May 18, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. \n\nOn May 21, the Governor removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. He asserted that the district court had federal question jurisdiction because the \"action seeks redress for alleged deprivations of [plaintiff's] federal constitutional rights caused by actions taken under color of state law.\" He asserted that the action sought to redress the \"alleged deprivation of [plaintiff's] . . . First Amendment right to free exercise of religion, his Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, his right to interstate travel, and the right to a Republican Form of Government conferred by Article IV, Section 4 of the United States Constitution.\" The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Gilbert C. Sison.\n\nLater that day, the plaintiff filed an emergency motion to remand the case. The plaintiff argued that the matter raised \"nothing but questions concerning Defendant's authority under certain Illinois statutes\" and asserted that the defendant was \"intent on forum shopping and want[ed] nothing more than to derail state court proceedings.\" Plaintiff further contended that \"Whether or not Defendant’s actions infringe on rights existing under the United States Constitution is irrelevant to and mentioned nowhere in Plaintiff’s complaint or first amended complaint\" and that \"the core of Plaintiff’s causes of action, is not 'capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance.'” Plaintiff additionally sought expedited relief and attorneys' fees. \n\nA day later, on May 22, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a statement of interest supporting the plaintiff's motion \"because the plaintiff makes no federal claim.\" First, the DOJ asserted that the defendant misread the amended complaint and that \"plaintiff has elected to proceed on only state law claims, and removal is thus improper.\" Moreover, the DOJ contended that the Governor exceeded his authority when issuing the executive orders. Lastly, the DOJ argued that while the case had federal implications, these implications were not sufficient to support removal. \n\nOn June 29, 2020, Judge Sison remanded the case. While calling the decision \"a close call,\" Judge Sison reasoned that the \"most straightforward reading\" of the amended complaint was that the plaintiff sued under the Illinois declaratory judgment statute seeking resolution of state-law questions about the extent of the Governor's power; any implicit federal constitutional issues were \"not central\" to the case. Judge Sison also rejected the Governor's argument that 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) (a largely defunct statute that allows civil rights plaintiffs to sue in federal court regardless of the amount in controversy, useful decades ago when 28 U.S.C. § 1331 had an amount in controversy requirement) conferred broader jurisdiction than § 1331. However, Judge Sison rejected the plaintiff's motion for fees, finding that removal was non-frivolous since the complaint referred to constitutional rights. 2020 WL 3498428. \n\nThree days later, Judge McHaney granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiff. Judge McHaney declared that the Governor's second and third disaster proclamations were void because they arose from the same \"occurrence or threat\" that gave rise to the first proclamation yet extended beyond the Act's 30-day limit. Judge McHaney also declared that the proclamations' substantive provisions were invalid because the Act did not give the Governor \"any authority to restrict a citizen's movement or activities.\" In addition, Judge McHaney held that the decision applied to all citizens of Illinois. But he declined to issue an injunction and denied summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims that COVID-19 did not meet the Act's definition of a disaster.\n\nOn July 7, the Governor moved to dismiss the plaintiff's remaining claim that COVID-19 was not a disaster under the Act. \n\nMeanwhile, the plaintiff felt that the Governor had not complied with the circuit court's summary judgment ruling. So, he filed a motion to hold the Governor in civil contempt on August 5, 2020. In response, the circuit court on August 7 issued the Governor a show cause order. The Governor sought a supervisory order from the Illinois Supreme Court, which stayed the contempt hearing on August 11 but refused to issue a supervisory order. Instead, the Court ordered this case consolidated with <i>Craig v. Pritzker</i>, No. 20 MR 589, in the Sangamon County Circuit Court before Judge Raylene D. Grischow. \n\nAfter consolidation, the Governor promptly filed a motion to vacate the Clay County Circuit Court's July 2 summary judgement decision for lack of jurisdiction. That motion is pending as of October 12, 2020; the case is ongoing.

{"document": "On January 25, 2012, this class action was brought by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) and the United Cerebral Palsy Association of Oregon and Southwest Washington, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. The plaintiffs claimed that the State of Oregon and its Offices of Developmental Disability Services and Vocational Rehabilitation Services, along with other state agencies, violated the Americans With Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and the Rehabilitation Act by operating an employment services program that unnecessarily separated disabled participants from nondisabled participants. The plaintiffs claimed these segregated settings deprived members of the plaintiff class (more than 2,300 people in the state) of supported employment services, the opportunity to work alongside nondisabled persons, and the ability to compete for higher-paying jobs. They claimed the state's policy discriminated against them based on disability. The plaintiffs sought certification of their proposed class, declaratory relief, and a permanent injunction to limit unnecessary segregation in the defendants' employment services program and to provide an adequate array of integrated employment and supported employment services. \n\nOn April 3, 2012, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs were attempting to create \"a new cause of action\" by extending the ADA's integration mandate beyond the requirement to provide community and home-based services (which were designed to prevent unnecessary institutionalization) to also include employment services. The defendants argued that (1) employment claims were not covered by Title II of the ADA; (2) the integration mandate did not apply because a denial of employment services did not place any plaintiff at risk of institutionalization; (3) the plaintiffs' claims sought to require the defendants to provide a service that the state did not and could not provide; and (4) the plaintiffs' claims improperly imposed a certain standard of care on the state's provision of employment services. At the core of the defendants' argument was the notion that the integration mandate of the ADA applied only to a person's place of residency and not place of employment.\n\nOn April 20, 2012, the United States submitted a statement of interest regarding the motion to dismiss. It cited that contrary to defendant’s motion to dismiss, Title II of the ADA forms a clear and comprehensive mandate to end the segregation of persons with disabilities in virtually all aspects of American life.\n\nOn May 17, 2012, Magistrate Judge Janice M. Stewart held that the integration mandate applies equally to employment-related services and to services allowing persons to live outside institutions. 841 F.Supp.2d 1199. The court did, however, find that the plaintiffs sought \"the forbidden remedy\" of requiring defendants to provide an adequate level of employment services to enable plaintiffs to obtain a competitive job in their initial complaint. The court dismissed the complaint without prejudice and with leave to amend.  On May 29, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with changes made to correct errors identified by the court.  \n\nThe court then addressed the question of class certification. The plaintiffs sought to certify a class consisting of \"all individuals in Oregon with intellectual or developmental disabilities who are in, or who have been referred to, sheltered workshops\" and \"who are qualified for supported employment services.\" The plaintiffs argued that the evidence needed to resolve the common questions of law and fact was the same for all class members. On August 6, 2012, the court granted class certification. 283 F.R.D. 587.\n\nOn May 24, 2014, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division filed an intervenor complaint on behalf of the United States, which included evidence of a nine-month investigation into Oregon’s failure to comply with the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\n\nSome individual members of the class viewed sheltered work as equally valuable as integrated work and moved to intervene on the concern that their ability to choose sheltered work would be curtailed.

The state also committed to end funding for sheltered workshop placements for youth newly eligible for state-funded employment, to provide at least 4,900 youth with employment services to help them access integrated employment, and to work with the state Department of Human Services in seeking financial incentives for providers to hire individuals with I/DD and in obtaining integrated employment.

The plaintiffs sued the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity (Commission), the Executive Office of the President of the United States, the Executive Office of the Vice President of the United States, and several agents of the executive branch,  all under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The plaintiffs also sued the Florida Secretary of State under state law, namely Florida Statute § 97.0585: Information Regarding Voters and Voter Registration Confidentiality. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and other public interest counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nThis complaint, brought on behalf of Florida voters, challenged the legality of the actions of the Commission and the legality of its directive requesting voter registration information of state-registered voters in Florida and throughout the United States. The plaintiffs sought to prevent the unauthorized collection of state voter information data and to prohibit the Florida Secretary of State and other similarly situated officials of other states from providing state voter data to the Commission. The plaintiffs claimed that the actions of the Commission and other defendants constituted an unjustified invasion of privacy in violation of the constitutional separation of powers, Article II, and voters’ First Amendment rights.\n\nOn July 13, 2017, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order, asking the court to prohibit the defendants from collecting every American voter’s personal data to create a national, centralized database, to prohibit the defendants from running all business until fully complying with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and to restrain the Florida Secretary of State from submitting to the Commission any voter data in violation of Fla. Stat. § 97.0585 and Florida’s Right to Privacy. The court held a hearing on July 18, 2017, regarding this motion. Unfortunately, the details of this hearing are not available on the docket.

The court denied this motion to stay, finding that if there were a stay and the court ultimately denied the motion, this case would have been significantly behind schedule.\n\nOn October 20, 2017, the federal defendants moved to dismiss this action, arguing that the case lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs failed to establish standing. In December 2017, the federal defendants moved for a protective order staying discovery until the court ruled on the federal defendants’ pending motion to dismiss.\n\nOn December 29, 2017, however, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing a claim that the federal defendants had exceeded the authority of Executive Order 13799. As such, the court denied as moot both the motions to dismiss as they were regarding the initial complaint.\n\nOn January 5, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs filed this motion because on January 3, 2018, President Trump issued an Executive Order terminating the Commission after the defendants and other had successfully worked together to transfer private, protected voter data to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that, in using Commission data, the Federal Defendants sought to “Stop Aliens From Voting,” without complying with FACA and argued that injunctive relief was appropriate to compel government compliance with FACA. The court referred this motion to Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman. 2018 WL 333821.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, Judge Goodman issued a report and recommendation regarding the plaintiffs’ emergency motion.

The court granted the defendant Secretary’s motion because Florida had already provided the Commission with the publicly available information, and the Commission had been disbanded. As such, there was no continuing case or controversy with respect to the Secretary. The court granted the federal defendants’ motion for similar reasons.

Judge O’Meara noted that the plaintiffs’ negligence claims did not involve a substantial federal question and that the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) could not support federal jurisdiction because CAFA’s local controversy exception applied: there was a significant local defendant, more than two-thirds of the proposed class were Michiganders, the injuries happened in Michigan, and there was no similar class action against any of the defendants. \n\nThe defendants appealed.

{"document": "On June 8, 2011, several veterans, on behalf of all homeless veterans suffering from disabilities caused by their military service, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the Department of Veterans' Affairs alleging violations of state law and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest and private counsel, asked the court for an injunction requiring the defendants to provide the plaintiff class with permanent supportive housing that accommodates their disabilities so that they can access the VHA benefits for which they are eligible.  They also requested that the court enjoin defendants from using the West Los Angeles Medical Center & Community Living Center campus (WLA Campus) for any purpose that is not directly related to housing veterans with disabilities and to require an accounting of profits of all money received for land use agreements for the WLA campus. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the design and implementation of the VHA benefits program was discriminatory and that plaintiffs were being denied meaningful access to benefits by defendants because of their disabilities. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiff claimed that the WLA campus was intended, under the grant that established it, to provide housing and services for veterans with disabilities. By entering into land use agreements with commercial and non-DVA entities, defendants violated the grant, which plaintiffs argued was a charitable trust. Additionally, plaintiffs alleged that there was never a public accounting of the transactions. Plaintiffs claimed that this lack of housing prevented the plaintiffs from meaningfully accessing the veterans' benefits to which they were entitled.\n\nAn amended complaint filed Aug. 12, 2011 added claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.). \n\nOn Mar. 16, 2012, the court (Judge S. James Otero) dismissed in part the plaintiff's claims. 860 F. Supp. 2d 1079. After the Ninth Circuit vacated <i>Veterans for Common Sense v. Shinseki</i>, 644 F.3d 845, on which the court had relied, it reconsidered the Mar. 16 ruling. Eventually, the en banc Ninth Circuit issued <i>Veterans for Common Sense v. Shinseki</i>, 678 F.3d 1013. Based on that decision, the court found that it lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' Rehabilitation Act claims because resolving the claims would require the court to second-guess the government's determination about what benefits specific veterans were entitled to. But the court let the plaintiffs' Administrative Procedure Act claims proceed because they did not turn on questions about specific veterans' benefits. 2012 WL 12882704. \n\nMediation was attempted during the course of proceedings, but it proved unsuccessful. Following the mediation, both parties moved for summary judgment. \n\nOn Aug. 29, 2013, the court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, declaring the land use agreements that defendant had with non-healthcare organizations were unauthorized by law and therefore void. 2013 WL 12121981.\n\nThe defendants moved to vacate the judgment, which was denied on Oct. 21, 2013, and then appealed to the Ninth Circuit on Oct. 24. Meanwhile, the parties continued to attempt to find resolution outside of the courtroom, and filed notice of their decision to end litigation on Jan. 28, 2015. The parties stated that they would work together to create a strategy and action plan for veteran homelessness in Greater LA. The final plan was to address chronic homelessness through evidence-based methods and with input from all stakeholders. The VA would address various issues related to creating a plan for the WLA Campus, including bridge housing, permanent supportive housing, and land use agreements.\n\nOn Feb. 17, 2015, pursuant to a joint motion to vacate, the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court's judgment.

{"document": "On February 8, 2017, three organizations—Public Citizen, Inc., Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., and Communications Workers of America—filed this lawsuit against the United States of America, President Donald Trump, and 14 federal agencies, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss.\n\nOne week prior, on January 30, President Trump had signed Executive Order 13771.The order instructed federal agencies to rescind at least two existing regulations for every new regulation issued, and to ensure that the costs of new regulations were offset by the rescinded regulations. All regulations promulgated during fiscal year 2017 were required to have net costs of $0, regardless of benefits. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that Executive Order 13771 violated the Take Care Clause, exceeded Article II presidential power, and infringed on legislative authority, and was therefore invalid. They sought a declaration that the agencies could not lawfully implement or comply with the order, and sought an injunction preventing them from complying with the order. They argued that the order’s requirements would harm the people of the United States, and that the decision-making process required by this order was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. \n\nOn April 21, 2017 the plaintiffs amended their complaint. The government filed a motion to dismiss on May 12, and on May 15 the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. On February 26, 2018 the court granted the government’s motion to dismiss, denying the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. 297 F. Supp. 3d 6. It found that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of establishing standing to sue: they had failed to allege that the order would “substantially increase the risk” of harm to any of their members.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint two months later on April 20, 2018. On June 4, California and Oregon intervened as plaintiffs, arguing that they had “unique interests in the health and well-being of their citizens, natural resources, infrastructure, institutions, and economies” which could not be adequately represented by the non-governmental plaintiffs in the case. The following year, on February 8, 2019, the court denied the government’s motion to dismiss the second amended complaint: the plaintiffs had demonstrated standing to sue, sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. 361 F. Supp. 3d 60. However, the court simultaneously denied the plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment: they had “done enough to stay afloat but not enough to move forward.” Because there was still doubt as to standing, and therefore as to the court’s jurisdiction, the court denied the states’ motion to intervene as premature, indicating that they could renew their motion if the court ultimately found it had jurisdiction.\n\nBut on December 20, 2019 the court granted the government’s summary judgment motion, holding that the plaintiffs had failed to adequately establish standing. It found that although the court had previously “provided Plaintiffs with three opportunities to meet this burden and, most recently, allowed Plaintiffs to take focused discovery in aid of establishing jurisdiction,” the plaintiffs had still “failed to carry their burden.” 435 F.

{"document": "This case arose from the Flint water crisis, a public health emergency in which the city of Flint, Michigan supplied water that contained elevated levels of lead to the public. On April 6, 2016, fifteen residents of Flint, Michigan filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the Governor of Michigan, his chief of staff, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), several other government agencies, the City of Flint, and three corporations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (18 U.S.C § 1964), and state law. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, alleged that defendants’ involvement in the supply of lead-contaminated drinking water violated their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection rights, RICO, and state law.\n\nFlint had purchased water from the high quality Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) for roughly half a century before the crisis. But in 2014, led by an Emergency Manager, Flint switched its water source to the Flint River as a way to address the city’s financial problems. The plaintiffs alleged that, because the Flint River was only a temporary solution until the City could be connected to the Karegnondi Water Authority, the state knew that the Flint River was low quality even before connecting the City to the source. The plaintiffs claimed that by continuing to charge the residents of Flint the same amount for water despite the significantly lower quality, the defendants were fraudulently engaged in a RICO scheme by selling unsafe water. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that this deprived them of both contractually guaranteed property and bodily integrity rights protected under a substantive due process framework.\n\nFurther, the plaintiffs alleged that their Fourteenth Amendment right to Equal Protection was violated because the switch from the DWSD to the Flint River was motivated by racism. The plaintiffs’ evidence of racial discrimination was the fact that, of the six municipalities that bought water from DWSD through which the Flint River flowed, only the predominantly Black City of Flint was switched to the Flint River source.\n\nBecause this case appeared to be a companion case to <i>Mays v. Snyder</i> (Case No. 15-14002), on April 20, 2016, this case was reassigned to District Judge John Corbertt O’Meara and Magistrate Judge Mona K. Majzoub in Ann Arbor.\n\nOn June 30, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding a jury demand and several additional defendants in their official capacities at all times relevant to the complaint, some of which included the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), the former treasurer of the State of Michigan, all four emergency managers assigned to the city of Flint, the elected mayor of the City of Flint, and the directors and managers of several city and state health programs and water treatment plants. Another amended complaint was filed by the plaintiffs on August 12, 2016.\n\nOn October 6, 2016, the State of Michigan, the Governor, MDEQ, MDHHS, and several individual government employees being sued in their official capacity filed a motion to dismiss. Another group of defendants—the Emergency Managers and City Officials of the City of Flint named in their official capacity as defendants in the suit—also filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ second amended complaint for similar reasoning as the other defendants. Additional motions to dismiss were filed on October 21st, 28th, and 31st. Although filed separately, all of the motions argued primarily the same reasons for dismissing the plaintiffs’ suit: the state defendants were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and the Court had already declared that the only federal remedy available for the plaintiffs’ grievances is the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nMeanwhile, two cases with similar claims had recently been decided and were consolidated on appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit: <a href=https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17168><i>Mays v.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This lawsuit was filed against the state of Michigan by 22 individual companies operating fitness businesses in Michigan and an organization representing over 150 fitness facilities in the state to enjoin executive orders that caused their facilities to remain closed. The court granted a preliminary injunction on June 19. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit stayed the lower court's injunction on June 24. <hr>\n\nOn May 22, 2020, owners and operators of Michigan’s indoor fitness facilities filed a suit against the Governor of the State of Michigan and the Director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to enjoin orders that required the plaintiffs to keep their facilities closed. The plaintiffs brought this lawsuit as a declaratory and injunctive action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202, and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Lockdown Orders violated the  Constitution, an order enjoining the state from enforcing the lockdown orders, and a prohibition form issuing further orders that would require the plaintiffs to keep their businesses closed. The case filed in the U.S District Court for the Western District of Michigan and assigned to District Judge Paul L Maloney.  \n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, were comprised of 22 individual companies operating fitness businesses in Michigan, as well as the League of Independent Fitness Facilities and Trainers (LIFFT), an organization representing over 150 fitness facilities in the state. \n\nOn March 16, Governor Whitmer issued temporary restrictions on the uses of public facilities, which included gymnasiums, fitness centers, recreation centers, and indoor sports facilities. Throughout June, the defendant incrementally re-opened sectors of the economy with Michigan Executive order 2020-110 and 2020-115. The orders lifted certain restrictions on facilities such as restaurants, bowling, and climbing facilities subject to capacity restrictions, but left indoor fitness facilities remained completely closed. The plaintiffs alleged that the differential treatment of indoor fitness facilities violated substantive and procedural due process and equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the Dormant Commerce Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Emergency Management Act. Further, the plaintiffs alleged that the order was void for vagueness as the defendant did not identify the criteria for which businesses were allowed to operate during the pandemic. They also alleged that the defendant exceeded the Governor’s authority in violation of the separation of powers doctrine in the Michigan constitution.\n\nThe complaint was amended on June 1 to add 15 additional plaintiffs. On June 8, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the orders. On June 12, the defendants filed a response to the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The defendants contended that the plaintiff LIFFT lacked organizational standing as it failed to establish injury-in-fact for the pre-enforcement claim, and therefore, should be dismissed. Oral argument was held on June 17. On the same day, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing. \n\nOn June 19, the preliminary injunction was granted. 2020 WL 3421229. The court found that while the state was empowered to address emergencies like pandemics largely without interference from the courts, it was subject to constitutional limitations. Because the court found that the defendant was unable to state a rational basis to support the continued closure of indoor gyms, it did not survive deferential review. \n\nOn the same day, the defendant filed an appeal to the Sixth Circuit, and also an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal filed at the district court. On June 22, the plaintiffs filed a motion in opposition to the stay pending appeal. The same day, the district court denied the defendants’ emergency motion to stay. 2020 WL 3422586. \n\nOn June 24, the Sixth Circuit granted the defendant’s motion for an emergency stay, contending that the public interest of combatting COVID-19 outweighed the plaintiffs’ in favor of the stay. 2020 WL 3468281. The Sixth Circuit disagreed with the district court on whether the State demonstrated a rational basis to justify the plaintiffs’ continued closure, therefore surviving deferential review. The plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Sixth Circuit to reconsider the order, but the Sixth Circuit denied the motion on July 7.\n\nBack in the district court, the plaintiffs responded to the defendants motion to dismiss on July 16, 2020.

For a full list of these cases please see our collection of the Contraception Insurance Mandate cases <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=12\">here</a>.\n\nOn October 22, 2013, a for-profit company filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of D.C. under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the First Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiff, represented in part by the public interest firm American Center for Law and Justice, asked the court for an exception to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandate requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage of contraception. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that providing insurance coverage of contraception would violate the deeply held religious beliefs of the corporation's owners.\n\nOn November 27, 2013, United States District Court (Judge Reggie B. Walton) granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for preliminary injunction and stayed the case. The Court ordered the defendant not to enforce the ACA insurance mandate regarding contraception against the plaintiff until 30 days after the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12714&\">Gilardi v.

They also agreed that the issue of plaintiff's attorneys’ fees and costs would be resolved after the judgement was entered.\n\nThe court adopted the parties' proposed permanent injunction on November 3, 2014. The defendant was enjoined from enforcing the “Contraceptive Coverage Requirement,” that required the plaintiff to provide its employees with health coverage for contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and related patient education and counseling to which the plaintiff objected on religious grounds. It also barred defendant from taking any actions against plaintiff for noncompliance with the \"Contraception Coverage Requirement.\" The only issue left open was attorneys' fees.\n\nThe parties reached an undisclosed agreement regarding attorneys' fees on March 17, 2015, and asked the court to close the case.

{"document": "This case is about discrimination that students with disabilities face in the Oregon Public School system. On January 22, 2019, plaintiffs brought a class-action suit against the Oregon Department of Education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs sought to address the long-standing problem in Oregon of denying students with disabilities the ability to attend a full-day of school or in some cases, the chance to attend school at all.\n\nJ.N., the lead plaintiff, was a 6-year-old public school student. He had a disability and was eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA. Due to behaviors related to his disability, J.N. had been subjected to a shortened school day. When he was in kindergarten, J.N. was forced to attend a truncated form of school for the entire 2017-2018 school year. For a few months, this meant that J.N.'s entire day of schooling was only an hour. Other plaintiffs also were subject to shortened school days, including schooling under an hour a day, as a result of their disability. \n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the discriminatory consequences of the shortened school day policy violated the IDEA, the ADA, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Under the IDEA, every state has to \"ensure\" that it provides \"special education\" and \"related services\" to all children with disabilities aged 3 to 21 who reside in the state. The IDEA also requires that every child be provided a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Under Title II of the ADA, individuals with disabilities cannot be excluded from participating in, excluded from the benefits of, or be discriminated against in public school. Title II also requires that all students regardless of disability status be provided with an equal education. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that institutions receiving federal funding provide assistance and benefits to individuals with disabilities.\n\nIn the complaint, the plaintiffs requested the following relief: a permanent enjoinder of defendants from subjecting the plaintiffs to policies that violate the IDEA, the ADA, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; an order requiring defendants to create and implement new policies that would ensure compliance with FAPE standards; and an order demanding that defendants develop and maintain policies and practices to ensure that the State of Oregon and individual Oregon school districts do not discriminate against students with disabilities, including exclusion of students with disabilities from a full school day. The case was assigned to Judge Ann L. Aiken. \n\nOn April 19, 2019, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss.

{"document": "On February 26, 2013, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sent notice to the Alabama Department of Corrections that it would be conducting an investigation of the Julia Tutwiler Prison. The investigation sought to address allegations that prisoners were subjected to sexual abuse by prison staff in violation of their constitutional rights; allegations that the prison failed to report and prevent sexual abuse; and allegations that the prison failed to provide adequate mental health and medical care to victims of sexual abuse. On January 17, 2014, the DOJ issued a findings letter. The department's findings detailed unconstitutional conditions that subjected women prisoners to a substantial risk of harm. These conditions included staff sexual abuse and sexual harassment of prisoners, prison officials' failure to adequately respond to and investigate allegations of sexual abuse and harassment, and systemic deficiencies that directly contributed to staff and prisoner sexual abuse and staff sexual harassment.\n\nOn May 28, 2015, the DOJ Civil Rights Division filed this lawsuit against the state of Alabama and its Department of Corrections (ADOC) under CRIPA for the heinous sexual abuse committed by the ADOC's male officers at Tutwiler. And the parties had reached a settlement agreement and subsequently submitted a motion for its approval, which Judge Myron Thompson accepted on June 18, 2015. The court issued a consent decree and designated an independent monitor.\n\nThe settlement required the ADOC and Tutwiler to make recommended changes and file compliance reports every six months. The substantive part of the settlement agreement contained sections on General Policies and Procedures, staffing and training, risk assessment and education, rights to privacy and reporting, and response and investigation procedures to reports of sexual assault.\n\nThe policy section of the agreement required ADOC and Tutwiler to: <ul> <li> Develop, submit to the Monitor and DOJ for review, and implement policies and procedures regarding the management of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming prisoners; <li> Comply with its policy ensuring women receive essential supplies; <li> Develop and implement policies and procedures that incorporate gender-responsive strategies, including policies and procedures governing the use of force against women prisoners and other disciplinary actions; <li> Develop, submit to the Monitor and DOJ for review and implement facility-specific policies and operational practices specific to Tutwiler' s population regarding the supervision and monitoring necessary to prevent inmates from being exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm from sexual abuse and harassment; and <li> Revise and/or develop and implemen any other policies, practices, procedures, protocols, training curricula, and other written documents as necessary, including but not limited to, screening tools, logs, handbooks, manuals, and forms. </ul> \nThe consent decree was set to be in effect until ADOC was found in substantial compliance in three consecutive compliance reports.\n\nThe monitor filed the first report on February 26, 2016 on the assessment period for May–Dec. 2015. The monitor noted positive progress and granted a 3-month extension for compliance on the general policies and procedures and training. From February 2016 through August 2019, the monitor filed a total of eight reports indicating steady progress. In the eighth and most recent report, the monitor noted that Tutwiler and the ADOC achieved \"substantial compliance\" with 41 sections of the settlement agreement and \"partial compliance\" with two sections of the agreement. \n\nAs of August 2019, Tutwiler's and the ADOC's general policies continued to work toward preventing sexual abuse and harassment. The monitor noted that staff exhibited knowledge of procedures related to reporting sexual harassment, safety for inmates, and investigative processes. In addition, the monitor found that Tutwiler and the ADOC fully implemented the required Behavior Intervention & Discipline Policy and Disciplinary Segregation policies. Tutwiler's and the ADOC's use of camera recording also satisfied the monitor, although the monitor found that audio capabilities would further surveillance efforts. Further, the ADOC's and Tutwiler's inmate education program communicating the right to be free from sexual abuse and harassment and right to privacy satisfied their duties as outlined in the agreement. \n\nThe monitor found some challenges still exist at the Tutwiler facility.

Some of their claims were mooted as to the June elections as South Carolina legislation passed on May 12 allowed voters to vote by absentee ballot. On May 25, the court partially granted a preliminary injunction, enjoining the witness requirement for the June 2020 primaries. <hr>\nOn May 1, 2020 several South Carolina political candidates and voters, as well as the South Carolina Democratic Party, the Democratic National Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, filed this action in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, seeking relief from five voting provisions in the state law: <blockquote>(1)  the \"Absentee Ballot Age Restriction,\" which prohibited all voters under 65 from casting mail-in ballots unless they are disabled or confined in jail; (2) the \"Postage Tax,\" which required voters to pay postage for their absentee ballot if they wished to vote; (3) the \"Election Day Cutoff,\" which rejected ballots not received by 7 pm on election day; (4) the \"Absentee Assistance Ban,\" which prohibited candidates or paid campaign staff from assisting absentee voters; and (5) the \"Witness Requirement,\" which required a witness to sign the absentee ballot in order for the vote to be counted. </blockquote>The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sued the South Carolina State Election Commission and the Election Commissioner. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02 for violations of the First, Fourteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments, as well as the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. §§ 10301-02. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that South Carolina's laws surrounding absentee voting unconstitutionally burdened the rights of some voters, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The case was assigned to Judge Michelle Childs. \n\nOn May 7, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction to stop the defendants from enforcing the Absentee Ballot Age Restriction, the Witness Requirement, and the Election Day Cutoff. They also requested the court to consolidate the motion hearing with <a href=\"https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17521\"> another action</a> where the plaintiffs had filed a motion for preliminary injunction against the same defendants.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican Party moved to intervene on May 11, which was granted on May 12.\n\nAdditionally, on May 12, the South Carolina General Assembly passed legislation allowing all qualified South Carolina voters to vote by absentee ballot for the June 9 primary and the June 23 runoff election. These legislative changes mooted the plaintiffs' requests as to the Excuse Requirement and the Absentee Ballot Age Requirement for the June primaries. In light of the hearing scheduled for May 15, the plaintiffs attempted to extend their request for relief beyond the June primaries. The court limited the issues for the hearing, stating that the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction clearly sought only relief for June, and as such, the defendants had not been given proper notice.\n\nThe defendants and intervenors filed oppositions to the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction on May 14.\n\nOn May 25, the court granted the motion for preliminary injunction in part, enjoining the defendants from enforcing the Witness Requirement for the June 2020 primaries.

Plaintiffs, represented by public interest and private counsel, claimed that Defendant failed to provide them with services in the most integrated setting appropriate.  Specifically, Plaintiffs claimed that Defendants' policies and practices resulted in Plaintiffs' unnecessary isolation at Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center (Laguna Honda).  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel Defendants to provide them with timely access to home and community-based long-term care services.\n\nNamed Plaintiffs were a number of current adult residents of Laguna Honda who had disabilities but had been recommended for discharge or who had been identified as being able to live in the community with appropriate service provision.  \n\nAt the time of filing, Laguna Honda housed more than 1,000 individuals.  It had been repeatedly cited for standard of care deficiencies, and CMS had threatened to withdraw federal funding from the hospital.

The court ordered the parties to meet with Judge Alsup to consider preliminary approval of the settlement agreement before ruling on the request for administrative relief.\n\nOn November 26, 2007, the court issued an order regarding the request for administrative relief.  The parties had agreed that no individual claims for damages by class members were waived under the settlement agreement. The parties also jointly recommended a $300,000 fee award to class counsel for fees and costs, and $200,000 for compliance oversight.  In light of the agreement, the Court approved the parties' joint request for administrative relief.\n\nThe parties signed a settlement agreement in December 2007.  The parties agreed as follows: the parties would assess the services and housing being provided to named Plaintiffs who had been discharged from Laguna Honda; San Francisco would provide a rental subsidy for independent housing for named Plaintiffs where appropriate; Defendant would alter or begin certain practices to maximize opportunities for class members to access home and community-based services through the Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver; Defendant would make a Diversion and Community Integration Program fully operational; Defendant would provide case management and wrap-around services; Defendant would preserve, provide, and monitor community-based housing for appropriate class members; Defendant would enhance mental health and substance abuse services at Laguna Honda; and Defendant would limit the capacity of Laguna Honda.  The settlement agreement also established grievance procedures for class members and data collection and reporting obligations.  The agreement was scheduled to terminate three years from the date of final approval by the Court.\n\nOn September 18, 2008, the Court granted final approval of the settlement agreement.  The Court entered judgment, awarded attorney fees and costs as agreed by the parties, and retained jurisdiction for the purpose of assuring compliance.\n\nThe parties filed a series of joint case management statements from 2009 through 2011 detailing the status of the implementation of the settlement agreement.

Both of the limited availability of registration centers and the requirement for in-person registration were absent from the defendant's standard food stamps program precisely because, as the plaintiffs argued, they discriminate against persons with disabilities who may not be able to travel to the registration center. The plaintiffs, represented by the Legal Aid Society of New York, asked the court for a preliminary injunction, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, the District Court (Judge Katherine B. Forrest) denied plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction as the plaintiffs failed to prove that irreparable harm would result if the injunction was not granted. Judge Forrest also dismissed plaintiffs' complaint finding that the plaintiffs needed to  sue the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in his official capacity in order to properly bring the suit as they authorized the D-SNAP plan and also paid part of the liabilities under D-SNAP.\n\nOn March 29, 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in his official capacity and the U.S. Department of Agriculture as defendants. The new complaint also added a claim for retroactive award of D-SNAP benefits to those who were excluded from the program due to the alleged discriminatory practices.\n\nOn September 16, 2013, the District Court certified two subclasses: (1) \"disabled individuals who were eligible to apply for benefits from the Sandy D-SNAP Program,\" and (2) \"individuals who may be eligible to apply for benefits from a future D-SNAP program and who will need reasonable accommodations because of a disability (or disabilities).\" 2013 WL 5295221.\n\nOn November 14, 2013, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs' claims against the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture for lack of subject matter jurisdiction primarily on two grounds: (1) the Department of Agriculture assured the District Court that if the other defendants were found liable, then the federal government would pay its share of the D-SNAP benefits, and (2) plaintiffs cannot sue the Department of Agriculture because there is no clear cause of action concerned that if it were to recognize a cause of action against a government agency for providing emergency support to local governments then federal agencies would be more reluctant to lend help and advice during future emergencies. 2013 WL 6057949.\n\nOn January 22, 2014, the court referred the action to Magistrate Judge Andrew J. Peck for settlement discussions. The parties proceeded with settlement negotiations and periodic status conferences, and filed a joint motion for approval of class-action settlement on March 30, 2015. The settlement provided for retrospective relief ensuring that D-SNAP benefits were distributed in accordance with waiver requests, and prospective relief ensuring the administration of future D-SNAP benefits would comply with laws prohibiting disability discrimination. On March 31, 2015, Judge Forrest granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement.\n\nFollowing a June 25, 2015 fairness hearing, Judge Forrest entered final judgment approving the class action settlement and dismissing the case on July 7, 2015.

The suit remains ongoing. <hr>\n\nFour individuals incarcerated in the Clayton County Jail filed this complaint against the Clayton County Sheriff, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, on July 1, 2020.  The COVID-19 pandemic was sweeping through jails and prisons across the country, and the plaintiffs alleged that the jail was ignoring the health and safety of its inmates.  Instead of decreasing its population, like jails and prisons across the country and across Georgia, the jail was increasing its population.  The jail was infested with mold, mildew, cockroaches, and rodents, inmates were told to use underwear for face coverings, and many were forced to sleep on the floor next to open toilets.  Social distancing was nonexistent, jail staff did not educate inmates about COVID-19 risks or prevention, and inmates who became ill were waiting up to a week to be treated by medical staff.\n\nRepresented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Georgia, and the Southern Center for Human Rights, the plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Because their incarceration was unconstitutional, they argued, the court should issue a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §§2241 and 2243.  They also brought claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act, and sought a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. §2201-2202.  The petition was assigned to Judge Eleanor L. Ross, but she later recused herself and the case was reassigned to Judge J. P. Boulee.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought certification of two classes, each with two subclasses:<ol>the Pretrial Class, composed of all inmates who were at the jail awaiting trial, including:<ul><li>a Medically Vulnerable Subclass (inmates with medical conditions which placed them at higher risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19), and<li>a Disabilities Subclass (inmates whose medical conditions also qualified as disabilities under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act); and</li></ol><ol>the Post-Adjudication Class, composed of all inmates who were serving time in the prison following conviction of a crime, including:<ul><li>a Medically Vulnerable Subclass (inmates with medical conditions which placed them at higher risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19), and<li>a Disabilities Subclass (inmates whose medical conditions also qualified as disabilities under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act).</ol>They sought release or transfer for all members of the Medically Vulnerable and Disabilities Subclasses; an injunction requiring the jail to adopt measures to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection for the remaining inmates (including social distancing and personal protective equipment); a writ of habeas corpus directing the immediate transfer or release of the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses; and attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nThe court denied the request for preliminary injunctive relief on July 9, 2020, stating that such a request must be made by separate motion, not in the complaint.  The plaintiffs filed a separate motion for a preliminary injunction on July 27, 2020.  \n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the claims on August 3. The defendants argued that they were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, and that the plaintiffs failed to state both a habeas claim and an ADA claim.

This violated the College’s rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nAdditionally, the plaintiffs alleged that the Mandate’s requirements compelled the College to operate in a manner contrary to its religious beliefs, thus violating the guarantee of free speech as set out in the First Amendment.\n\nThe plaintiffs sent a notice of voluntary dismissal on January 14, 2013.

{"document": "On October 30, 2008, a pre-trial detainee of the Los Angeles City Central Jail filed a pro se complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Los Angeles County officials, the Los Angeles County Sheriff, and a medical doctor that served the jail. The plaintiff alleged that the conditions of confinement, specifically lack of a bed and infestation, violated his constitutional rights. Additionally, the plaintiff alleged he was denied prompt medical care when the defendant doctor failed to supply prescribed medication for 43 days.  The plaintiff sought compensatory damages in the amount of $33,000 and punitive damages in the amount of $333,000.\n\nThe plaintiff had entered jail custody in July 2006, and as he was being processed, there was a string of racially charged violent disturbances at several jail facilities.  Officials locked down multiple facilities, which delayed in-processing. As a result, the plaintiff was held at a facility without sufficient bench space for sleeping, and no beds or mattresses. He slept on the floor.\n\nOn November 9, 2009, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, which the Magistrate Judge Alicia G. Rosenberg recommended be granted in part and denied in part. On June 6, 2010, the District Court (Judge John F. Walter) adopted the Magistrate Judge's report and dismissed all claims except the claim against the Sheriff in his individual and official capacities for failure to provide adequate sleeping accommodations. \n\nOn September 14, 2010, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint against the Los Angeles County Sheriff in his official and individual capacities, alleging substantively the same claims for conditions of confinement. In response to the defendants' motion to dismiss the Second Amended complaint, the District Court dismissed all claims except the claim against the Sheriff in his individual capacity for failure to provide adequate sleeping conditions. \n\nOn April 30, 2013, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the remaining claim. A magistrate judge found that the newly supplemented record demonstrated that the Los Angeles County jail had faced difficult exigent circumstances in the aftermath of the disturbances and lockdown, and that this meant there had been no constitutional violation. The District Court agreed, dismissing the case on July 18, 2013. 2013 WL 3791419.  \n\nPlaintiff appealed, and On July 30, 2013, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.

{"document": "On June 30, 2018, eight Hurricane Maria evacuees from Puerto Rico who were receiving Transitional Shelter Assistance from Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) filed this putative class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The case was assigned to District Judge Timothy S. Hillman. \n\nThe plaintiffs sued FEMA under the Administrative Procedures Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act. The plaintiffs, represented by LatinoJustice PRLDEF (Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund), Hector E. Pineiro, and Manatt Phelps and Phillips, LLP, sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that FEMA was planning to unlawfully terminate the TSA program which provided direct funding to hotels and motels that served as shelters for Puerto Ricans who evacuated the territory due to Hurricane Maria. The plaintiffs specifically alleged that FEMA was planning to terminate its TSA program for Puerto Rican evacuees, without any plan to transition the evacuees into longer-term housing. The plaintiffs argued that this was in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Stafford Act that require nondiscrimination in disaster assistance. In their motion for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff’s sought to extend the provision of the TSA program until all eligible individuals either received temporary housing or found permanent housing.\n\nOn June 30, 2018, the same day the complaint was filed, Judge Leo T. Sorokin entered a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), enjoining FEMA from terminating the TSA program until at least midnight July 3, 2018, enabling Plaintiffs and the class to remain in transitional shelters until checkout time on July 4, 2018. \n\nRight as the initial TRO was set to end, Judge Hillman extended it until at least midnight July 23, 2018. Judge Hillman extended the TRO to give the parties an opportunity to fully brief the important and complex issues raised by plaintiffs’ complaint and their corresponding motion for preliminary injunction. \n\nJudge Hillman subsequently extended the TRO on two more occasions: July 19, 2018 (extending it until August 7, 2018) and on August 22, 2018 (extending it until August 31, 2018). \n\nIn plaintiffs' first amended complaint, filed on July 12, six named plaintiffs were dropped from the suit and two additional plaintiffs were added. Plaintiffs also asserted new claims for violation of their equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nPresumably because the plaintiffs had already received several extensions granting them access to temporary housing, on August 30, 2018, Judge Hillman denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court found that the plaintiffs did not have a high likelihood of success on the merits - the touchstone of the preliminary injunction inquiry. Judge Hillman ordered the defendants to refrain from terminating the program that provided the payment for shelter for the plaintiffs (including the class) until midnight September 13, 2018, in order to give the evacuees time to make alternative housing arrangements. \n\nOn September 20, 2018, Judge Hillman granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the case entirely.

{"document": "On June 13, 2000, thirty-one minor children in the legal custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families (\"DCAF\") filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The named plaintiffs were represented by the advocacy organization Children's Rights and by private counsel. Plaintiffs sought certification of a class of all children who are or will be in the legal custody of DCAF as an alleged or adjudicated dependent child; plaintiffs also sought certification of a subclass of all children who are black or perceived by DCAF as black. They asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that systemic deficiencies in the operation of DCAF subjected children in the state's care to harm or an unreasonable risk of harm.\n\nThe alleged problems included: overuse of shelters; failing to comply with permanency plans; keeping siblings apart; overcrowding of residential facilities; overworking of caseworkers; denying children safe and permanent homes; overmedicating children; using non-least restrictive placements; failure to provide for foster children's education; operating a foster care system for \"financial benefit\"; and discriminating on the basis of race and ethnicity, particularly against black children.\n\nOn August 30, 2000, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding new claims, including challenges brought under the Adoption and Safe Families Act; Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment; and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nOn September 11, 2000, plaintiffs moved to certify the class. On October 27, 2000, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action. Both motions were referred to Magistrate Judge Robert L. Dube.\n\nOn April 20, 2001, Magistrate Judge Dube issued a Report and Recommendation largely denying the defendants' motion to dismiss. The Magistrate denied defendants' motion with respect to all counts, except for the EPSDT claims, for which the Magistrate dismissed certain of the named plaintiffs. Bonnie L. ex rel. Hadsock v. Bush, No. 00-2116-CIV-Moreno Dube, 2001 WL 1840843 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 20, 2001). Defendants subsequently filed objections to the R&R.\n\nOn May 10, 2001, Magistrate Judge Dube issued a Report and Recommendation largely granting plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The Magistrate certified plaintiffs' proposed class and subclass, but excluded certain groups because they had been members of prior classes. Specifically, the Magistrate excluded the following from the class and subclass: (a) children who reside in Broward/District 10; (b) children who were in the custody of DCAF prior to July 24, 1995, but only for claims which arose prior to that date; and (c) any claims for the failure to provide mental health and/or developmental services. Bonnie L. ex rel. Hadsock v. Bush, No. 00-2116-CIV, 2001 WL 1400051 (S.D. Fla. May 10, 2001). Defendants filed objections to this R&R.\n\nIn the meantime, on March 23, 2001, plaintiff Leslie F. moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin defendants from terminating her foster care services. Leslie F. had turned eighteen but was still enrolled in high school.  On April 30, 2001, the Court (District Judge Federico A. Moreno) denied the requested preliminary injunction. The Court held that, inter alia, Leslie F. lacked standing because she had not yet had her benefits terminated (and thus had not suffered an injury in fact), and that her claims were not yet ripe. Plaintiff appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, while also seeking a temporary injunction from the District Court pending appeal. The Court (Judge Moreno) again denied plaintiff's request, noting that defendants had agreed to continue to provide services for 45 days or until the Eleventh Circuit ruled. Bonnie L. ex rel. Hadsock v. Bush, No. 00-2116-CIV-MORENO, 2001 WL 1840845 (S.D. Fla. June 8, 2001). Plaintiff subsequently appealed this ruling as well. The two appeals were consolidated by the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nOn October 15, 2001, the defendants filed a supplemental motion to dismiss. The defendants argued that the action was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and that the Court must abstain under the Younger v. Harris doctrine. At this time, the defendants' objections to the Magistrate's Report and Recommendation denying defendants' motion to dismiss was still under consideration by the Court.\n\nOn December 4, 2001, the District Court (Judge Moreno) granted defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court held that plaintiffs' claims under the ASFA were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), and that certain of plaintiffs' Title VI claims were barred by Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001) and Harris v. James, 127 F.3d 993 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that, by reading Sandoval in pari materia with Harris, the disparate impact regulations do not contain a substantive private right under disparate impact regulations). The Court also abstained under Younger from considering plaintiffs' substantive and procedural due process claims, as well as plaintiffs' claims under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments for plaintiffs not in extended foster care. And while the Court did not dismiss all claims with respect to those plaintiffs, the Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice due to plaintiffs' failure to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. The Court also set a deadline within which plaintiffs could file a second amended complaint. Bonnie L. ex rel. Hadsock v. Bush, 180 F. Supp. 2d 1321 (S.D. Fla. 2001). Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nOn February 14, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit dismissed plaintiffs' appeal regarding the preliminary injunction because the parties had reached a partial settlement agreement. Per the terms of the settlement agreement, certain of the named plaintiffs released defendants from all claims, while others released defendants only from their EPSDT and Title VI claims. Those plaintiffs continued to press their constitutional and ASFA claims by appealing the District Court's December 4 dismissal to the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nOn May 8, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and vacated in part the District Court's order granting defendants' motion to dismiss. The Eleventh Circuit (Judge Carnes) held that (1) certain named plaintiffs' claims had become moot; (2) the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs' statutory claims, as those statutes do not give rise to enforceable rights; and (3) the district court did not abuse its discretion in abstaining under Younger. The Eleventh Circuit only vacated the district court's opinion and remanded with instructions regarding certain named plaintiffs, whose claims were moot or who lacked standing. Thus, this appeal affirmed the district court in all substantive respects and ended the case. 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255 (11th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 984.

{"document": "In December 2001, a federal grand jury returned a 36-count indictment against Tyson Foods, Inc., the world's largest poultry processor, and several individuals, charging the defendants with conspiring to smuggle undocumented aliens into the U.S. and employing them at Tyson's chicken processing plants throughout the country.  Shortly after the criminal indictment, plaintiffs filed a nationwide class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee against Tyson and several of its top management personnel, alleging civil violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., and the Immigration Reform and Control Act (\"IRCA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a), et seq. Plaintiffs alleged that Tyson engaged in a massive scheme to hire undocumented immigrants for the express purpose of depressing employee wages. The scheme allegedly involved the use of temporary employment agencies to recruit and lure undocumented immigrants from Mexico to work in its chicken plants.  Plaintiffs further alleged that the scheme consisted of what plaintiffs termed a \"willful blindness policy,\" which included management turning a blind eye to obviously fake work papers and ignoring other factors that suggested that the workers it hired were not legally entitled to work in the U.S. The civil case was initially assigned to Judge R. Allan Edgar. \n\nTyson and its officers responded by moving to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, asserting that plaintiffs' RICO claims were preempted by the National Labor Relations Act.  Tyson also asserted that plaintiffs' complaint failed to state a claim, in that employee wages were the product of Union collective bargaining and therefore could not have resulted from the hiring of undocumented workers. The District Court (Chief Judge Edgar) granted the motion and dismissed the case for failure to state a claim. <i>Trollinger v. Tyson Foods, Inc.</i>, 214 F. Supp. 2d 840 (E.D.

So for more current information, see <a href=\"https://healthyelections-case-tracker.stanford.edu/\"> their tracker</a>.</b> COVID-19 summary: This case sought emergency voting measures related to COVID-19 for the Florida presidential primary on March 17, 2020.  These were denied, but a motion for measures relating to future elections remains pending. <hr>\n\nThe Florida presidential primary occurred on March 17, 2020. At that time, Florida had reported 149 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the State of Florida had taken numerous restrictions in response to COVID-19. Universities sent students home, Supervisors of Elections closed or moved numerous polling stations, and numerous individuals were in quarantine. Concerned about the potential large-scale voter disenfranchisement due to COVID-19 restrictions, on March 16, 2020, Dream Defenders, the New Florida Majority Education Fund, Organize Florida, and several individuals prevented from voting due to COVID-19 restrictions, filed this lawsuit against the Governor of Florida in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The plaintiffs sought emergency injunctive and declaratory relief that would order the state to implement additional voting measures and enjoin it from enforcing the existing voting deadlines. They alleged that the State of Florida “failed to take reasonable emergency measures” for voter participation, such as extending deadlines for absentee ballots and expanding vote-by-mail options. Represented by the National Center for Law and Economic Justice, DEMOS, and LatinoJustice PRLDEF, the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit under § 1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. Specifically, they alleged that the defendants deprived the plaintiffs of their opportunity to vote in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendment and failed to provide reasonable accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.\n\nImmediately, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. They asked the court to order the state to expand access to vote-by-mail options, extend deadlines, permit curbside voting, and communicate these changes to Floridians. \n\nThe defendants did not respond to the emergency motion; however, noting that the temporary restraining order had been filed at 11:16 pm on the eve of the primary, Judge Robert Hinkle denied the motion on March 17, 2020, stating that granting the order would be “adverse to the public interest.”  \n\nThe plaintiffs renewed their request later that day, discarding the request for curbside voting, but continuing to request extended access to vote-by-mail and absentee options. On March 18, 2020 Judge Hinkle denied this motion with respect to the March 17 primary. He noted it “would be adverse to the public interest to enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction blocking the Secretary of State and Supervisors of Elections from processing the results of the March 17 presidential primary in accordance with the governing Florida statutes.” \n\nThe motion for a preliminary injunction with respect to future elections remained pending.

{"document": "On Apr. 6, 2016, two noncitizens—a Mexican citizen and an asylum-seeking Honduran national, both detained pending immigration removal hearings—brought this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Represented by private counsel and the ACLU, the plaintiffs sued the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) and the Fifth and Eighth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that they were kept in detention pending removal proceedings, despite having been granted release on bond after having been found not to pose any significant flight risk or danger to the community, because they could not afford to pay the cash bond. \n\nThe plaintiffs’ class-action complaint challenged the federal practice of detaining noncitizens for failure to post cash bond without considering the noncitizen’s financial resources, or the availability of alternative forms of bond or other conditions of supervision which would enable the detainee’s release. The plaintiffs moved for class certification on Apr. 22, 2016. The proposed class was specified as all individuals detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), on a bond set by an ICE officer or an Immigration Judge in the Central District of California. \n\nThe case was assigned to Judge Jesus G. Bernal. On June 10, 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss this case. On Nov. 20, 2016, Judge Bernal denied the defendants’ motion and granted the plaintiffs’ motions for class certification and class-wide preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on the merits of their claim. The preliminary injunction order required that the defendants develop and apply guidelines requiring officers to Immigration Judges to take into account a noncitizen detainee’s financial ability to pay a bond, to refrain from setting cash bonds at amounts greater than what was required to ensure appearance, and to consider alternative forms of supervision when determining conditions of release. 2016 WL 7116611 (C.D. Cal. 2016).\n\nOn Dec. 12, 2016, the defendants appealed the District Court’s preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On the same day, the defendants moved ex parte to stay proceedings related to the preliminary injunction pending resolution of the appeal. On Dec. 28, 2016, Judge Bernal denied the motion to stay. On Jan. 4, 2017, however, the Ninth Circuit granted the defendants’ motion to stay the District Court’s order pending appeal.\n\nThe defendants then filed their opening brief in the Ninth Circuit on Feb. 1, 2017. They argued that the District Court had erred in issuing the preliminary injunction because federal courts lacked jurisdiction (under federal statutes and because the plaintiffs had not exhausted administrative remedies); because the plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional claims were unlikely to succeed (because ability to pay is not a primary factor in determining bond); and because current bond determination proceedings did not violate noncitizens' constitutional rights (because they received full and fair hearings, and because the primary purpose of bond was to ensure that the noncitizen had an incentive to appear at future removal proceedings rather than abscond).\n\nThe plaintiffs answered in the Ninth Circuit on Mar. 1, 2017. They argued that federal courts had jurisdiction; that the preliminary injunction applied only to individuals already found eligible for release, whose bond was to be determined, and that the INA should be construed to prevent the defendants' bond-setting policies from violating the Constitution; and that the plaintiffs continued to suffer irreparable harm from their detention. \n\nAlso in Mar. 2017 in the Ninth Circuit, several amici briefs were filed on behalf of the plaintiffs, including by retired Board of Immigration Appeals members and Immigration Judges, and by the American Bar Association. \n\nOn June 30, 2017, the District Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, and consolidated this case with another, <i>Marvin Rodriguez Aroche v. Jason Park</i>, No. 8:17-cv-00367 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 1, 2017).\n\nThe Ninth Circuit held oral argument on July 11, 2017 and issued a decision on Oct. 2, 2017, affirming the District Court's class-wide preliminary injunction. 872 F.3d 976 (9th Cir. 2017). \n\nIn the opinion, the Court found that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by requiring immigration officials making bond decisions to consider, inter alia, detainees' financial ability to obtain bond and alternative conditions of release. The plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their Fifth Amendment Due Process claim, because \"[s]etting a bond amount without considering financial circumstances or alternative conditions of release undermines the connection between the bond and the legitimate purpose of ensuring the non-citizen’s presence at future hearings.\" The plaintiffs had established a likelihood of irreparable harm because \"they are likely to be unconstitutionally detained for an indeterminate period of time.\" Finally, the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs because \"any additional administrative costs to the government are far outweighed by the considerable harm to Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights in the absence of the injunction\" and because \"[t]he public interest benefits from an injunction that ensures that individuals are not deprived of their liberty and held in immigration detention because of bonds established by a likely unconstitutional process.\"\n\nThe Ninth Circuit also lifted the stay of the District Court's preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\nThe defendants were given until Jan. 2, 2018 to petition the Ninth Circuit for a panel or en banc rehearing, but they filed no petition.\n\nIn the District Court on Nov. 21, 2017, Judge Bernal approved the parties' joint stipulation for an extension of time to implement the part of his Nov. 10, 2016 order granting a class-wide preliminary injunction. The defendants were required to update the plaintiffs by Feb. 16, 2018 about their progress in meeting the injunction requirements.\n\nOn Dec. 1, 2017, Magistrate Judge Kenly Kato granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel production of documents and to obtain fees. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 198255 (C.D. Cal. 2017). On Jan. 3, 2018, Magistrate Judge Kato granted $22,820 in fees regarding this motion.\n\nAs discovery got underway, Magistrate Judge Kato decided that a Special Master should be appointed to consider the parties' discovery disputes and facilitate the timely production of documents. Rosalyn Chapman was appointed Special Master on May 23, 2018. The parties then engaged in extensive discovery over the next year.\n\nOn May 16, 2019, the parties made a joint request to the District Court, asking for this case to be referred for a settlement conference. Judge Bernal granted the request on May 21 and referred the case to Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler.\n\nThe case is ongoing.\n", "summary": "In 2016, noncitizens detained pending immigration removal proceedings brought this class action, alleging a federal practice of detaining noncitizens solely on the basis of indigence, by failing to take into account their ability to pay bond or to consider alternative means of supervision to ensure appearance.

The parties have since engaged in extensive discovery, but jointly requested to be referred for a settlement conference in May 2019. The case is ongoing."}
{"document": "A trans woman housed in a mens' prison in Texas filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas on June 8, 2015 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiff represented herself in the trial court, and she was represented on appeal by Stephen Braga, a law professor at the University of Virginia. The case was assigned to Judge Robert Pitman. \n\nThe plaintiff alleged that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's blanket ban on gender affirmation surgery violated the Eighth Amendment because it amounted to deliberate indifference to her medical needs. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that, while incarcerated, her primary care physician was not adequately trained on transgender care and failed to provide her with treatment consistent with the WPATH standards of care. He refused to provide her with an individualized assessment or treatment plan, which denied her access to various forms of treatment that may have been medically necessary. The plaintiff had on several occasions used the prison's formal grievance system to protest this lack of care as well as the blanket policy to no avail. \n\nThe defendants named in this case were the TDCJ Director, the primary care physician who refused to provide the plaintiff with treatment for her gender dysphoria, and and unknown University of Texas Medical Branch official. The Director moved for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim. On June 8, 2015, the district court granted this motion, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint in its entirety. \n\nThe plaintiff filed an appeal in the Fifth Circuit pro se on September 16, 2016. On October 10, 2017, Professor Stephen Bega began representing her. Judges Smith, Ho and Barksdale heard the case and released an opinion on March 29, 2019 (920 F.3d 212). The majority opinion, written by Judge Ho, held that there had been no Eighth Amendment violation, characterizing the WPATH standards as simply one side of a contested debate rather than the widely accepted standard in the medical field. Judge Ho held that because the doctor and prison administration had merely chosen a side, they were not demonstrating the malicious intent necessary to make out a claim of deliberate indifference.\n\nJudge Barksdale's dissent, on the other hand, took issue with both the summary judgment procedure used by the lower court and the majority's assessment of the merits. Specifically, he disagreed with the majority's characterization of WPATH, noting that it had become a widely accepted norm that had been acknowledged as such in both the Fourth and Seventh Circuits. Judge Barksdale also questioned whether authorities cited by the majority supported its use of he/him/his pronouns to refer to the plaintiff.\n\nThe plaintiff filed a petition for certiorari (an appeal) in the Supreme Court of the United States on July 1, 2019. The Supreme Court announced on December 9, 2019 that they had declined to hear the case (140 S. Ct. 653). The case is now closed. \n\nWhile this case was still ongoing, the plaintiff filed another lawsuit alleging retaliation in response to pursuing these claims. For more information, see <i>Gibson v.

{"document": "On November 18, 2002, HIV positive inmates at the Limestone Correctional Facility in Capshaw, Alabama filed a class action lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court Northern District of Alabama to challenge their treatment and conditions of confinement.  Plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Center for Human Rights and private civil rights attorneys, alleged that they were denied adequate medical treatment and were subjected to deplorable living conditions.  Defendants included officials of the Alabama Department of Corrections [DOC] and NaphCare, Inc., a private health care company that contracted with the DOC to provide healthcare services at Limestone.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.\n\nFollowing plaintiffs' lawsuit, an audit report addressing the medical treatment provided to HIV positive inmates confined at Limestone was prepared by Moore and Associates, an independent entity that was hired to assess the performance of NaphCare under its contract with the DOC.  The audit report noted many deficiencies in the care provided and found that the number of AIDS related deaths at Limestone (reportedly 36 deaths from 1992 to 2002) was remarkably high compared to averages reported by other correctional institutions.   Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on April 2, 2003, which cited various findings and the conclusion reported by Moore and Associates in its audit report. NaphCare moved to dismiss.\n\nThe District Court Judge Karon O. Bowdre certified the case as a class action on January 27, 2004.  NaphCare was dismissed from the case without prejudice, with the dismissal contingent on NaphCare complying with all standing discovery orders.  The case was then referred to mediation.  The parties eventually arrived at a settlement.\n\nOn May 6, 2004, the parties filed a joint motion to approve the Settlement Agreement.  A fairness hearing was held on May 26, 2004 before Magistrate Judge John E. Ott.  Judge Ott issued a report and recommendation that the Court adopt the Settlement Agreement.  The District Court issued a memorandum opinion and order approving the Settlement Agreement on June 24, 2004.  \n\nThe Settlement Agreement specified numerous changes to be made by the DOC relative to the delivery of health care at Limestone, including the hiring of an HIV Specialist to provide treatment to HIV infected prisoners and a full time registered nurse to serve as the \"HIV Coordinator\" in charge of infection control.  An additional medical doctor was to be hired to treat non-HIV positive inmates.  The Agreement was set to terminate two years after its final approval.  The District Court retained jurisdiction over the case to enforce the agreement and appointed Magistrate Judge Ott as Special Master to oversee the remedial phase.  Dr. Joseph Bick was appointed as the independent medical consultant.  By separate agreement of the parties, attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $410,000.00 were awarded to class counsel.\n\nDuring the remediation phase, plaintiffs moved for an order of contempt for the DOC's alleged non-compliance with the Settlement Agreement.  In January 2006, The District Court (Judge Bowdre) denied the motion as moot and ordered Dr. Bick to conduct an audit at Limestone in November 2006 and to issue a written report on his findings.  The parties were advised to file any motions to terminate or extend the Settlement Agreement within 30 days of its June 26, 2006 termination date. \n\nOn April 5, 2006 Judge Ott issued an order preserving the confidentiality of all medical records incorporated in \"mortality reviews\"provided to Dr. Bick and extended the confidentiality requirements in perpetuity. On April 26, 2007 the State of Alabama was ordered to pay Dr. Bick $4,000 for his last quarterly evaluation.

{"document": "On June 5, 2017, a male Louisiana detainee filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. He had been arrested and detained after being charged with felony theft and was unable to post the $375 bond to a for-profit bonding agent to clear his $3000 bail. The plaintiff sued the Sheriff, County Commissioner, and Chief Judge for the 15th Judicial District of Louisiana under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201. Represented by Civil Rights Corps, MacArthur Justice Center, and Loyola University School of Law, the plaintiff sought to represent a class of all arrestees who were or would be detained in that state district--which covered Acadia, Lafayette, and Vermillon Parishes--for any amount of time after an arrest because they were unable to pay money bail. He claimed that the district scheme of setting bail amounts without further inquiry into a person's ability to pay violated his Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. He sought an injunction, declaratory relief, and attorney's fees and costs.\n\nThis case was referred to Magistrate Judge Patrick Hanna and Judge Robert G. James. Judge James recused himself and the case was reassigned to Judge Elizabeth E. Foote. \n\nThe defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. They also argued that the claim was moot because the plaintiff was no longer in jail. On July 20, the case was stayed as the parties engaged in settlement talks under Judge Hanna's orders. After several months of unsuccessful settlement talks, the stay was lifted even though settlement discussions continued. The defendants claimed there was nothing to settle and the plaintiff claimed irreparable harm was ongoing.\n\nOn December 6, 2017, Judge Hanna filed a Report and Recommendation in response to the Commissioner's motion to dismiss. The report recommended that the motion should be granted with respect to plaintiff's equal protection claims and due process claims against the County Judge. The Judge also recommended that the motion be denied to the extent that it requested dismissal of due process claims against the Commissioner.\n\nOn December 11, 2017, Judge Hanna filed a second Report and Recommendation in response to the Sheriff's motion to dismiss. The report recommended the motion be denied with respect to subject matter jurisdiction claims because the claim was not moot and Younger abstention did not apply. However, the plaintiff had requested relief that could not be granted, and so Judge Hanna recommended dismissal. The plaintiff objected to both of these reports and sought oral argument before Judge Foote. On January 12, 2018, Judge Foote granted a hearing. \n\nOn February 14, 2018, the plaintiff and an intervenor filed a motion to intervene or to consolidate the case with the intervenor's individual case, 6:18-cv-00159, with this case.

Specifically, the Sheriff revised his policies and procedures governing the Sheriff’s Tracking Offender Program (S.T.O.P), which determines a detainee’s eligibility for these programs. On March 27, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the supplemental complaint and original complaint for failure to state a claim. \n\nDiscovery then followed. On April 12, Judge Foote granted the plaintiff’s motion to intervene and denied the motion to consolidate cases. On June 28, 2018, the defendant filed a motion for sanction regarding the plaintiff’s supplemental complaint.\n\nOn August 28, 2018, Judge Hanna filed a Report and Recommendations. She recommended that the Sheriff’s motion to dismiss filed on March 27 should be granted in part and denied in part, and that the re-urged first motion to dismiss the original complaint should be granted. 2018 WL 6036911. The next day, Judge Hanna filed an additional Report and Recommendations, recommending that the motion for sanctions be denied. 2018 WL 6028683.\n\nOn October 26, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment against the Sheriff but later withdrew this motion.

Plaintiffs claimed that defendant violated the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause by keeping them in jail post-arrest when they could not afford the bail set by defendant. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant’s practice of regularly setting a $2,500 minimum financial condition, without considering arrestees' inability to pay or other non-financial alternatives, violated plaintiffs’ fundamental rights.  Plaintiffs further claimed that defendant violated the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause by holding a dual role of determining pre-trial release conditions and managing the court's finances, thereby creating an institutional conflict of interest and depriving plaintiffs of a neutral tribunal. By requiring detainees pay their bail amounts as a commercial surety instead of in cash, plaintiffs allege that defendant enforced a mechanism whereby bail payments generated revenue for the court and directly benefited defendant’s office. Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgement. \n\nThe next day, plaintiffs moved to certify their class for all similarly situated detainees who were unable to pay the financial condition imposed by defendant as a requirement for their immediate release. \n\nIn July 2017, defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint for two reasons. First, the defendant claimed that that putative class members whose criminal proceedings had ended no longer had standing and were therefore unlikely to be injured. Secondly, the defendant claimed that because there were ongoing state court criminal proceedings against named plaintiffs and other class members, a federal proceeding would interfere with the state court’s ability to handle these proceedings. \n\nOn August 25, 2017, Judge Eldon E. Fallon denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, reasoning that there were still named and proposed class members with ongoing criminal cases who had ongoing and actual injuries. The court also found that the plaintiffs did not have an adequate opportunity to raise issues of bond policies in the relevant state courts, and so the issue of federal proceedings interfering with state court did not apply. \n\nOn November 7, 2017, the defendant again moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that the defendant magistrate judge was not the proper defendant on plaintiffs’ claim of unconstitutionality. \n\nOver the next several months, the parties engaged in settlement talks but did not reach an agreement. The court denied the defendant's second motion to dismiss in December, 2017.\n\nOn March 16, 2018, the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The class was certified as: \"all presumptively innocent arrestees who are now before or will come before Defendant Magistrate Judge of Orleans Parish Criminal District Court for proceedings concerning pretrial release or detention and who are unable to pay the financial condition that Defendant imposes as a requirement for their immediate release.\" 2018 WL 1365809.\n\nOn August 06, 2018, Judge Eldon E. Fallon granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and provided the declaratory relief requested. The Court stated that the defendant's bail procedures had not provided notice of the importance of the issue of the criminal defendant’s ability to pay, and consideration of alternative conditions of release, or application of a legal standard in the determination of the necessity of pretrial detention. Hence, these procedures violated plaintiffs’ procedural due process rights.  On August 14, 2018, Judge Fallon issued an order granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and providing declaratory relief as follows:\n(i) in the context of hearings to determine pretrial detention Due Process requires: (a) an inquiry into the arrestee’s ability to pay, including notice of the importance of this issue and the ability to be heard on this issue; (b) consideration of alternative conditions of release, including findings on the record applying the clear and convincing standard and explaining why an arrestee does not qualify for alternative conditions of release; and (c) representative counsel;\n(ii) defendant's institutional incentives created a substantial and unconstitutional conflict of interest when he determined their ability to pay bail and set the amount of that bail.\n\nThe defendant filed a notice of appeal on August 21, 2018, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. (Docket No. 18-30954). The defendant appealed only the determination that his setting of bonds that help fund his court violated due process. \n\nOn June 13, 2019, Judge Fallon entered an Order governing the protocol that the defendant will use in determining the conditions of pre-trial release for arrestees. The order directed the defendant to consider the need for pre-trial release or detention based on the flight risk and/or danger posed by the arrestee. The defendant must also consider whether there are any nonfinancial conditions of release that would satisfy concerns of public safety and/or future appearances at court. The order also instructed that if a financial condition for release is set and the arrestee cannot meet it, the court must provide clear and convincing evidence that the financial condition is necessary to guard against risks of flight and danger to public safety. \n\nOn August 29, 2019, the appeals court affirmed the decision of the district court (Circuit Judges Patrick Higginbotham, Edith Jones, and Gregg Costa). See 937 F.3d 525 (2019). The appeals court concluded that the defendant had a direct and personal interest in maintaining the fiscal health of his court through the generation of bonds fees. The defendant also held a dual role because he generated and appropriated funds for the court through his bail procedures. The appeals court found that the combination of the dual role and personal interest in benefitting from bond fees “may make the magistrate ‘partisan to maintain the high level of contribution’,” thus violating due process. \n\nOn September 12, 2019, the defendant filed a motion for rehearing en banc in the appeals court.

{"document": "On April 29, 2019, the Middlesex County District Attorney, Suffolk County District Attorney, Committee for Public Counsel Services (“CPCS”), and the Chelsea Collaborative, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and several officials under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), and the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1226(a), 1357(a). The plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, claiming violations of common-law privilege against civil arrests in courthouses and the Tenth Amendment. The plaintiffs alleged that in 2017, ICE authorized a nationwide campaign to target state courthouses as sites for civil-immigration enforcement. The plaintiffs further alleged that this policy undermined the administration of justice in Massachusetts, as many permanent residents refused to appear in court out of fear of ICE interference.  \n\nOn April 29, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction that sought to enjoin ICE from authorizing and conducting civil arrests on parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts courthouses on official business. The plaintiffs alleged that by authorizing civil arrests in courthouses, ICE ignored the well-settled common-law privilege against such civil arrests and exceeded its statutory jurisdiction under the Immigrant and Nationality Act. Thus, the practice is unlawful and should be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act. While the motion included other claims, the plaintiffs sought preliminary injunctive relief only on this claim.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, the defendants filed an Opposition to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. In the Opposition, the defendants disputed the existence of a common-law privilege against civil arrest in courthouses. Furthermore, the defendants argued that even if the common-law privilege existed, Congress erased the privilege when it passed the INA. \n\nOn June 20, 2019, Judge Indira Talwani granted the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction and issued a memorandum. See 382 F. Supp. 3d 142 (2019). Judge Talwani found that plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit, were likely to succeed on the merits of their Administrative Procedure Act claim, and the injunction was of public interest. Thus, the defendants were enjoined from implementing the Courthouse Civil Arrest Directive and from civilly arresting parties, witnesses, and others attending Massachusetts courthouses on official business while they are going to, attending, or leaving the courthouse.\n\nDefendants appealed; the appeal is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n", "summary": "In April 2019, two District Attorneys in Massachusetts and two public interest organizations filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

(Title VII). The DOJ asked the court for injunctive relief, alleging that the defendant had violated Title VII by discriminating against applicants for employment on the basis of race by bypassing higher ranked African-American applicants in favor of lower ranked white applicants.\n\nThe complaint alleged that the Alabama Personnel Department discriminated on the basis of race by hiring lower ranked white applicants over higher ranked African-American applicants.  A no-bypass rule was instituted by the Alabama Personnel Department. On July 28, 1970, United States brought this action to enforce the federal requirement that state personnel engaged in administration of federally financed grant-in-aid programs be recruited, hired and promoted or demoted on merit basis, without discrimination on the grounds of race or color (317 F.Supp 1079, D.C.Ala. 1970). The District Court (Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr.) ordered: that the affected African-American applicants be offered the first available position with the rate of pay he would have and seniority rights; that African-American applicants be appointed to positions other than custodial, domestic, laborer or laboratory aide, unless another position is filled; that the defendants not appoint or offer a position to a lower-ranking white applicant over a higher-ranking available African-American applicant.\n\nIn May of 2002, in order to determine whether the no-bypass rule was still necessary, the state defendants hired statistical experts to examine the racial composition of the Alabama workforce as well as the racial patterns of recent selections in the workforce. \n\nOn February 11, 2003, a white employee of the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADC) who had claimed that he had been denied a promotion because of the no-bypass rule, moved to intervene. He alleged, among other things, that the no-bypass rule was unconstitutional and must be modified or ended. \n\nOn February 11, 2003, the United States and the state defendants began discussions on the results of the statistical analysis and proposed to terminate the no-bypass rule, as the problems, aimed at by the no-bypass rule, were remedied. On March 20, 2003, the United States and the state defendants entered a joint motion to terminate the no-bypass rule. \n\nOn May 22, 2003, representatives of African-American employees of the State of Alabama moved to intervene to oppose termination or modification of the no-bypass rule and to otherwise enforce it. On January 20, 2004, the Court (Judge Myron Thompson) granted both the white employee of ADC and the African-American employees the right to intervene under the permissive intervention rule. On February 28, 2004, the ADC employee filed a motion to terminate the no-bypass rule.  \n\nOn April 21, 2004, the white employee of the ADC filed a motion to certify class.

On May 20, 2005, the Court (Judge Myron Thompson) issued an order, treating the joint motion to terminate the no-bypass rule as a motion for preliminary injunction, and granted both the motion as well as ADC employee's preliminary injunction motion. The court suspended the no-bypass rule effective no later than June 20, 2005, pending final resolution of the challenges to the rule. The court reasoned that the special change in circumstances warranted the suspension of the rule. \n\nOn June 1, 2005 the ADC employee filed a motion for interim award of attorneys' fees. On September 09, 2005  the white employee filed a motion for summary judgment. On the same day, the state defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the joint motion to terminate no-bypass rule.\n\nOn June 30, 2006, the Court (Judge Myron Thompson) issued a judgment, permanently terminating the no-bypass rule. The court reasoned that the no-bypass rule was no longer an appropriate tool, and that there was no longer a fit between the practices and the rule. United States v. Director Alabama Personnel Department, 444 F.Supp.2d 1192 (M.D. Ala. 2006).\n\nOn September 17, 2007, the Court granted the plaintiff-intervenor's motion for attorney's fees to the extent that plaintiff-intervenor recovered $61,499.70 for fees and expenses.  The state defendants filed an appeal against the order granting attorney's fees to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\nOn July 1, 2008, the plaintiff-intervenor filed a motion for attorney's fees on appeal, which was denied without prejudice on the same day.\n\nOn August 19, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit issued a judgment per curiam, affirming the District Court's grant of attorney's fees to the plaintiff-intervenor.

{"document": "This case was severed from <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15529\">West v. City of Hitchcock</a>, 3:16-cv-00309 (S.D. Tex.). The case originally pursued claims against the Cities of Hitchcock and Santa Fe at the same time, but the court severed the two on September 19, 2018.\n\nThe original complaint, filed on November 3, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, involved three individuals under threat of being jailed for failure to pay fines to the City of Santa Fe. The plaintiffs sued the City of Santa Fe, the Municipal Judge, and the Chief of Police under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the defendants run a modern-day debtors' prison to raise revenue for the City. They claimed that city officials have colluded on an unconstitutional two-tiered system of justice by which the City and Municipal Judge agreed to raise the costs of the traffic and other misdemeanor fines to boost revenue and the City extracts payments from local residents. Police officers regularly jail people who fail to pay their fines without giving them access to a lawyer or the chance to mount a legal defense, nor are they given the opportunity to see a judge for the constitutionally mandated hearing on their ability to pay. Moreover, the police chief makes jail intolerable, giving detainees too little food to eat and depriving them of medical care. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, the plaintiffs asked the court for injunctive and declaratory relief, damages, and attorneys fees. They also sought class certification.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the revenue-generating scheme begins with Municipal Court proceedings, which its jurisdiction is limited to tickets for class C misdemeanors. These offenses are defined by Texas law as \"nonjailable,\" \"fine only\" offenses, punishable by a fine up to $500. For an individual unable to make timely payments in full, the Municipal Court issues a \"capias pro fine\" warrant for failure to pay a fine. Individuals who have a capias pro fine have two options: pay in full or turn themselves in to the police. Police also search for people subject to capias pro fine warrants, sometimes arresting people at their homes in front of family, friends, and neighbors. Though police have the option of taking such individuals before a court, they do not. Instead, they transfer them to the police chief and book them into jail where they will be held until they pay their debt in full or satisfy the fines with \"jail credit.\"\n\nOnce in jail, the allegations continued, individuals are subjected to unsafe conditions without proper food. The complaint terms this the \"Hungry Man policy,\" and alleges that jailed individuals are fed one Pop Tart for breakfast, one Pop Tart for lunch, and a frozen meal, such as a Hungry Man meal, for dinner. This amounts to only about 750 calories a day, which is less than half of the calories the average sedentary adult requires, and less than a third of the calories sedentary young men require.\n\nJudge George C Hanks, Jr. denied class certification without prejudice on September 18, 2017, without providing a detailed reason in the order. On October 11, 2017, one of the named plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed his claims. The other two plaintiffs continued with the same case at this point in time.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 23, 2017, adding a magistrate judge, in his individual capacity, and the Chief of Police, in his official capacity, as defendants. \n\nThe case was temporarily assigned to Magistrate Judge Andrew Edison on June 1, 2018. The Magistrate Judge provided a recommendation against granting the defendant's various motions to dismiss, saying that all plaintiffs in the case had standing and that the injuries alleged in the case amounted to civil rights violations. Though he did not explicitly recommend severing the claims against Hitchcock and Santa Fe at this point, the Magistrate Judge discussed each plaintiff's claims against their respective cities separately. This likely influenced Judge Hanks's decision to sever the two cases when he adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation on September 19.\n\nDiscovery continued on the case in 2018 and 2019. In May and June of 2019, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, and the plaintiff filed a motion opposing it. Judge Hanks scheduled a jury trial for August 26, 2019, and the parties submitted witness and exhibit lists in anticipation of the hearing. However, on August 2, the plaintiff moved for court-ordered mediation, which the Judge granted on August 5. \n\nMagistrate Judge Andrew Edison oversaw the mediation, which occurred on August 13, 2019. The following day, the parties entered into a settlement agreement; the terms of the agreement were not publicly disclosed. The order dismissing the case from August 14 noted that if either party filed a motion before September 13, 2019 saying that the agreement could not be implemented, the case would close.

{"document": "On January 28, 2019, several arrestees from St. Louis filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. None of the four named plaintiffs could afford to pay their monetary release conditions, which ranged from $10,000 to $30,000, and were thus incarcerated at one of the City’s two detention centers without access to showers or medical care and forced to endure allegedly unconscionable conditions, including extreme heat and cold, rat and cockroach infestations, mold, and abuse by guards. \n\nThe Plaintiffs sued the City of St. Louis, its officers, and judges responsible for setting release conditions in the 22nd Judicial Circuit Court of Missouri under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Declaratory Judgment Act. The Plaintiffs alleged violations of their Equal Protection and Due Process rights through the Defendants’ policy of setting arbitrary monetary release conditions that exceeded an individual’s ability to pay and by detaining the Plaintiffs solely on their inability to pay. They claimed that holding the Plaintiffs in pretrial detention violated their Substantive Due Process rights by failing to consider each detainee’s particular likelihood to appear and their threats of danger to the community. Finally, they claimed that the Defendants violated the Plaintiffs’ Procedural Due Process rights by detaining them for weeks before giving them a hearing or opportunity to challenge or modify their release conditions. Represented by a collection of public interest organizations including ArchCity Defenders, the Advancement Project, Civil Rights Corps, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, the Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to permanently enjoin the Defendants from implementing a wealth-based pretrial detention system. They sought class certification as “all arrestees who are or will be detained in the Medium Security Institution (referred to as ‘the Workhouse’) or the City Justice Center (‘CJC’), operated by the City of St. Louis, post-arrest because they are unable to afford to pay a monetary release condition.” In addition, the Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order requiring the Sheriff and Commissioner of Corrections to release the Plaintiffs unless they were provided a hearing. The case was ultimately assigned to Judge Audrey G. Fleissig.\n\nOn January 30, 2019, the parties reached a Stipulation Agreement (which obviated the Plaintiffs’ need for a hearing on the request for a temporary restraining order). The Agreement provided that a Judge of the 22nd Judicial Circuit would hold a hearing for each Named Plaintiff regarding his conditions of release before the end of the day on January 31, 2019. The Agreement also provided that the Defendant Judges would comply with the Missouri Supreme Court Rules regarding the conditions of release, as well as a number of procedural requirements, including (1) allowing Plaintiffs to present evidence and contest evidence, (2) having the hearings on the record in open court, and (3) maintaining and making the records available for review. The next day, the Defendant Judges held bond hearings for the named Plaintiffs. Two were released without bond, with other conditions. Two did not receive a reduction in bond. Plaintiff’s counsel posted bail for the two detained Plaintiffs, and on February 5, 2019, they were also released.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, the Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the Defendant Jail Commissioner from enforcing any bail order that operated as a de facto detention order due to an arrestee’s inability to pay (unless accompanied by a determination that there are no less restrictive alternatives to ensure the arrestee’s future court appearance and public safety). Specifically, the Plaintiffs sought the following procedural protections:\n<blockquote>1. notice of the nature and significance of the financial information required,\n2. a prompt hearing, on the record, regarding the person’s inability to pay,\n3. legal counsel at such hearings,\n4. findings on the record as to whether the person has the ability to pay, and\n5. clear and convincing evidence supporting the necessity of detention.\n</blockquote>Shortly after, the City Defendants and the Defendant Judges separately filed motions to dismiss the case on March 1, 2019. The City Defendants asserted that they had no authority to establish bail conditions and no policy or custom of silencing arrestees in initial appearances. The Defendant Judges asserted theories of immunity and abstention. \n\nOn June 11, 2019, the Court issued an opinion granting class certification, denying the Defendants’ motions to dismiss, and granting the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. 2019 WL 2437026. With regard to class certification, the Court decided that the class met all the requirements under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; furthermore, the Court held that although the named Plaintiffs had received bond hearings and were no longer detained, this did not moot the claims of the unnamed members of the class. The class was certified as “all arrestees who are or will be detained in the Medium Security Institution (the Workhouse) or the City Justice Center (CJC), operated by the City of St. Louis, post-arrest because they are unable to afford to pay a monetary release condition,” and the Plaintiffs’ counsel was appointed counsel for the class. With regard to the Defendant Judges’ motion to dismiss, the Court found that the Plaintiffs could seek a declaratory judgment against a judge in his or her official capacity under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and that the Plaintiffs could seek injunctive relief because they did not necessarily have an adequate remedy at law. With regard to the City’s motion to dismiss, the Court found that the Plaintiffs had successfully stated a claim for municipal liability under <i>Monell</i> by alleging facts to draw an inference that the constitutional violation occurred as a result of the City’s alleged policy or custom to inform detained individuals that they are not allowed to speak during their initial appearances. Finally, with regard to the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court concluded that the motion was meritorious, finding that the Plaintiffs had a high probability of success on their claim and the prolonged incarceration would result in irreparable harm to the Plaintiff class.\n\nBoth the City Defendants and the Defendant Judges separately appealed the preliminary injunction order to the Eighth Circuit on June 13, 2019, and the docket numbers 19-2251 and 19-2254 were assigned.\n\nThe Defendants also moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending the appeal. On June 17, 2019, the District Court denied the motion to stay the preliminary injunction. 2019 WL 2509792. However, the District Court granted a limited extension of time to conduct hearings for the approximately 700 arrestees already in detention. The parties were to confer and submit a joint plan for hearings for the backlog detainees. In the meantime, Judge Fleissig ordered the Defendant Judges to conduct 30 hearings a day, Monday through Wednesday. \n\nTwo days later, both the City Defendants and the Defendant Judges filed motions in the Eighth Circuit to stay the injunction pending the appeal. On July 3, 2019, the Eighth Circuit granted the Defendants' motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending the outcome of the appeal.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court's order granting preliminary injunction on February 28, 2020. The court (Judges Ralph R. Erickson, Michael J. Melloy, and Jonathan A. Kobes) found, among other things, that in granting preliminary injunction, \"district court resorted to the “extraordinary remedy” of a preliminary injunction without giving adequate consideration to the new rules and their implementation.\" In so doing, \"it interjected the power of the federal government into the Missouri Supreme Court’s attempt to police its own lower courts, without contemplating what this would mean for federal-state relations.\" 950 F.3d 1052. In light of the opinion, the plaintiffs filed a motion for renewed preliminary injunction on April 13, 2020. \n\nOn May 22, 2020, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and a motion to decertify the class. The motions are pending as of August 18, 2020; the case is ongoing.

{"document": "This is a federal criminal case where the government attempted to introduce evidence obtained through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). On August 14, 2018, two operators of a Detroit gas station were indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for the crime of defrauding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The defendants allegedly bought SNAP funds from recipients with cash at a discounted price, then fraudulently billed the government for the total value. They were charged with 14 counts of wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343). The case was assigned to United States District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds. On September 12, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice notified the criminal defendants in this case that some of the evidence the government intended to use against them was obtained from a FISA warrant obtained under 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812. \n\nBoth men were released on bail after their arraignment on August 16, 2018. One defendant, represented by a federal public defender, pleaded guilty to a single count of wire fraud on December 6, 2018, prior to filing any pretrial motions. He was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison on April 18, 2019.\n\nThe other defendant, represented by private counsel, filed several pretrial motions relating to the FISA evidence. On February 8, 2019, he moved for discovery of the evidence obtained under FISA, as well as the application and order that allowed the government to collect it. \n\nThe government opposed this motion. On June 6, 2019, it filed a declaration from Attorney General William P. Barr claiming that an adversarial hearing would endanger national security and asking the court to conduct an <i>ex parte</i> and <i>in camera</i> review of the relevant documents. This process is set out in 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f) and 1825(g).\n\nLater on September 19, 2019, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment against him, claiming that the use of FISA material in this prosecution was improper because he was charged with a domestic criminal offense with no relationship to the normal subjects of FISA: foreign powers or their agents.\n\nJudge Edmunds denied both of the defendants' motions in a December 24, 2020 order. After reviewing the FISA warrant and application materials <i>ex parte</i> and <i>in camera</i> she found that they complied with the relevant statutory standards.

{"document": "On January 22, 2018, a mother and her minor son filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Department of State (DOS) for not granting U.S. citizenship to the child plaintiff because he was born outside of the U.S. to a same-sex dual-nationality couple. Represented by the nonprofit organization Immigration Equality and the private law firm Sullivan & Cromwell (who also represented plaintiffs in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16417\">a similar lawsuit</a> filed the same day), the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief granting birthright U.S. citizenship to the child. \n\nThe adult plaintiff, a natural-born U.S. citizen, entered into a civil partnership with her Italian partner in England in 2009. (The partnership was later converted into a marriage after the legalization of same-sex marriage in England in 2015.) While living in England, both women each gave birth to one son, with sperm from a donor. Both the children's birth certificates listed only the names of the two mothers as parents.\n\nHowever, when the mothers applied for U.S. citizenship for the two sons, DOS only recognized the citizenship of the son born to the U.S. citizen, under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 301(g) (8 U.S.C. § 1401(g)) (governing derivation of U.S. citizenship for a child born abroad to a U.S. citizen). DOS did not recognize U.S. citizenship of the child plaintiff born to the Italian woman because he lacked a biological or adoptive relationship to the U.S. citizen adult plaintiff. According to the plaintiffs, DOS erroneously considered this child born \"out of wedlock\" and not entitled to U.S. citizenship at birth under INA § 309 (8 U.S.C. § 1409). \n\nThe plaintiffs asserted that DOS had a policy of discrimination against the children of same-sex couples. Any child born to a U.S. citizen woman married to a man was born \"in wedlock.\" But a child of a U.S. citizen who was not the biological or adoptive parent, but instead whose spouse conceived through reproductive technology, could be considered born \"out of wedlock.\" The plaintiffs argued that this policy, which largely burdened same-sex couples, was unsupported by the INA's text and intent to keep families together, as well as case law supporting the rights of same-sex married couples.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that DOS's policy and its application to plaintiffs violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to the INA.\n\nThe case was assigned to Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell, and then reassigned to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan. \n\nStatus reports filed in May, July, and August 2018 indicated that the parties were continuing to try to resolve the matter without resorting to litigation. \n\nOn September 3, 2018, the DOS filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. With respect to the constitutional claims, the DOS argued that the plaintiffs failed to state an Equal Protection claim because a legal and biological relationship was required for a child to acquire citizenship from a parent, regardless of sex or sexual orientation of the parent. The DOS argued that the substantive due process right must also fail because the plaintiffs failed to state a fundamental right upon which the government has infringed. The DOS further argued that the Declaratory Judgment Act does not provide a cause of action, and that the plaintiffs APA claim must fail because there is an adequate remedy at law and the Department’s interpretation of “parent” as requiring both a legal and biological relationship was reasonable. \n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Court ordered both parties to submit supplemental briefs concerning the DOS’s motion to dismiss, in light of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California’s recent ruling in Dvash-Banks v. Pompeo, 2019 BL 63916 (C.D. Cal.), a summary of which can be <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16417\">found here</a>.\n\nOn March 19, 2019, the parties filed their supplemental memorandum. While the DOS found aspects of that ruling to be flawed, it encouraged the court in the present case to strongly consider the court’s ruling insofar as it dismissed those plaintiffs’ APA and Declaratory Judgment Act claims. The plaintiffs, for their part, distinguished the dismissal of the APA claim in Dvash-Banks from the present case, and argued that the central holding from the Dvash-Banks court supports their argument that the child plaintiff acquired citizenship at birth.\n\nIn late 2019, the plaintiffs relocated from London to New Jersey. The parties subsequently filed a joint motion to transfer the case from the District Court of D.C. to the District Court of New Jersey. The motion was granted, and the case was transferred on February 14, 2020. The case was assigned to Judge Kevin McNulty and Magistrate Judge James B. Clark. \n\nOn July 14, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which added as a cause of action 8 U.S.C. § 1503(a), a provision of the INA that authorizes courts to make de novo determinations and judgments of citizenship. Accordingly, the plaintiffs eliminated their APA claim and instead claimed that the Court can and should use its independent authority under the INA to declare the child plaintiff a U.S. citizen.\n\nA pretrial conference was held on September 14, 2020. Three days later, the Court ordered the parties to serve amended disclosures by September 28, 2020; to file a stipulation of agreed facts by September 28, 2020; to file motions for summary judgment by November 18, 2020; to file oppositions to such motions by January 4, 2021; and to file replies by February 4, 2021. \n\nThis case is ongoing.

{"document": "On November 7, 2017, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Arizona (LULAC-Arizona) and the Arizona Students’ Association (ASA) filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs sued the Secretary of State of Arizona (the Secretary) and the Maricopa County Recorder (the County Recorder) under the National Voter Registration Act and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Campaign Legal Center and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, sought a declaration that the policies of the Secretary violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs wanted the Secretary to (1) register voters to vote in federal elections regardless of whether they provide documentary proof of citizenship (DPOC); (2) match voters’ data with driving records to verify citizenship before rejecting voters for state and local elections; (3) refrain from requiring voters to re-submit DPOC when they moved counties, and subsequently to re-register; and (4) notify potential voters that they can register to vote in federal elections without DPOC. The plaintiffs claimed that there was undue burden on their right to vote and equal protection. Specifically, LULAC-Arizona and ASA alleged that Arizona treated voter registration applicants differently depending on whether they used Arizona’s state registration form (the “State Form”) or the national registration form (the “Federal Form”), and that Arizona’s arbitrary dual voter registration policies irrationally disenfranchised thousands of eligible Arizona voters and furthered no legitimate state interests. \n\nOn December 29, 2017, the Secretary responded to the plaintiffs’ claims and denied that Arizona’s voter registration policies violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments or were otherwise illegal under state or federal law. The Secretary asserted that Federal and State Form applicants were not similarly situated for equal protection purposes. The Secretary asserted that Arizona was constitutionally permitted to require those applying to register to vote using the State Form to personally provide DPOC at the time that they submitted their State Form. The Secretary further asserted that there was no constitutional or statutory requirement that Arizona election officials register applicants for federal elections when they had chosen to use the State Form to register to vote rather than the Federal Form. On January 29, 2018, the Court ordered a settlement conference to take place before Judge Eileen S. Willett. \n\nAccording to the later filed Consent Decree, after reviewing the applicable law, the Secretary and County Recorder concluded that current technology can treat State Form applications the same as Federal Form applications, which would make it easier for Arizona’s citizens to register to vote while also providing important safeguards to prevent unlawful voter registration. On 8 February 2018, the Secretary and County Recorder notified LULAC-Arizona and ASA that they wanted to get to an agreement that would resolve the underlying litigation and also benefit Arizona’s citizens.  \n\nOn June 4, 2018, the parties jointly filed a Consent Decree. They agreed that within thirty days after the entry of the Consent Decree, the Secretary was to revise the Procedures Manual to incorporate the terms of the Consent Decree, to provide guidance to the County Recorders to accept State Form applications submitted without DPOC, to enter all such applications in the Database, to immediately register the applicants for federal elections, and to check all State Form applications submitted without DPOC against the driving database. The Secretary was also to make reasonable efforts to better educate the citizens of Arizona concerning their opportunities to register to vote, and to update their website to explain that: (1) the State Form requires valid DPOC for state elections only; (2) submission of a sufficiently complete State Form with valid DPOC will make the applicant a Full Ballot Voter; (3) submission of a sufficiently complete State Form without DPOC will make the applicant a Federal Only Voter; (4) the Federal Form does not require DPOC; (5) submission of the Federal Form without valid DPOC will make the applicant a Federal Only Voter; and (6) submission of the Federal Form with valid DPOC will make the applicant a Full Ballot Voter. \n\nOn June 18 2018, Judge David G. Campbell approved the consent decree and retained jurisdiction over the case until December 31, 2020 to ensure the decree’s terms were followed. \n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion to compel compliance with consent decree on November 9, 2018 and a second motion to compel compliance on November 12, 2018. Both motions requested expedited rulings. Two days later, on November 14, the court denied the motions. As of April 21, 2020, there has been no substantial action in the docket since then.

If not dismissed, the defendant requested language regarding the understaffing allegations be stricken as the understaffing did not suggest discrimination under ADA.

{"document": "On March 25, 2009, the United States Department of Justice filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of African-American applicants to entry-level firefighter positions.  The plaintiff alleged that, from 2004-2008, the City of Portsmouth fire department's practice of requiring applicants to pass an examination in order to be considered for an entry-level firefighter positions had a disparate impact on the hiring of African-Americans, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  They sought injunctive relief to stop the defendant's discriminatory hiring practices, and damages for those who have been impacted by them.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiff alleged that, since 2004, the city has administered a standardized test that applicants must pass with a minimum score of 70%, in order to be considered for hire into entry-level firefighter positions.  The results of the test are then combined with scores from a personal interview to rank candidates for selection.  The test passage rate of white test-takers was twice that of African Americans.  The test is not essential to the job of firefighting and it prematurely eliminated 86 African Americans from the application process.\n\nOn July 23, 2009, following a hearing on the matter, the District Court (Judge Mark S. Davis) ruled that a joint settlement agreement was fair and that the court would enforce it.  The agreement held that the city could not use any selection method for entry-level firefighting positions that had a disparate impact on African Americans or was not job related (preferably both).  It could, however, use the 2008 test to fill essential vacancies as long as they did not do so in a way that maintained the discriminatory impact.  After these essential hires the city must use a new selection method.  Both of these conditions were subject to either US or court approval.\n\nAccording to the settlement agreement, the city must also pay out a total of $145,000 to African-American applicants who failed the test between 2004 and 2008, but who did well on the reading comprehension part of the test.  The city had to notify these former applicants and they, in turn, had to make a claim for an award out of the $145,000.  Following a second fairness hearing, on April 29, 2010, the District Court (Judge Davis) set the final list of people eligible for this relief.\n\nThe city also had to make ten priority hires of African Americans who were discriminatorily eliminated from the application process, based on the list of people eligible for monetary relief.

{"document": "On April 13, 2010, rejected U.S. Census Bureau job applicants filed an employment discrimination class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, represented by a coalition of public interest attorney organizations and private counsel, alleged that Census hiring procedures, which pre-screened all applicants with arrest records, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. \n\nThe Census screened out applicants whose names turn up in an FBI database, indicating an arrest record regardless of whether the arrest led to a criminal conviction or to any action at all. Applicants were required to provide the Census with official documents from any criminal case that shows up on their record within 30 days of their application. The plaintiffs claimed the 30-day letter requirement was unduly burdensome - if not impossible - to comply with since the documentation requested may have been sealed, expunged, lost, or destroyed due to age. \n\nBecause African Americans and Latinos were more likely to have arrest records than whites, the plaintiffs claimed the hiring policies discriminated against people of color in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. This was supported by a letter the EEOC sent the Census in 2009 criticizing the policy, warning that it may be in violation of Title VII. The plaintiffs also claimed that the compliance procedures did not distinguish among applicants with recent, serious convictions and those with records of long-ago, minor - often non-criminal - conduct, and that the requirement therefore had no job-related relevance.\n\nThe plaintiffs requested injunctive relief to alter the Census hiring practices, eliminating the 30-day letter requirement and other modifications to comply with the Uniform Guidelines for Employee Selection Procedures and related EEOC Guidance.

{"document": "On February 10, 2011, the United States Department of Justice (Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section) released a letter of findings detailing the results of its investigation into the institutionalization of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Virginia.  The investigation focused specifically on the Central Virginia Training Center (CVTC), an intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities (ICF/DD), but also considered the statewide institutionalization of this population (DOJ's involvement began as an investigation of CVTC pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act but later expanded to include the statewide system's compliance with the ADA).  The DOJ concluded that Virginia was systematically violating the Americans with Disabilities Act under the 1999 Supreme Court precedent, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11643\">Olmstead v. LC</a>, in forcing the unnecessary institutionalization of people with disabilities.  The DOJ found a lack of sufficient community-based services available to this population, an unreasonably long waiting list for Medicaid waiver services, inadequate discharge planning at CVTC, and other deficiencies.  According to the DOJ, these policies lead to a situation in which individuals with developmental disabilities were housed unnecessarily in institutions and were unable to either remain in the community or transition from an institution to a community placement. \n\nNearly one year later, the DOJ and Virginia entered into a settlement agreement to remedy the deficiencies outlined in the findings letter.  The DOJ filed a complaint and settlement agreement in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on January 26, 2012.  The court (Judge John A. Gibney, Jr.) gave preliminary approval to the agreement and allowed interested parties to submit letters and amici curiae briefs to the court in advance of the final approval of the settlement.  On March 2, 2012, several individuals then living in institutions filed a motion to intervene in the litigation, claiming that they wished to remain in institutions and that the proposed settlement would force the closing of their institutions. The court found that they had adequately demonstrated that they stood to be affected by the outcome of the litigation and granted their intervention in the case on May 9, 2012. 282 F.R.D. 403. The intervenors then filed a motion to dismiss, challenging the United States' authority to bring the claim to enforce the ADA.\n\nOn June 5, 2012, the court denied the intervenors' motion to dismiss, finding that DOJ's ADA enforcement authority included the ability to investigate and file suit in federal court as had occurred here, and that the government had followed all necessary procedures.  \n\nOn August 23, 2012, the court finalized its approval of the settlement between the United States and Virginia.  Under the settlement, Virginia agreed to increase its community-based services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  The goal of the agreement was to prevent individuals living in their communities from being forced into institutions, and to allow those living in institutions to transition to their communities. Virginia agreed to create additional slots on its Home and Community Based Services Medicaid waiver programs and to allow those on the waitlist to begin receiving services.  The state also agreed to provide crisis services and employment training. \n\nReports from the independent reviewer over the next three years noted significant progress in certain areas, including the discharge of adults from institutions and development of adult crisis services. However, in other areas, progress lagged. On September 23, 2015, the DOJ submitted a motion for a court-ordered schedule of implementation. Shortly afterward, the Intervenors filed a statement of interest asking that the court suspend the closure of remaining institutions until the State could show that adequate financial and community support structures were in place. \n\nBefore the court made a determination on the DOJ's schedule motion, the parties negotiated and agreed on specific implementation schedules. The DOJ subsequently withdrew its motion in January 2016.\n\nOn August 4, 2017, the Intervenors filed a motion for injunctive relief. The Intervenors alleged that several former residents who had never voluntarily consented to a move from the State Training Centers were coerced by the State into transitioning into the community. They asked that the court permanently enjoin the State from forcibly removing residents from Training Centers and that it issue a declaratory judgment stating that the State had acted in violation of state laws. \n\nA hearing on the motion took place on November 6, 2017. On February 2, 2018, the court (Judge Gibney) denied the Intervenors' motion. The court found that though the Intervenors had standing to pursue their motion for injunctive relief, the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the motion because the Intervenors' claims did not form part of the same case or controversy as the DOJ's ADA claims and, further, because Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity prevents federal courts from enjoining states based on state law claims. Even if it had jurisdiction, the court found that the Intervenors did not meet the standard for an award of injunctive relief.\n\nThe court began the process of terminating the case in 2019.

Some of the named plaintiffs had not been afforded a bond hearing yet; others had been denied bond.\n\nThis case was filed on June 13, 2019, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts as a habeas corpus petition and putative class action complaint against the Department of Justice, which is responsible for operating the immigration courts. Plaintiffs sought to represent a class of detainees detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), “either within Massachusetts or otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Boston Immigration Court.”\n\nThe case was assigned to Chief Judge Patti Saris. Plaintiffs’ lawyers included a private firm, the ACLU National Prison Project, and two state ACLU affiliates (New Hampshire and Massachusetts).\n\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  They argued that the burden of proof in immigration bond properly lays not on the detainee but on the government.  Second, they sought implementation of a “clear and convincing evidence” standard; that is, they argued that bond should be granted unless there was clear and convincing evidence of a safety or flight risk need for ongoing detention. Third, they claimed that alternative conditions of release must be considered by immigration courts.  Finally, they claimed that immigration courts must consider detainees’ ability to pay when they set bond.\n\nOn August 6, 2019, the court certified two classes, each for detainees held under §1226(a)--one for those who had not yet received a bond hearing and the other for those who had received a hearing but had been denied bond. 395 F.Supp.3d 135.\n\nOn November 27, 2019, Judge Saris ruled on the request for an injunction, granting it in part and denying it in part. First, the Court agreed with the plaintiffs that the burden of proof should be placed on the government to prove that the detainee was dangerous or a flight risk. Second, it held that immigration courts must evaluate detainees' ability to pay. Third, immigration courts must consider alternative conditions of release including GPS monitoring. However, the Court rejected the plaintiffs’ \"clear and convincing evidence\" proposal, instead of holding that the “preponderance of evidence” standard would apply. The Court rejected plaintiffs’ request for re-dos on all the bond hearings members of the post-hearing class that had lost but ordered the government to report various facts to class counsel including whether a new bond hearing was held under the injunction’s rules. 415 F.Supp.3d 258.\n\nBoth sides appealed.  Plaintiffs sought review of the District Court’s “preponderance of evidence” ruling.  The government challenged the rest of the decision.  This case is ongoing.\n", "summary": "In this class action covering the Boston Immigration Court (which covers immigration detainees in Massachusetts and other parts of New England), the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ordered numerous procedural changes to immigration court bond hearings. First, the Court put the burden on the government, not the detainee, to prove a flight risk or danger to the public. Second, immigration courts must consider the detainee's ability to pay. Finally, immigration courts must consider alternative conditions of release. Appeal is pending."}
{"document": "On December 4, 2014, eight female inmates of Muskegon County Jail (MCJ) filed this  lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Muskegon County, Michigan.  The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Michigan and private counsel, sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages, claiming that the conditions of confinement at the MCJ were inhumane and unconstitutional. The plaintiffs brought the case as a class action; it was assigned to Judge Janet T. Neff.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that, in addition to being exposed to unsafe physical conditions, male guards at the prison are permitted to watch female inmates while they change clothes, shower, and use the bathroom. The plaintiff also alleged they were referred to by slurs and often denied clean underwear and basic sanitary items such as toilet paper and feminine hygiene products.  These conditions, the plaintiffs contended, violated the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment, the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, and the prohibition against punishment of pretrial detainees under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n\nOn the same day the complaint was filed, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and to certify the class. The plaintiffs sought an order requiring the defendants to take immediate measures to repair broken and backed-up plumbing and other failures of basic infrastructure, treat and exterminate infestations of mold and vermin, and implement a regular system of inspection, maintenance and repair to prevent these and related conditions. The plaintiffs also sought for the defendants to provide female prisoners with privacy from being routinely viewed by male prison staff, to provide women with reasonable access to toilet paper, feminine hygiene products, clean undergarments, etc., and to provide these prisoners with out-of-cell exercise opportunities for at least one hour per day. \n\nThe motion for class certification consisted of four classes: (1) all current and future inmates at the Muskegon County Jail (“MCJ”), represented by plaintiff Stashia Collins, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from unconstitutional conditions of confinement that affect all inmates (Overcrowding Injunctive Class); (2) all current and future female inmates at MCJ, represented by Ms. Collins, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from unconstitutional conditions of confinement specific to female inmates (Female Injunctive Class); (3) all inmates incarcerated at MCJ within three years prior to the filing of the complaint in this case, represented by the plaintiffs, seeking damages for harm suffered as a result of unconstitutional conditions of confinement that affect all inmates (Overcrowding Damages Class); and (4) all female inmates incarcerated at MCJ within three years prior to the filing of the complaint in this case, represented by the plaintiffs, seeking damages for harm suffered as a result of unconstitutional conditions of confinement specific to female inmates (Female Damages Class).\n\nOn February 6, 2015, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding three additional named plaintiffs. On July 1, 2015, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the amended complaint, arguing that it failed to state any plausible Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment conditions of confinement claims.\n\nOn September 11, 2015, Judge Neff granted in part and denied in part the defendant’s motion. 2015 WL 9906265. The court dismissed Count III (Denial of Access to Feminine Hygiene Products, Toilet Paper and Adequate Underwear and Other Clothing) and Count IV (Severe Overcrowding and Other Abysmal Conditions) but retained Count I (Violation of Privacy and Bodily Integrity) and Count II (Denial of Exercise). In the same order, Judge Neff denied without prejudice the plaintiffs’ pending motions for class certification, a preliminary injunction, and expert testimony in support of a preliminary injunction but left the plaintiffs opportunity to re-file to conform to the court’s standards. \n\nThe plaintiffs appealed this order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit insofar as the district court’s order denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to Count III, and denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On May 12, 2016, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal as it pertained to the motion for summary judgment and the motion for class certification but the appeal was allowed to proceed as it related to the denial of preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of this decision but the motion was denied on December 12, 2016.\n\nOn March 31, 2016, the plaintiffs moved for joinder of four new plaintiffs and partial renewal of class certification. Specifically, the plaintiffs requested certification of a class of all current and future female inmates at the Muskegon County Jail (MCJ) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. On February 7, 2017, the court entered an order holding these motions in abeyance.\n\nOn October 19, 2016, the parties agreed to dismiss Count V of the complaint and filed an order of dismissal. The court granted this motion that same day. The following year, the parties were able to come to a settlement agreement. On May 31, 2017, the parties had a settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Ellen S. Carmody, where the parties reviewed their settlement. The agreement, consisted of monetary and injunctive relief. Each plaintiff was to be paid damages in the amount of $20,000 and the defendants were required to change policies regarding dispersal of medication, hygiene products, exercise, and cross-gender viewing. The agreement dictated that, pending final approval by the court, this case would be dismissed with prejudice and the appeal and the motion for class certification would be withdrawn.\n\nHaving settled, the parties filed a proposed stipulation and order of dismissal with prejudice which the court granted on July 24, 2017. The district court did not retain jurisdiction to enforce the agreement due to it being a private settlement agreement. That same day, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal.

These allegations surfaced after the Federal Reserve completed a routine compliance check with two of Fleet Mortgage Financial Group's branches in Westbury, New York and Woodbridge, New Jersey.  \n\nThe parties settled the case on June 24, 1996, which was approved by the court.  Under the settlement agreement, the defendant was required to establish a four million dollar settlement fund to compensate minority borrowers who the parties agreed had paid higher prices for loans between August 1993 and June 1994.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Uptown People's Law Center, alleged that prison employees confiscated several items of personal property from their cells.

{"document": "On February 7, 2013, four immigrants born in Mexico with prior arrests for alleged violations of an Alabama state law prohibiting fishing without a license filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The plaintiffs sued the Alabama Department of Homeland Security (\"ADHS\") and Alabama's Administrative Office of the Court (\"AOC\") under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, SPLC, NILC, and private counsel, challenged enforcement of HB 658 § 5, which required the AOC to compile the names and identifying information of undocumented immigrants who had been detained for any violation of state law and ADHS to post that information for the public on its website. They sought a declaratory judgment that the enforcement of HB 658 § 5 violated the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution and the Due Process Clause of Amendment XIV of the U.S. Constitution and to enjoin the defendants from enforcing HB 658 § 5. \n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs claimed that Section 5 of H.B. 658 Act No. 2012-491, which is codified as Ala. Code § 31-13-32, was preempted by federal law in violation of the Supremacy Clause, and also violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 5 of HB 658 required the AOC to compile, and the ADHS post on its public website, the names and other identifying information of \"unlawfully present alien[s]\" who were detained for any violation of state law and who then appeared in a state court. The four plaintiffs feared that their prior arrests and scheduled appearance in court for fishing without a license would enable the defendants to publicize their names on this list that would result in various consequences such as the denial of bail, denial of employment opportunities, and a significant loss of privacy.\n\nThe proposed class certification was: \"All persons who are or will be subject to Section 5 of HB 658, Ala. Code § 31-13-32\".\n\nOn February 8, 2013, the case was reassigned from District Court Judge W. Harold Albritton, III to U.S. District Judge William Keith Watkins. The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Charles S. Coody.\n\nOn July 31, 2013, the defendants' motion to dismiss was granted by Judge Watkins. The court identified the following impediments to the plaintiffs’ standing: (1) the plaintiffs failed to allege that they were \"unlawfully present aliens\" subject to the consequences prescribed by Ala. Code § 31-13-32, the state law which they challenged as unconstitutional; and (2) the plaintiffs failed to allege that they were \"unlawfully present aliens\" at the crucial times identified by the law – i.e., when they were detained by law enforcement and when they appeared in court for a violation of state law. Without asserting they were unlawfully present aliens, the plaintiffs could not show that they faced the threat of imminent injury. The court afforded the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to cure these impediments to standing. The plaintiffs did not amend their complaint, but filed a motion requesting that the court reconsider and vacate its July 31, 2013 opinion and order. \n\nOn January 6, 2014, the motion for reconsideration was granted and the order of July 31, 2013 was vacated as the plaintiffs should not have been required to plead that they were in fact \"unlawfully present aliens.\"\n\nOn May 4, 2014, Judge Watkins granted the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing because the plaintiffs failed to allege that they were unlawfully present aliens. The plaintiffs requested reconsideration of that ruling. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider, reinstated the previously pending motions, and directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing. \n\nOn May 20, 2014, Judge Watkins granted the plaintiffs' request to withhold their identities from the public but not from the defendants. \n\nOn July 3, 2014, Judge Watkins denied the class certification without prejudice with leave to refile on or before September 5, 2014. \n\nThe parties began mediation proceedings on September 11, 2014, and they eventually reached a private settlement agreement. Under the settlement, the AOC agreed not to forward information it collected under § 31-13-32 to other government agencies except the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency; in turn, the Agency promised not to publish the § 31-13-32 information it received from the AOC. On October 10, 2014, the judge dismissed the case but retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement's terms. \n\nThe agreement was to be in effect for 5 years (from October 2014 until October 2019), and there has been no further activity on the docket since October 2014.

{"document": "On November 23, 2015, five Texas Planned Parenthoods (provider plaintiffs) and ten Medicaid patients of Planned Parenthood (patient plaintiffs) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued the Executive Commissioner and the Inspector General of the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, asked the court for class action certification; declaratory judgments; temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions; and attorney's fees. The plaintiffs claimed that HHSC had violated the Medicaid Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by barring the provider plaintiffs from the Medicaid program.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs explained that on October 21, 2015, the HHSC notified the provider plaintiffs that HHSC would soon terminate the Provider Plaintiffs' Medicaid Provider Agreement. The HHSC justified the termination using false allegations, which were primarily based on misleading videos leaked by anti-choice activists. \n\nThe HHSC claimed that the case was premature because they had not yet terminated the provider plaintiffs' Medicaid Provider Agreement. On January 27, 2016, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks stayed the case pending a final termination letter. For nearly a year, the case lay relatively dormant. In this time, Texas and the U.S. Congress conducted separate investigations into the allegations against Planned Parenthood raised by the misleading videos. Planned Parenthood was repeatedly found free of wrongdoing. Nonetheless, on December 20, 2016, HHSC sent a final Notice of Termination to each provider plaintiff. \n\nOn January 17, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint outlining the events since the order to stay the case. That day the court held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent termination. On January 19, 2017, Judge Sparks entered an order temporarily enjoining the defendants from terminating the provider plaintiffs' Medicaid Provider Agreements until February 21, 2017. \n\nOn February 21, 2017, Judge Sparks granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the defendants from terminating the Provider Plaintiffs' Medicaid Provider Agreements.

The panel determined that while the individual plaintiffs had a private right of action, the district court erred by failing to defer to agency's findings, by accepting evidence beyond agency record and by conducting de novo review. Judge Jones wrote a concurrence urging a rehearing en banc to reconsider whether the individual plaintiffs did have a private right of action on behalf of Medicaid patients to challenge the termination of their providers’ contracts. \n\nThe defendants filed a petition for rehearing en banc on January 31, 2019. The next day, the defendants filed a petition to stay the district court’s preliminary injunction pending the rehearing, which was granted on February 4, 2019. 914 F.3d 994. \n\nOn February 4, 2019, the en banc court granted rehearing on the court’s own motion, therefore appellants’ petition for rehearing en banc filed on January 31, 2019, was denied as moot. 914 F.3d 994.\n\nThe same day, the plaintiffs submitted an opposition to the defendants' stay application.

{"document": "On Feb. 22, 2018, eight Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients from El Salvador and Haiti, as well as the Massachusetts immigrants' rights organization Centro Presente, filed this lawsuit. Represented by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, the plaintiffs challenged the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)'s recent revocation of TPS for Salvadorians and Haitians living in the United States. The plaintiffs alleged that DHS violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking mandamus (for DHS to carry out the INA's procedures for reviewing TPS), injunctive relief, and a declaratory judgment.\n\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Secretary of Homeland Security may find that a country's conditions temporarily prevent its nationals from returning safely, or that the country is unable to adequately handle the return of nationals. In such a situation, the Secretary may grant TPS to these nationals for six to eighteen months, with a possible extension following a review of country conditions. TPS allows recipients to remain and work legally in the United States.\n\nDHS had initiated TPS for Salvadorians and for Haitians following devastating earthquakes in those countries in 2001 and 2010 respectively. After each 18-month period since then, DHS had reviewed the program, determined that the nationals could not yet return safely to their countries (due to severe safety, health, housing, and infrastructure problems, exacerbated by subsequent natural disasters), and extended the program.\n\nThis policy, however, ended with DHS's announcement that it would soon terminate TPS for Haitians (effective July 2019) and for Salvadorians (effective Sept. 2019). The plaintiffs argued that DHS's decision to end the program was based not on a change in conditions in El Salvador or Haiti, but rather on invidious discrimination toward black and Latino immigrants on the basis of race, ethnicity, and/or national origin. This racial animus allegedly appeared in President Trump's public remarks disparaging Haitians and Latin American immigrants. This case was assigned to Judge Denise J. Casper. \n\nOn May 9, 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding additional claims that the government violated the APA. The government moved to dismissed the complaint, the court (Judge Casper) granted it in part and denied in part on July 23, 2018. 332 F.Supp.3d 393. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' mandamus claim because they had not yet exhausted all other avenues of relief. Otherwise, the court denied the motion to dismiss, holding that it had subject matter jurisdiction and that President Trump did not have to be dismissed as a defendant at this stage. The court also held that the government had not proven elements to show its changed policy will survive review under the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard, including displaying awareness of its changed position, demonstrating good reasons for the new policy, and displaying awareness of the reliance upon the longstanding prior policy. The court also held that the plaintiffs' constitutional claims should not be dismissed, finding \"that the combination of a disparate impact on particular racial groups, statements of animus by people plausibly alleged to be involved in the decision-making process, and an allegedly unreasoned shift in policy\" were sufficient to suggest the policy shift was motivated by discriminatory purposes. \n\nWith the government shutdown, the defendants filed a motion to stay all proceedings. The plaintiffs took no position on the request for a limited stay, noting that the  <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16815 \">Ramos v.

{"document": "On December 21, 2016, after a two-year investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division released its findings that Louisiana unnecessarily relied on nursing facilities to service people with mental disabilities in violation of the community integration mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as well as the Supreme Court ruling in Olmstead v. L.C. \n\nThe investigation focused on Louisiana residents with serious mental disabilities who received care and services in nursing facilities. The DOJ found that individuals who needed to obtain health services from the state for serious mental disabilities were forced to live in nursing facilities to receive proper care. This system isolated these individuals from their communities when they could live in an integrated setting if given access to adequate evidence-based community services. \n\nThe DOJ found that around 4,000 residents with serious mental disabilities were housed in nursing facilities in Louisiana each year. These residents were generally younger, had less nursing needs and lived in the facilities longer than a typical nursing home resident. Further, the report alleged that Louisiana could likely serve these individuals more effectively and for less money in their communities. \n\nThe findings letter emphasized four key conclusions: <li>That individuals with serious mental disabilities are confined to nursing home care in Louisiana because the state does not adequately arrange community-based services or properly identify those who would benefit from such services.</li><li>That individuals who would benefit from community-based services don’t know these services are available because the state has not told them.</li><li>That many of the individuals receiving service in nursing facilities can successfully live in the community rather than institutions.</li><li>And that other states successfully provide these services without unnecessarily relying on nursing facilities and the Louisiana already provides many of the necessary services and could serve more people by expanding pre-existing programs. </li> \nThe DOJ and Louisiana reached a settlement to address the findings in the DOJ's report Louisiana agreed to review and augment its current policies for the seriously mentally ill. The DOJ then filed this lawsuit alleging that Louisiana failed to serve people with serious mental illnesses in the most integrated situation appropriate to their needs in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana on June 6, 2018, and immediately moved to dismiss due to the settlement. \n\nSpecifically, the settlement agreement focused on diversion and screening for the target population of Medicaid-eligible individuals over the age of 18 with serious mental disabilities who either reside in nursing facilities or who have been referred for review for placement in nursing facilities. The state agreed to design and implement a system designed to quickly identify individuals under review for nursing home care who would benefit from community-based services and divert them away from institutionalization. The state also agreed to screen all individuals in the target population currently in nursing home care to determine whether they should be allowed to return to the community. The screening process starts with the assumption that all individuals with serious mental disabilities in nursing homes would benefit more from community-based services. \n\nThe agreement also called for specific elements of the plan such as outreach to affected individuals, transition support committees, post-discharge case management and tracking. It also required the expansion of community-based service programs. These included mandatory crisis support services including a 24/7 emergency hotline, intensive community support services such as psychiatric treatment and housing and tenancy support. \n\nIn addition, the agreement stipulated that the state had to implement a quality assurance program to make sure individuals in the target population received proper care. The state also agreed to retain a subject matter expert, John O’Brien, who will provide technical expertise to help the state fully comply with the agreement and produce a report every six months on the quality and progress of the plan.\n\nThe agreement called for an initial plan to be submitted by the Louisiana Department of Health immediately that laid out the goals and details of the first 18 months. After 18 months, the LDH must produce a yearly report detailing goals for the coming year. \n\nThe agreement was set to expire in five years provided the parties agree that the state has established compliance with the agreement and maintained compliance for one year. Under the settlement, the court retained jurisdiction and  DOJ could reinstate the suit at any time to remedy a breach of the settlement as long as it first followed the dispute resolution laid out in the agreement. The case is ongoing for compliance with the settlement agreement.

Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that the Florida Department of Corrections violated RLIUPA and substantially burdened the prisoners' religious exercise by not offering kosher meals to inmates.\n\nOn May 15, 2013, Muslim prisoners filed a motion to intervene, seeking halal, or in the alternative, kosher meals for Muslim prisoners who observed halal dietary laws. Judge Patricia A. Seitz denied the motion on September 6, 2013. 2013 WL 4786829.\n\nThe court issued a preliminary injunction on December 6, 2013. It required the defendants to provide a kosher diet program to all prisoners with a sincere religious belief by July 2014. It also enjoined three of the state’s methods for issuing a religious diet program: 1) the Orthodox sincerity test, 2) the “ten-percent rule,” which removed a prisoner from the Religious Diet Program for missing ten percent of meals within a month, and 3) a zero tolerance rule that suspended the kosher diet for prisoners who were caught eating non-kosher once, without opportunity to contest suspension.\n\nThe defendants filed motions for a stay of the preliminary injunction both to the Eleventh Circuit and the district court. The motions contested the enjoining of the three “tests” for granting a kosher diet as well as the July 2014 deadline for compliance. The Eleventh Circuit denied the motion for a stay in May 2014. The district then denied the motion for stay in June 2014. On June 27, 2014, the Circuit remanded to the district court to alter the July deadline.\n\nOn February 27, 2015, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the defendant's remaining appeals of the preliminary injunction because of mootness. It ruled that under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), which governs all RLUIPA challenges, a preliminary injunction would expire automatically after 90 days unless the court “makes the findings required under subsection (a)(1) for the entry of prospective relief. . .” and “makes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2). The district court made neither finding, so the preliminary injunction expired in March 2014.\n\nJudge Seitz ruled on the summary judgment motions for declaratory relief and permanent injunctions on April 30, 2015. 2015 WL 1977795. Declaratory relief was granted to the plaintiffs for three claims. The court held that the defendant violated RLUIPA through 1) denial of a kosher diet to sincere prisoners, 2) its “ten-percent rule”, and 3) its zero tolerance rule. \n\nSummary judgment was also granted to the defendants on two claims, declaring that 1) the doctrinal sincerity test for a special diet did not violate RLUIPA as long as it was not unduly weighted in determining sincerity, and 2) an anti-bartering policy did not violate RLUIPA.\n\nThe court then issued its final ruling on a permanent injunction on August 12, 2015. 2015 WL 4768247. The injunction ordered the defendants to 1) offer a kosher diet to all prisoners with a sincere religious basis for keeping kosher, 2) end the ten percent rule, and 3) stop enforcement of the zero tolerance rule without an opportunity for prisoners to contest their removal or suspension. The court then furthered ordered that the defendants create auditing and training procedures, produce both monthly and quarterly reports, and open access of their facilities to the Federal Dept. of Corrections. It provided a thirty day period to cure the failures in the kosher diet program.\n\nOn September 11, 2015, the defendants appealed the order. On July 14, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit (Judges William Pryor, Jill Pryor, Richard Story) denied the appeal, holding that the defendants had not proved a compelling governmental interest for not providing kosher meals to the inmates. Moreover, the court stated that even if the defendants had a compelling governmental interest, there was no proof that denying kosher meals was the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.\n\nOver the following months, the court continued to receive reports on compliance with the order and also fielded grievances from prisoners denied entry into the kosher diet program (though none received an additional hearing). A hearing was held on October 23, 2018, when the parties discussed the quarterly and monthly reports, the auditing process and filing a joint motion to terminate the injunction. The the joint motion to terminate the injunction and declaratory judgement was filed on December 5, 2018.  \n\nOn January 9, 2019, the court ordered the motion to terminate the injunction to be granted following two years without evidence of violation. However, the court denied the motion to terminate the declaratory judgement to ensure the Department of Corrections continues to have a legal responsibility to meet religious dietary preferences. \n\nDuring April and May, prisoners mailed motions requesting enforced relief and inquiring into updates in the proceedings. On May 22, 2019, the court denied the motion to enforce relief from the previously entered permanent injunction. However, the permanent injunction was dissolved on January 9, 2019, and there was no injunction to enforce. \n\nAs of October 31, 2019, the declaratory judgement remains in effect ensuring the Department of Corrections to meet the religious dietary preferences of prisoners.", "summary": "The U.S Department of Justice, on behalf of Jewish prisoners in Southern Florida's Correctional Facilities, filed suit against the Florida Department of Corrections for failing to offer kosher meal options.

The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and private counsel, alleged that the defendant operated a deprivation scheme intended to force detained immigrants to work nearly for free for the detention facility, resulting in a forced labor scheme and an economic windfall for the defendant. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant deprived detainees of basic necessities so that they were forced to work to purchase those items and threatened those who refused to work with serious harm, such as deprivation of privacy, criminal prosecution, or solitary confinement. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages.

{"document": "Thousands of United States Sailors and Marines are deployed to combat zones across the globe, and return home suffering from the invisible wounds of war, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sometimes these mental health issues indirectly lead to less-than-Honorable discharges, resulting in permanent stigma and preventing veterans from accessing essential benefits like the GI bill and much-needed mental health care. The Naval Discharge Review Board adjudicates discharge upgrade applications from veterans seeking an appeal of their less-than-Honorable discharge. In 2014, then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed these boards to consider PTSD and related conditions as “potential mitigating factors in the misconduct that caused the under-other-than-honorable-conditions characterization of service.” This Hagel Memo was codified by Congress in 2016, statutorily requiring Discharge Review Boards to grant “liberal consideration” to the discharge upgrade applications of veterans with symptoms related to PTSD or TBI. 10 U.S.C. §1553(d)(3)(A)(ii). \n\nOn March 2, 2018, Tyson Manker and the National Veterans Council for Legal Redress (NVCLR), represented by the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School and private counsel, filed a class-action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut on behalf of a class of Navy and Marine Corps veterans. The complaint was filed against the Secretary of the Navy. According to the plaintiffs, the Naval Discharge Review Board rejected almost 90% of discharge upgrade applications based on credible claims of service-connected PTSD, without clearly explaining what a veteran must show to prevail, and without applying the proper legal standards. The plaintiffs alleged that the Board violated the Administrative Procedure Act by issuing arbitrary and capricious decisions that were inconsistent with relevant statutory law, and deprived applicants of their Fifth Amendment rights to due process of law. They argued that the Board’s actions, in violation of binding Department of Defense guidance, evidenced an unconstitutional secret policy against granting discharge upgrades: the Board had set an unachievable and sometimes unknown evidentiary burden for applicants alleging PTSD as a basis for a discharge upgrade. \n\nThe plaintiffs requested that the Court set aside and hold unlawful the Board’s improper denials of veterans’ discharge upgrade applications, order the applications' approval, and issue injunctive relief to ensure that all Navy and Marine Corps veterans had their discharge upgrade applications considered according to the Constitution and as intended by Congress. The case was assigned to Judge Charles S.

The plaintiff, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, asked the court for injunctive  and declaratory relief, claiming that their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated, as well as violations of federal regulations and the state constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the maintenance of \"Spy Files\" on leftist groups in Colorado for lawful, peaceful, non-criminal activities and falsely labeling the groups \"criminal extremist\" was a violation of the constitutional rights of its members to petition the government for redress of grievances, the freedom of association, and a misappropriation of federal funds in electronically storing this information. \n\nOn March 11, 2002, the ACLU published the partial contents of leaked \"Spy Files\" that the Denver police had been maintaining on several organizations and individuals. The ACLU petitioned the Mayor of Denver to investigate take four specific actions to stem the dissemination and expunge the Spy Files.  The Mayor held a news conference in which he claimed that the Spy Files resulted from an overly broad interpretation of the City's policy on the maintenance of criminal intelligence.\n\nThe city's policy mirrored a federal regulation (28 C.F.R § 23.20) that prohibited the police from maintaining criminal intelligence electronic records that would violate citizens' constitutional rights, absent (1) a direct relationship to criminal conduct, and (2) a reasonable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal activity.  \n\nThe disclosed records detailed the protest activities of individuals not only in Colorado, but lists of protest and political beliefs of persons from outside the state. The Spy Files also labeled several organizations as criminal extremists (notably including the American Friends Service Committee, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1947).  The plaintiffs alleged that this information was false, that the organizations were not criminally extremist, and that there were statements of the political beliefs of the members that the City had misconstrued were defamatory.

The city also agreed to furnish copies to all individuals and organizations on which the city maintained criminal intelligence files.

Represented by Florida's Advocacy Center for Persons with Disabilities, the plaintiffs asked the U.S District Court for the Southern District of Florida for declaratory and injunctive relief.   \n\nIn May 1998, defendants filed a motion to dismiss based, among other things, on lack of standing and failure to state a claim under the ADA.  Defendants also argued that plaintiffs were barred from bringing suit against the State because the State was immune from suit by private citizens under the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In July 1998, the United States Department of Justice filed a motion to intervene in the case and included a memorandum in opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss. The DOJ also filed for leave to address as amicus curiae the proper construction of the ADA as it related to this case. \n\nIn its memo on the motion to dismiss, the DOJ argued that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act were valid examples of Congress's power to abrogate, or abolish, the states' immunity from suit by private citizens. It also argued that both the ADA and the integration mandate established by the Supreme Court in L.C. v. Olmstead in 1998 provided a cause of action under which plaintiffs could challenge unnecessary institutionalization of mentally ill persons.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This lawsuit was filed by four medical providers and an individual seeking medical services to challenge the state’s executive orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. On May 28, the court filed a notice of hearing regarding certification of issues to the Michigan Supreme Court. On June 16 the court stayed the case until the Michigan Supreme Court resolved the state law questions. On June 25, the defendants appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit. The Michigan Supreme Court held that the Governor's executive orders exceeded her authority on October 2, 2020. The case is ongoing. <hr>\n\nOn May 12, 2020, four medical providers and an individual seeking medical services filed a suit against Michigan’s Attorney General, Governor, and Director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to challenge the state’s executive orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C § 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that executive orders 2020-17 and 2020-77 violated the Michigan Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment and Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, or, alternatively, that the plaintiffs were permitted to continue their business operations. They also sought injunctive relief preventing the defendants from enforcing the orders against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs also sought attorneys' fees and monetary damages, and they were represented by the Mackinac Center Legal Foundation and private attorneys. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, and assigned to District Judge Paul L. Maloney. \n\nOn March 11, The Governor of Michigan proclaimed a state of emergency under both the Emergency Management Act and the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act of 1945 (the Emergency Powers Act). Under the initial announcement, the Governor issued various stay at home orders and restrictions, including order 2020-17, which prohibited any bariatric or joint replacement surgeries except for emergencies starting March 21. On May 7, the Governor issued order 2020-77, which continued the restrictions of the previous stay at home orders with limited exceptions to “critical infrastructure workers,” defined as those “necessary to sustain or protect life.” \n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the Governor did not have the authority to issue executive orders 2020-17 and 2020-77 under the Emergency Powers Act and the Emergency Management Act beyond the 28 days after the announcement of the state of emergency without the approval of the Michigan Legislature. The plaintiffs also claimed that the Emergency Powers Act violated the Separation of Powers and the nondelegation clauses of the Michigan Constitution. The plaintiffs also alleged that the executive orders violated due process and were void for vagueness. The plaintiffs argued that executive order 2020-17 did not give the plaintiffs a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, as the assessment of which medical treatments are deemed essential are largely left to the discretion of healthcare providers. Additionally, they alleged that order 2020-77 did not provide any explicit standards for determining whether particular operations were “critical infrastructure” activity. Lastly, the plaintiffs alleged that the executive orders violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Commerce Clause under the U.S. Constitution. \n\nThe plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendants from enforcing order 2020-17 and 2020-77 on May 18, which was dismissed on May 27.\n\nOn May 28, the court filed a notice of hearing regarding certification of issues to the Michigan Supreme Court. The district court noted that parts of the plaintiff’s complaint presented questions that required interpretation by the Michigan Supreme Court since they had never been considered by the Michigan Court of Appeals or the Michigan Supreme Court before. The following questions were at issue: (1) whether the Governor of Michigan had the authority to renew executive orders related to the pandemic under the Emergency Powers Act and Emergency Management Act; and, (2) whether the Emergency Powers Act violated the separation of powers or nondelegation clauses under the Michigan Constitution? \n\nMichigan’s Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss on June 2, and the Governor of Michigan and Director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services also filed a motion to dismiss on June 5. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the public health benefits of the executive orders outweighed the burden to the plaintiffs. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a dormant Commerce Clause claim. \n\nIn response to the district court’s notice of hearing regarding certification of issues, the plaintiffs submitted a brief requesting the two questions to be taken to the Michigan Supreme Court. The defendants also filed a brief requesting the court to either dismiss the questions as moot, decline jurisdiction of the issues as state law claims, or hold the questions in abeyance pending resolution. A hearing was held on the issue on June 10. \n\nOn June 11, the defendants filed a motion opposing certification. The defendants asked the court to dismiss the questions as state law claims, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment. The request was denied on June 16; instead, the district court certified the two questions. 2020 WL 3248785. The same day, the court stayed the case until the Michigan Supreme Court resolved the state law questions. On June 25, the defendants appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit (No. 20-1650). \n\nOn June 30, the Michigan Supreme Court scheduled an oral argument on the two questions for September 2. 2020 WL 3571909. \n\nThe Michigan Supreme Court held on October 2, 2020 that (1) the Governor lacked authority under the Emergency Management Act to issue or renew any executive orders related to COVID-19 after her first order expired on April 30, 2020; and (2) the Emergency Powers Act violated the Michigan Constitution's nondelegation clause. \n\nThe Court's decision as to the Emergency Management Act was unanimous. Justice Stephen J. Markman explained that the Act's requirement that \"[a]fter 28 days, the governor shall issue an executive order or proclamation declaring the state of disaster terminated, unless a request by the governor for an extension . . . is approved by resolution of both houses of the legislature\" implied that the Governor could not bypass the legislature by issuing an executive order terminating a state of emergency and then immediately declaring a new state of emergency for \"identical reasons.\" \n\nThe Court produced several opinions about the Emergency Powers Act. Justice Markman, joined by Justices Brian K. Zahra and Elizabeth T. Clement, wrote that the Act authorized emergency action by the Governor because the phrase \"public emergency\" included the COVID-19 pandemic. But he held that the Act violated the Michigan Constitution's nondelegation clause because it allowed the Governor to exercise \"a substantial part of the entire police power of the state\" for an \"indefinite duration\" subject only to the constraints that the governor's actions be \"reasonable\" and \"necessary,\" which failed to supply \"genuine guidance to the Governor as to how to exercise the authority delegated [or] constrain[] . . . in any meaningful manner.\"  \n\nJustice David F. Viviano concurred. He noted that the Emergency Powers Act only allowed the Governor to declare emergencies \"when public safety is imperiled\" and argued that public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic did not imperil public safety. \n\nChief Justice Bridget M. McCormack argued that the Emergency Powers Act was constitutional. She noted that the Act allowed only \"reasonable\" and \"necessary\" actions to protect public safety during emergencies, so it supplied an intelligible principle for the Governor as federal nondelegation precedent required. Justices Richard Bernstein and Megan K. Cavanagh agreed; Justice Bernstein also wrote a concurrence expressing similar themes. 2020 WL 5877599.\n\nThe appeal before the Sixth Circuit is pending as of October 5, 2020, and the case is ongoing. \n", "summary": "This lawsuit was filed by four medical providers and an individual seeking medical services to challenge the state’s executive orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The plaintiff alleged that defendants' scheme violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 <i>et seq.</i>, and the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a) <i>et seq.</i> The plaintiff was represented by private counsel.\n\nMohawk moved to dismiss the case. The district court (Judge Harold L. Murphy) denied the motion with respect to the plaintiffs' RICO claims and the claim that the defendant was unjustly enriched by paying wages less than it would have been forced to pay, had it not hired undocumented workers. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim with respect to having fewer workers' compensation claims on account of undocumented workers.  Accordingly, the defendant appealed.

Mohawk's operations, including its use of temporary employment agencies and wage-setting practices, were decentralized; rather than decisions being made on the corporate level, operations were conducted on a facility-by-facility basis, and so the plaintiff class lacked commonality.

{"document": "This case deals with the legality of seizing the property of unhoused individuals by the city of Seattle, Washington without adequate notice. \n\nThe plaintiffs - initially consisting of two individuals, the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia, and the organization Real Change - filed this lawsuit on January 19, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Represented by the ACLU of Washington and private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the City of Seattle, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), and the Secretary of Transportation for WSDOT under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Article 1, § 7 and Article 1, § 3 of the Washington Constitution, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, on their policy of “sweeping.” The City rules governing the sweeps were promulgated as the Multi-Departmental Administrative Rules 08-01 (MDARs), while WSDOT adopted the Guidelines to Address Illegal Encampments.  The plaintiffs claimed that the practice of sweeping seized or destroyed their property without adequate notice, an opportunity to be heard, or a meaningful remedy to reclaim undestroyed property.  The plaintiffs sought class certification, declaratory relief that federal and state constitutions forbid the policies of defendants, injunctive relief forbidding sweeps until constitutionally respective procedures are adopted, and attorney fees. The District Court assigned the case to Judge Ricardo Martinez.\n \nIn the complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the policies of the City violated protections from unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, the right to protection from invasion of home under the Washington State Constitution, and the right to due process under the Washington State Constitution. The City viewed the policies themselves, also referred to as “cleanups,” as necessary for public health and safety. In contrast, the plaintiffs contended that the policy of the City violated constitutional notice requirements for the residents of these encampments and others who lacked a permanent home. Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that items the City of Seattle viewed as “garbage” were in fact constitutionally protected property, thus requiring both due process protections and recovery protections. \n\nA day after filing the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.  The proposed class included all unhoused persons who lived outside within the City of Seattle and who keep their belongings on public property. \n\nOn February 6, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the practice of sweeping. Judge Martinez denied the motion for the TRO on February 14, 2017, finding that the plaintiffs inadequately satisfied their burdens of success on the merits and irreparable harm, but allowed the plaintiffs' concurrent but unfiled motion for a preliminary injunction to proceed. 2017 WL 591112.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 2, 2017, adding another individual and the Trinity Parish of Seattle as plaintiffs.  In response, the City of Seattle filed a counterclaim on March 16, 2017, seeking a declaratory judgment that the City’s newly adopted MDARs was sufficiently constitutional. The new MDARs was set to go into effect on April 2, 2017. The plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint on May 23, 2017, adding an additional individual plaintiff.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on June 14, 2017.  Reviewing the motions for preliminary injunction and class certification in tandem, Judge Martinez denied both motions on October 4, 2017. 2017 WL 4410029. Judge Martinez denied the class certification because the plaintiffs failed to establish commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.  Judge Martinez denied the preliminary injunction because he found plaintiffs failed to demonstrate irreparable harm because speculative injuries are not immediate, threatened injury. Judge Martinez found that the balance of equities and the validity of the public interest weighed in favor of defendants because the speculative claims of plaintiffs did not outweigh the defendants' interest in maintaining public property free of items that may pose a threat to citizens. \n\nOn January 23, 2018, the plaintiffs appealed the denial of the class certification to the Ninth Circuit. Judge Sandra Ikuta, Judge Morgan Christen, and Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves heard the case. The panel affirmed the denial of class certification on November 29, 2019, finding the lack of sufficient evidence and commonality dispositive enough to warrant the District Court’s denial of the class certification. 943 F.3d 882. Concurring in part and dissenting in part, Judge Christen found that the plaintiffs presented distinct facial challenges to the cleanup policies. \n\nWith the Ninth Circuit finding no abuse of discretion by the District Court, the City of Seattle filed a motion to convert the preliminary injunction into a final judgment on the merits on March 5, 2020. The plaintiffs responded on March 12, 2020, by filing a motion to voluntarily dismiss their claims and the City’s counterclaim.

{"document": "On September 1, 2000, the mother of a physically and developmentally disabled individual filed a lawsuit under § 1983 against the Director of Illinois Department of Public Aid (IDPA) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The Plaintiff, represented by Prairie State Legal Services, alleged that a reduction in the level of private-duty nursing provided to her son at home would violate the federal Medicaid statute and deprive her son of due process of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief. \n\nThe Plaintiff's son was diagnosed with brain cancer as a child; as a result of the cancer, a stroke, and subsequent treatment, he presented a very complex medical case requiring round-the-clock care and about 25 medications per day.  From the time between when the Plaintiff's private medical insurance terminated and the time her son turned twenty-one, the Plaintiff's son received sixteen hours of in-home nursing per day under the Medicaid Program for Medically Fragile, Technology Dependent Children (MFTDC program).  After he turned twenty-one, the Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) reduced this to five hours of in-home nursing per day.  The Plaintiff desired community-based treatment, and state treatment professionals found that it was appropriate. The cost of care for the Plaintiff's son in a hospital ($29,000 per month) would exceed the cost of care in his home ($20,000 per month).\n\nOn September 1, 2000, the district court (Judge James B. Zagel) granted the Plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order, requiring IDPA to continue funding at-home care. However, on November 6, 2000 the court denied the Plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction, holding that her complaint did not state a viable federal claim. The Plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, also requesting an injunction pending appeal. However, in February 2001, amendments to the Illinois State Medicaid Plan eliminated private duty nursing care as a service provided under the state plan. Consequently, the Seventh Circuit ordered the District Court to vacate its judgment on the merits and dismiss all previous orders as moot. \n\nOn December 1, 2001, the Plaintiff again filed suit against IDPA, this time in the Circuit Court of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit, DuPage County, Illinois. The original claim alleged violations of various Illinois state laws. After adding claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (\"RA\"), the Plaintiff moved the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on December 14, 2001. \n\nOn April 30, 2002, the Court (Judge John W. Darrah) granted in part and denied in part the Plaintiffs' motion to remand to state court.  The Court remanded Plaintiffs' state law claims and retained jurisdiction of Plaintiffs' federal law claims.\n\nThe Federal Court granted Defendants' motion for judging on the pleadings on September 10, 2002.  The Court held that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals' holding in Walker v. Snyder, 213 F.3d 344 (7th Cir. 2000), required that Plaintiffs' ADA claim under Title II fail.  The Court also dismissed Plaintiffs' RA claims, holding that the RA does not require the State to create and fund a program that does not already exist; instead, the RA requires even-handed treatment of developmentally and physically disabled persons relative to persons who do not have disabilities.\n\nOn September 8, 2004, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Ilana Rovner) reversed the District Court and remanded the case for further proceedings.  Radaszewski v. Garner, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2004).  First, the Court recognized that the Supreme Court's holding in Board of Trustees of Univ. of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001) recognized the right of a private plaintiff to assert an ADA claim for injunctive relief against a state official in federal court.  The Court then proceeded to the merits of Plaintiff's claim and concluded that the Court held that the District Court erred in entering judgment on the pleadings in Defendants' favor.  \n\nOn March 29, 2006, the District Court found that there was no final enforceable settlement agreement between the parties.  Radaszewski v. Maram, 2006 WL 861243 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 29, 2006).  The parties had exchanged numerous settlement offers, both written and verbal, and had submitted memoranda regarding the status of the settlement proceedings.  The parties had disagreed about whether an enforceable settlement agreement had been reached.\n\nThere was a bench trial beginning September 10, 2007.  At the time of trial, the Plaintiff's son was receiving 16 hours of private-duty nursing per day pursuant to the injunction entered by the state court.\n\nThe Court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law after the bench trial on March 26, 2008.  Radaszewski v. Maram, 2008 WL 2097382 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 26, 2008).  The Court held that Plaintiff had sufficiently stated and proved a claim under the ADA and RA.  The Court entered judgment in Plaintiff's favor; the parties were ordered to meet, confer, and submit a proposed order setting forth appropriate relief consistent with the Court's opinion.\n\nOn May 9, 2008, the Court issued a permanent injunction.  The order enjoined the Defendant from reducing coverage for Plaintiff's son to fewer than sixteen hours per day of skilled nursing services at his parents' home.  Plaintiff was also awarded costs and fees, and the Court retained jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing the injunction. \n\nThe case is now closed, and there has been no further litigation.", "summary": "This case was brought on behalf of a developmentally and physically disabled individual against various Illinois state officials alleging that his rights were violated when in-home nursing services were greatly reduced when he turned twenty-one.

{"document": "On February 22, 2007, plaintiffs filed this class action seeking prospective declaratory and injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, basing their lawsuit upon alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;  42 U.S.C. § 1983; and federal common law. They also claimed violations of numerous state constitution provisions, statutes, and regulations governing services for handicapped persons, public accommodations, public assistance programs, health care, and due process. The plaintiffs, also seeking an award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses, were represented by private counsel and attorneys from The Legal Aid Society (New York City) and the Urban Justice Center.  \n\nThe plaintiffs, indigent New York City residents with psychiatric disabilities who are under the supervision of the New York State Division of Parole (\"DOP\"), or who are soon to be released to New York City from a New York State prison under DOP supervision, alleged that their psychiatric disabilities' symptoms interfere with major life activities such as thinking, concentrating, interacting with others, caring for oneself, working, and remembering and processing information.  Qualified to participate in the parole, conditional release or post-release supervision programs (collectively referred to as \"the parole program\"), the plaintiffs asserted that they require disability accommodations in the form of pre-release planning and appropriate transitional services in order to be successful in the parole program and have access to the services it offers. Due to their lack of financial resources, the plaintiffs qualified for one or more public benefits programs, but stated that they required accommodations for their disability in the form of assistance with pre-release applications and post-release services to obtain and maintain access to these benefits programs.  The defendants consisted of the DOP, additional state agencies responsible for mental health and benefits programs, and various state officials administering these agencies.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the release from prison of members of their class without having been provided appropriate pre-release planning services results in a \"revolving door\" system in which they are likely return to prison because they fail while on parole supervision, the state not having accommodated their disabilities.  In this regard, plaintiffs stated that adequate pre-release planning for prisoners with psychiatric disabilities includes assisting them in completing, submitting, and monitoring the processing of applications for public benefits such as Medicaid, Social Security disability benefits, Family Assistance and Safety Net Assistance (collectively referred to as \"Temporary Assistance\"), and Food Stamps, such that those benefits are available to the prisoners promptly upon their release from prison into the Parole Program. Adequate pre-release planning also, they alleged, includes helping prisoners secure community mental health services, supportive housing, and enrollment in vocational, educational and/or substance abuse programs. Their complaint added that parolees with psychiatric disabilities also need continued assistance throughout their time in the parole program with securing benefits, programs and services not secured prior to release, with implementing a coordinated plan of mental health care, and with addressing additional needs or problems that arise while on parole.  \n\nThe case was assigned to District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum.  On several occasions in the ensuing months, she extended the period of time for the defendants to file answers and motions in response to the complaint.  The PACER docket entries for the case reflect that these extensions result from settlement discussions between the parties.  Also, due to the settlement negotiations, the plaintiffs withdrew on April 23, 2007, their motion for class certification without prejudice to the right to re-file it, should no settlement occur.\n\nOn February 14, 2011, after many years of extensions on the defendants' time to answer the complaint, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice. \n\n", "summary": "On February 22, 2007, plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit challenging the lack of pre-release services, also known as discharge planning, for people with psychiatric disabilities being released from New York State prisons.

{"document": "City Attorneys from the City and County of San Francisco (the City) filed this suit on April 5, 2018, challenging the Department of Justice's (DOJ) bulk rescission of documents that provided guidance of the DOJ's interpretation of laws protecting various groups of people. In so doing, the City argued that the DOJ undermined civil rights protections for marginalized communities and undermined regulated entities like the City from being able to effectively comply with federal law. The City argued that the DOJ did not provide a meaningful reason for the rescission, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The City sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and assigned to Magistrate Judge Donna M. Ryu.\n\nThe City argued that these documents provided guidance to various regulated entities and \"helped to protect civil rights of marginalized individuals,\" including \"immigrants, the poor, people of color, and people with disabilities.\" The City argued that the reason given for the rescission was a press release that merely stated the documents were \"unnecessary, inconsistent with existing law, or otherwise improper.\" The City argued this reasoning was conclusory and lacked particularized justifications for specific documents. While some parts of the DOJ website explain the withdrawal of particular documents, the City argued that the DOJ did not provide justification for withdrawing six particularly important documents. These six documents included guidance for state and local governments regarding removing unlawful juvenile offender fees, discrimination protection for disabled individuals, and discrimination protection under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The complaint highlighted that this rescission occurred in the context of a DOJ guided under Attorney Jefferson Sessions that \"has shown a shocking disregard for protecting the rights of vulnerable communities, rolling back civil rights initiatives in a wide variety of areas.\" \n\nThe case has been assigned to Magistrate Judge Donna M.

This new complaint maintained the APA causes of action from the first complaint, but added an additional rescission of DOJ documents in July 2018 to the facts of the case and modified the plaintiff's argument for standing.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs filed the amended complaint, the DOJ filed an additional motion to dismiss on September 27, 2018.

{"document": "On April 28, 2005, Brenda Jean Clustka died by suicide while inside her cell at the Washoe County jail. On November 3, 2005, her daughter and administrator of the estate, represented by two civil rights lawyers, brought a complaint in the District of Nevada (Judge Howard D. McKibben) against the City of Reno, Nevada and two officers of the Reno Police Department.  The plaintiff alleged that the defendants performed, participated, aided and/or abetted in acts that led to the death of Ms. Clutska.  \n\nThe plaintiff alleged that the police officers escorting Ms. Clutska to the jail did not report her apparent earlier attempt to commit suicide while in the back of their police van. The plaintiff brought this action against the police officers for not putting Ms. Clutska on suicide watch and against the City of Reno for not properly training its police officers to deal with this type of situation. The plaintiff alleged a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on the part of the police officers for abridging Ms. Clutska's right to be free from deliberate indifference to risk of suicide. The plaintiff also brought a separate cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of Reno for failing to properly train its police officers with respect to their obligation to report suicide attempts by detainees. Plaintiff sought declaratory that these acts were illegal and unconstitutional, injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages for these alleged violations. A First Amended Complaint, filed on December 12, 2005, added the estate and Clustka's son as plaintiffs in addition to the daughter.\n\nOn August 29, 2006 the defendants, moved for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiffs could not establish a §1983 claim because they could not show that Ms. Clustka was an objectively serious suicide risk while in custody and that the officers failed to take appropriate steps to protect her. The court agreed that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to Clustka's serious medical needs, or that the conduct of the defendants was the actual cause of Clutska's harm sufficient to constitute liability under §1983.  The district court granted the motion for summary judgment and awarded judgment in favor of the defendants on March 8, 2007.\n\nThe plaintiffs then appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.  On July 24, 2009 the 9th Circuit reversed and remanded the case. Conn v. City of Reno, 572 F.3d 1047 (9th Cir. 2009).  The 9th Circuit (Judge Stephen Reinhardt, Judge Mary M Schroeder, and Judge Dorothy W. Nelson) held that a reasonable jury could find that the police officers were liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for their deliberate indifference to Clustka's serious medical need, and that their actions were a cause in fact and a proximate cause of her suicide.\n\nThe defendants petitioned for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.  In their May 6, 2010 petition, the defendants argued that the Ninth Circuit's decision exacerbated a circuit split over §1983 municipal liability for not training law-enforcement officers to diagnose suicide risk, and that the Ninth Circuit created a new circuit split by erroneously imposing on officers a constitutional duty to diagnose and report suicidal tendencies.  On April 4, 2011 the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration in light of <i>Connick v. Thompson</i>, 131 S.Ct. 1350 (2011). In <i>Connick</i>, the Supreme Court addressed the liability of a district attorney's office for its prosecutors on a failure-to-train theory under § 1983.\n\nOn remand and in consideration of <i>Connick</i>, the Ninth Circuit found that the district court had been correct to hold that the municipality was not liable. On September 6, 2011, the Ninth Circuit reinstated its original opinion except for the part on municipal liability. Conn v. City of Reno, 658 F.3d 897 (D. Nev. 2011). On the district court level, the case then proceeded to trial against the two police officers only. \n\nAfter a six-day jury trial, with proceedings beginning March 7, 2012, the jury found in favor of the officers. On March 13, 2012, the plaintiffs had objected to the qualified immunity jury instruction:<blockquote>The jury instruction objected to asks \"whether the officers reasonably misapprehended how the law would govern their situation.'' This is a legal question and one the Ninth Circuit has decided. Should the jury find that the officers were indeed deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of Brenda Clustka, then there can be no qualified immunity because the Ninth Circuit found that law clearly established, and the officers cannot have reasonably misapprehended it.</blockquote>The court denied the objection during the trial proceedings that day. On March 14, 2012, the jury deliberated for approximately three hours before returning a verdict in favor of the defendants. Judgment was entered in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiffs. \n\nA small amount of litigation occurred after trial over the defendants' awards for costs. In an order of September 19, 2012, the court found that as the defendants prevailed on all claims, they were entitled to an award of all allowable costs. In response to the plaintiffs' argument that the court should deny costs because of the plaintiffs' indigency and the the fact that it was a case of substantial public importance, effecting an immediate change in the way suicide threats were handled locally. Considering these circumstances, the court adjusted the costs to reflect the plaintiffs' economic circumstances and the desire not to chill future plaintiffs from bringing actions raising substantial constitutional issues, reducing the costs awarded to the defendants by fifty percent.

{"document": "On November 18, 2014, the plaintiffs, persons with disabilities that require the use of a wheelchair, brought this class action lawsuit against the defendant, Colorado's Regional Transportation District (RTD). The plaintiffs were represented by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition Legal Program and the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center. The plaintiffs alleged disability discrimination under Title II of  the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Judge Christine Arguello presided over this case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. \n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that the defendants did not make their transportation services readily accessible for persons using wheelchairs and in that light rail operators repeatedly denied persons who require the use of wheelchairs access to the light rail.\n\nThe plaintiffs, in particular, alleged that the defendant discriminated in two ways. Firstly, the walkways within their light rail vehicles had narrow walkways that restricted the mobility of persons using wheelchairs. This equated to the vehicles not being readily accessible for wheelchairs which was required under the ADA. And Secondly, despite RTD designating seating locations for persons using wheelchairs, in practice, those locations were often unavailable.  Oftentimes, the light rail operators would allow non-disabled persons that had either a stroller or bicycle to occupy designated wheelchair seating location. And if a person with a stroller or bicycle occupied those areas, the light rail operator sometimes denied transportation services to a person using a wheelchair. Instead of giving priority to persons using wheelchairs--as required by their own policies-- the operator would often refuse access to the person with the wheelchair if someone onboard with a stroller or bicycle already occupied that space. \n\nThe plaintiffs sought class certification, attorney fees and costs, declaratory relief, and an injunction. \n\nAfter a period of discovery and the like, the parties settled.  Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for certification of the class for settlement purposes, and for approval of the preliminary settlement on November 14, 2016.  The Court agreed on April 3, 2017. After a hearing on the settlement, the court finally approved it, along with attorneys fees, on July 11, 2017.\n\nThe settlement agreement had three terms. Firstly, the agreement called for 172 of the light rails vehicles to be retrofitted to accommodate persons that use wheelchairs. The retrofit would make it so that persons using wheelchairs have more mobility within the transportation vehicles. This would allow for wheelchair users to not obstruct other passengers, and that at least two people with wheelchairs can board the vehicles.\n\nSecondly, the settlement agreement required policies that both direct light rail operators to not discriminate against persons with disability the use of a wheelchair, and to train/retrain these operators to ensure that these anti-discriminatory measures are upheld.\n\nAnd thirdly, the agreement required that the defendant pay the plaintiffs’ attorney fees and costs. The court approved the agreed amount of $ 375,000 for attorney fees and costs.\n\nThe court maintains limited jurisdiction over the case for five years to resolve disputes that require court intervention as set forth in the settlement agreement. \n", "summary": "Individuals requiring the use of a wheelchair brought a class action lawsuit against Denver’s Regional Transportation District (RTD) for violating the American with Disabilities Act and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

{"document": "Summary posted to the Clearinghouse on August 4, 2020:\n\nOn May 26, 2011, an agnostic graduating senior at Medina Valley High School, his older brother (a former student at the school), and their parents filed suit against the Medina Valley Independent School District in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Represented by Americans United for Separation of Church and State and by private counsel, the plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, nominal damages, and attorneys’ fees, alleging that the School District had violated their First Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the school district, was in violation of the Establishment Clause by engaging in a course of conduct that included “presenting, sponsoring, encouraging, inviting, or coercing prayers at school and school-sponsored activities and events; displaying and permitting the display of crosses and other religious icons; and retaliating against students who complain[ed] about the unlawful promotion of religion or who decline[d] to participate in religious prayers, practices, or rituals.”\n\nThe plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on the same day that they filed their complaint, hoping to enjoin the school district from featuring prayer at the upcoming high school graduation ceremony scheduled for June 4, 2011, two weeks after the complaint was filed. After a hearing on May 31, the District Court (Judge Fred Biery) granted their motion on June 1, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits and that failing to issue an injunction would result in irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. It ordered the terms “invocation” and “benediction” stricken and any official group prayer removed from the graduation program.\n\nThe school district made an emergency interlocutory appeal to the Fifth Circuit, and on June 3, 2011, a three-judge panel (Judges W. Eugene Davis, Jerry E. Smith and Leslie H. Southwick) issued a per curiam opinion granting the motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The panel stated that they were not persuaded that the plaintiffs were “substantially likely to prevail on the merits, particularly on the issue that the individual prayers or other remarks to be given by students at graduation were, in fact, school-sponsored.”\n\nThe injunction was dissolved, and although the terms “invocation” and “benediction” had already been removed from the printed program, the graduation ceremony the following day included prayer as originally planned. \n\nOn July 11, 2011, the district court urged the parties to attempt to settle rather than engage in protracted litigation, and the parties agreed to try mediation. At the end of the summer, however, they reported that they had been unable to reach an agreement.\n\nOn September 6, 2011, the school district moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. This motion was mooted by the plaintiffs’ submission of an amended complaint on November 2, but the school district submitted a second motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction on December 9, 2011. A month later, the district moved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs subsequently moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of school prayer.\n\nThe court never ruled on any of these motions, however, because the parties were able to settle their dispute in February 2012. On February 8, they submitted a joint motion to approve a proposed agreement. Under the terms of the settlement, the school district agreed to stop initiating, soliciting, or directing prayers at school events, displaying religious symbols and texts at schools, and inviting religious speakers to proselytize, or to play any part in writing or editing student graduation speeches. It further agreed to train its staff in how to comply with the agreement, educate students on religious diversity, and refrain from retaliating against or disparaging the plaintiffs. The agreement allowed student-led prayer at events.  The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement for ten years.\n\nOn February 9, 2012, the court entered a consent decree approving the settlement.\n\nThe following month, the court was called upon to enforce it—the school superintendent and the high school band director each made statements that could be construed as disparaging of the plaintiffs (the former referring to the lawsuit as a “witch hunt” and the latter calling the plaintiffs liars) shortly after the settlement was approved.\n\nOn March 19, 2012, the court issued an order requiring the district to apologize, and requiring the plaintiffs to accept the apology.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a suit brought by a church against the State of Colorado's enforcement of stay-at-home orders, including the policy prohibiting in-person religious activities. Following a Supreme Court decision denying a similar application for injunctive relief, plaintiffs withdrew their request for injunctive relief. They later filed an amended complaint and a renewed motion for TRO and preliminary injunction, which was denied on June 16. <hr>\n\nThe \"safer at home\" executive orders issued by Colorado Governor Jared Polis in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 prohibited religious gatherings of over 10 people. High Plains Harvest Church, a small, rural church, and one of its pastors alleged that the orders violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Represented by private counsel, plaintiffs sued Governor Polis and the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado under 42 U.S.C.§ 1983 on May 25, 2020. The plaintiffs, who simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order (TRO), sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' costs and fees. The case was assigned to Judge Raymond P. Moore and Magistrate Judge Michael E. Hegarty.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the executive orders were unconstitutional both facially and as-applied, violating their freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and equal protection rights. The plaintiffs asserted that the orders burdened their sincerely held religious beliefs by \"permit[ing] other similarly situated businesses or non-religious entities to continue while prohibiting faith-based gatherings.\" Moreover, the plaintiffs claimed that the orders violated their \"freedom of speech by prohibiting them from engaging in religious speech through their church services.\" Finally, plaintiffs contended that the orders, which permitted \"critical businesses\" such as grocery, gun, and hardware stores to remain open, violated their equal protection rights by \"impermissibly discriminat[ing[ between certain non-religious gatherings and religious or faith-based gatherings.\" Plaintiffs sought an injunction or TRO enjoining defendants from enforcing the executive orders against plaintiffs and an order declaring the orders unconstitutional. 2020 WL 2630282. \n\nIn their May 28 response to the motion for TRO, defendants asserted that \"the purpose of these orders is to protect the public from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" not to target or discriminate against plaintiffs' first amendment rights. Defendants argued that the plaintiffs had \"no reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of their claims\" because the orders were enacted in good faith and in furtherance of public safety. \n\nThe next day, the United States Department of Justice filed a statement of interest, stating that \"The Court should grant the plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, and Plaintiffs’ group prayer should be allowed to proceed without fear of prosecution.\" The DOJ explained \"that because Colorado appears to be treating similarly situated non-religious activity, such as in-person dining in restaurants, better than places of worship these actions may constitute a violation of the church’s constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.\" \n\nThat same day, the Supreme Court, in <a href=\"https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17575\">South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom</a>, denied an application for injunctive relief similar to the relief sought in this case. There, the Supreme Court stated that the \"restrictions [on places of worship] appear consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\"\n\nOn May 30, in light of the Supreme Court's decision, the plaintiffs withdrew the request for preliminary relief. \n\nOn June 1, the defendants filed a status report containing draft guidelines for restrictions on places of worship. The guidelines suggested an indoor capacity of no more than 50% or 50 people, along with social distancing, masks, and sanitation measures.\n\nIn the next few days, thousands of people protested police violence. On June 10, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, alleging that the defendants “permitted and encouraged these protest gatherings while continuing to impose draconian restrictions on religious gatherings.” Concurrently, they filed a renewed motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. \n\nThe court denied the motion on June 16, stating that the \"notion that the non-enforcement of social distancing during a protest means that the State is engaged in a variety of constitutional misconduct directed at religious institutions is far from apparent\" and that \"the assertion that Defendants are treating Plaintiffs differently from comparable secular gatherings is 'improbable.'\"\n\nThe case is ongoing.
