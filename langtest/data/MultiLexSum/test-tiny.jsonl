{"document": "On March 8th, 2014, several citizens of Montgomery, Alabama, who had been imprisoned for failing to pay traffic fines, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, under 42 U.S.C. §1983, against the City of Montgomery, Alabama. The plaintiffs, represented by Equal Justice Under Law and private counsel, asked the court for a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs' rights were violated, compensation for the damages caused by the city's conduct, and attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs alleged they did not have the ability to pay for the traffic tickets and that the City should not have imprisoned them for failing to pay the traffic tickets when they did not attempt to determine whether the plaintiffs had an ability to pay.\n\nOn May 1, 2014, the district court (Judge Mark E. Fuller) granted a motion for a preliminary injunction. The injunction enjoined the city from attempting to collect monies owed to the city associated with traffic tickets by the plaintiffs. The city was also required to submit a comprehensive plan on how they will determine an individual's ability to pay for traffic fines. On August 20, 2014, the case was reassigned to Judge Myron H. Thompson, and on August 21, 2014, Judge Thompson extended the injunction until the court ordered a change.\n\nOn October 31, 2014, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the case because they entered into a settlement agreement about the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court granted this dismissal on November 17, 2014, and the court agreed to the plaintiffs’ request to maintain jurisdiction over the settlement in case of any breaches by the defendant. \n\nWithin the settlement, the Municipal Court of the City of Montgomery agreed to numerous changes in its operations, including using a microphone in its courtroom proceedings, notifying this plaintiff's counsel within 12 hours of a defendant being jailed for nonpayment of a fine, and training public defenders and prosecutors on compliance with Bearden v. Georgia and Turner v. Rodgers. The terms of the settlement agreement lasted up to three years.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Judge Thompson formally closed the case, though the court retained jurisdiction over the settlement and allowed the parties to resolve the issue of attorneys' fees, which was subsequently resolved on January 16, 2015. \n\nOn April 2, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice with the court that the defendants willfully violated the settlement agreement. The matter seemed to be resolved quickly because on April 7, 2015, Judge Thompson ordered that no further action would be taken on the notice because defendants had taken corrective action. \n\nThe case is now closed.", "summary": "The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit on March 8, 2014, alleging that the City of Montgomery, Alabama, improperly imprisoned them for failing to pay traffic fines. They alleged that they did not have an ability to pay the fines due to their financial circumstances and that the city did not consider their ability to pay. On May 1, 2014, the District Court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the city from collecting more money from traffic tickets of plaintiffs'.

{"document": "On August 28, 2013, an indigent detainee in the Montgomery Municipal Jail filed this lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama. The plaintiff sued the City of Montgomery and the Honorable Milton J. Westry under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The petitioner, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, requested the court quash the Municipal Court order requiring the petitioner to serve an imprisonment term of 54 days. Petitioner claimed that the Municipal Court order violated  Sixth Amendment, due process, and equal protection clause. The plaintiff was an indigent woman who accumulated $2,714.00 in fines and fees on traffic tickets that she received in 2008 and 2009. On August 20, 2013, the plaintiff was arrested and brought to the Montgomery Municipal Jail. The next day, the plaintiff appeared before Defendant Judge Westry, who told the plaintiff that she must pay $1,554.00 immediately or serve 31 days in jail. When the plaintiff informed Judge Westry that she would not be able to pay after only recently securing a part-time job, Judge Westry ordered the that her outstanding fines be converted into a term of imprisonment in the Montgomery Municipal Jail. Petitioner was not appointed a lawyer during the previously described court proceeding. \n\nAfter filing an emergency petition for writ of certiorari, the case was removed from state court to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama on October 4, 2013. On the same day, the petitioner filed an amended complaint, seeking declaratory relief.  Another indigent detainee filed a similar suit after he was taken into custody to serve a 54 day sentence for his inability to pay his traffic fees. Cleveland v. City of Montgomery, 2014 WL 6461900, at *1 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). On October 28, 2013,  the petitioner filed a motion to consolidate both cases. On November 12, 2013, petitioners amended their complaint and additionally sought injunctive relief.  Judge Mark E. Fuller granted the motion to consolidate both cases on November 14, 2013. \n \nDiscovery began on December 23, 2013. During discovery, a similar case raising comparable claims,  Mitchell v. City of Montgomery, was filed. 2014 WL 6461900, at *1 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). The court in Mitchell v. City of Montgomery entered a preliminary injunction that ordered the City of Montgomery to submit a comprehensive set of judicial procedures to implement for the collection of future fines. On May 14, 2014, petitioners motioned to have limited participation in the Mitchell v. City of Montgomery hearing regarding the proposed judicial procedures. 2014 WL 6461900, at *2 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). On May 27, 2014, Judge Fuller granted the petitioners’ motion in part and denied it in part. Judge Fuller determined that the petitioners were only permitted to participate in the Mitchell hearings orally and through ancillary briefings to provide perspective on the legal sufficiency of the City’s proposed plan. Cleveland v. City of Montgomery, 300 F.R.D. 578, 581 (M.D. Ala.

Nov 17, 2014). On August 28, 2014, both parties submitted a joint motion to approve the proposed settlement agreement. In the initial agreement, both parties submitted an agreement to pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys fees and provide a list of basic premises and procedures that the Montgomery Municipal Court would abide by with regards to indigent defendants unable to pay any court-ordered monies, including fines, court costs, or restitution. The parties filed an amended joint motion for entry of agreed settlement order on September 12, 2014. The amended motion included a joint brief in support and requested that the court issue three declarations: <blockquote> (1) Under the current status of the law,  the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983), regarding incarceration for non-payment, and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S.Ct. 2507, 180 L.Ed.2d 452 (2011), regarding notice, apply in municipal-court proceedings, and that, to the extent applicable in a particular case, the judges of the Montgomery Municipal Court are legally required to follow them.\n(2) that the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the constitutional principles set out in Bearden, regarding incarceration for non-payment, and Turner, regarding notice. In Bearden, the Supreme Court held that, under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause, a trial court cannot “automatically revok[e] probation because [a] petitioner could not pay his fine, without determining that petitioner had not made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay or that adequate alternative forms of punishment did not exist.” 461 U.S. at 662.\n(3) the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the requirements of the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, §§ 13, 64, and 225 of the Alabama Constitution, and Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. </blockquote>2014 WL 6461900, at *3-5 (M.D. Ala.

In the amended complaint, petitioners alleged that the imprisonment orders violated their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. Petitioners sought remedy through injunctive and declaratory relief. In 2014, the parties reached a settlement that provided new judicial procedures for the Municipal Court to follow regarding indigent defendants and nonpayment. It also included three declarations, most importantly, it declared that the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S.

{"document": "On May 1, 2006, an inmate awaiting execution at the Supermax Unit of the Arkansas Department of Correction filed this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Represented by the Federal Public Defender, the inmate claimed that the procedures used to carry out lethal injections in Arkansas—specifically the use of potassium chloride in the lethal cocktail of drugs—risked unnecessary conscious suffering in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief against the execution practices employed by the Arkansas Department of Corrections (ADC). He did not challenge his sentence or challenge the use of lethal injection. \n\nOn May 4, 2006, a second death row inmate in Arkansas moved to intervene. A few days later, his execution was scheduled for July 5 of that year. On May 26, the district court (Judge Susan Webber Wright) allowed him to intervene as a plaintiff. \n\nOn June 16, following his addition to the case, the second plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from carrying out executions in accordance with the lethal injection protocol. At the hearing on the motion, a medical expert testified that the state's lethal injection procedure created medically unacceptable risks of inflicting pain and suffering. Judge Wright granted the motion on June 26, noting that the plaintiff had not delayed in filing to intervene because he had had to wait to exhaust all of his appeals. The order granting the preliminary injunction stayed the State of Arkansas from implementing the order for execution of the second plaintiff. And four days later, the defendants appealed.\n\nIn the midst of ruling on the preliminary injunction appeal, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint, arguing that the plaintiff could not state a claim. First, they argued that the plaintiff had not exhausted all of the remedies available to him under the Department of Correction’s grievance policy. Second, the claim fell outside the statute of limitations for § 1983 actions. Judge Wright disagreed and denied the motion to dismiss on June 19, 2006. \n\nOn November 22, 2006, a third death row inmate sought to intervene. On December 1, 2006, Judge Wright granted the motion. \n\nOn July 7, 2007 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the preliminary injunction granted by the district court and vacated the stay of execution issued to the second plaintiff. The Court of Appeals found that the district court abused its discretion in granting the stay of execution and the preliminary injunction. Because the inmate could have brought his § 1983 claim before it was necessary to grant a stay, the district court exceeded the scope of its power to grant the preliminary injunction. 491 F.3d 804.\n\nOn July 17, 2007 the defendants filed for summary judgment. They argued that Arkansas's lethal injection protocol was substantially identical to the protocol used by the state of Missouri, which was upheld against constitutional challenge by the Eighth Circuit in <i>Taylor v. Crawford</i>, 487 F.3d 1072 (8th Cir. 2007). In their reply to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs argued that they had not been provided with the opportunity to engage in discovery, and that a significant number of genuine issues of material fact remained even without discovery. \n\nOn August 5, 2008 the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dissolved the stay of execution. The district court relied on the Eighth Circuit's approval of Missouri's lethal injection protocol, which the court found was sufficiently similar to Arkansas' protocol. The district court found that the plaintiffs had failed to come forward with evidence that Arkansas' protocol for execution by lethal injection \"subject[ed] them to constitutionally significant risk of pain.\"\n\nOn August 29, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an appeal. On February 8, 2010 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's summary judgment for the defendants. The Court found that Arkansas' protocol was substantially similar to Missouri's protocol upheld by the Court of Appeals and to Kentucky's protocol upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, the United States Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari. At the time of this writing, the original plaintiff had not been executed. The second plaintiff was granted a stay in 2017. The third plaintiff was executed on April 24, 2017. The case is now closed.

The plaintiffs sued Maricopa County and Treatment Assessment Screening Center, Incorporated, a private company, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Civil Rights Corps and private counsel, sought injunctive and monetary relief, claiming violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs alleged that the Maricopa County Attorney's Office and Treatment Assessment Screening Center jointly operated a marijuana possession diversion program that discriminated against the poor in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and led to unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, the defendants were, under threat of felony prosecution, subject to longer terms of imprisonment, repeated drug tests and increased fee payments due to their inability to pay fees associated with the program. One class member individually sought injunctive relief to prevent Maricopa County from keeping her in the diversion program if she could not pay the fees associated with completing the program. The case was assigned to Judge James A. Teilborg but immediately reassigned to Judge Steven P. Logan.\n\nOn October 12, 2018, the case was reassigned to Judge James A. Soto.

Magistrate Judge Eric J. Markovich denied all these motions in a June 18, 2019 order (2019 WL 2515950). He stated that the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded the elements of a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim and that, because the violations of rights were ongoing, there is no statute of limitations concerns. As for the Treatment Assessment Screening Center, he stated that the group was not subject to qualified immunity because it was being sued as an organization, not in individual capacity. He also wrote that the County Attorney was eligible for suit because he oversaw what the plaintiffs allege is a discriminatory practice. He added that as a municipality, the County Attorney was not subject to sovereign immunity.  \n\nOn September 23, 2019, the plaintiffs submitted a second amended complaint adding another representative to the class.

{"document": "On March 8, 2006, the Pacific News Service filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the California Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants had violated the constitutional rights of the press and the public to attend, meaningfully observe, and gather and report on important information at executions being carried out by the defendants at the California State Prison at San Quentin. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants' use of pancuronium bromide, a paralytic agent, acted as a chemical curtain over the lethal injection process. The plaintiffs alleged that this chemical made it impossible for witnesses to determine whether the executed inmates were being subjected to substantial and unnecessary pain before dying. As a result, the plaintiffs claimed that the witnesses were denied the information necessary for the public to decide whether and how executions should be conducted.\n\nOn the same day the plaintiffs filed the lawsuit, they asked the court to consolidate their case with Morales v. Woodford (<a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9823\">CJ-CA-0004</a> in this Clearinghouse). On March 28, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Judge Jeremy Fogel) denied without prejudice the request to consolidate the cases.  \n\nOn October 10, 2010, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim in response to the plaintiffs' second amended complaint. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs did not have a First Amendment right to dictate the method that the state uses to perform a lethal injection execution. Furthermore, the defendants argued that there were legitimate and constitutional reasons for using pancuronium bromide. \n\nOn November 3, 2011, the court entered a scheduling order that included a discovery cut-off date, but the plaintiffs moved to vacate the order and to direct the parties to submit a new proposed schedule \"when viable lethal injection regulations are in place.\" On April 5, 2012 court denied the motion to vacate the scheduling order, reasoning that the ongoing state case, <i>Sims v. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation </i> (CDCR), could affect this case when concluded and therefore the motion was premature. In <i>Sims v. CDCR</i>, the Marin County Superior Court had issued a judgment on February 21, 2012 and held that CDCR failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. The state court had issued an injunction prohibiting CDCR from executing anyone until new lethal injection regulations complied with the APA.\n\nIn July 2012, the parties stipulated that the court should vacate the current scheduling order.

{"document": "On April 20, 2012, a state prisoner filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. The plaintiff sued the California Department of Corrections under §1983 and California state administrative law. Represented by UnCommon Law, he asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that officials of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and its Board of Parole Hearings, acted unfairly by refusing to authentically consider the appropriateness of parole for prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment. \n\nOn October 18, 2012, Magistrate Judge Gregory G. Hollows granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, but allowed the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 28 days. 2012 WL 5187779. On November 15, 2012, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging with more detail that officials of the State of California--including the Governor, the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), and various officials of the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH)--implemented a system to fabricate evidence to support their decisions to deny parole, particularly for inmates serving a life sentence (\"Lifers\"), and that this discriminatory scheme was used to protect their decisions from judicial scrutiny so that they could maintain the low rate of granting parole to Lifers. \n\nOn March 31, 2014, U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification of a class consisting \"of California state prisoners who are serving life sentences and are eligible.\" Judge Mueller also granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs' equal protection and state law claims, but denied the defendants' summary judgment motion as to the plaintiffs' due process claims. 2014 WL 1309289. The defendants appealed this decision but their petition for permission to appeal was denied on June 12, 2014. \n\nOn September 26, 2014, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Magistrate Judge Claire recommended be denied in part and granted in part. Though the defendants objected to the magistrate's findings and recommendations, they were adopted by the District Court in a May 14, 2015 order. 2015 WL 2358583. As a result, the defendants got judgment on counts four (alleging \"that their Due Process rights ha[d] been violated by the denial of 'notice of the evidence being used to consider their suitability for parole.'\"), five (alleging \"that the refusal to provide access to the data underlying the FAD reports also deprive[d] them of their Due Process right to be heard at their parole hearings\"), nine (alleging \"that they ha[d] a 'limited' Due Process right to 'confront and cross examine [the] putative experts' whose FAD reports [were] used to deny plaintiffs parole\"), and twelve (alleging \"that they ha[d] a Due Process right to call witnesses, including adverse witnesses, at their parole hearings\") of the plaintiff's complaint. The Court allowed the plaintiffs to, within 30 days, file an amended complaint as to the remaining counts. The plaintiff decided against amending a complaint. \n\nIn a joint status report filed on July 17, 2015, the parties indicated that they had entered into negotiations and were working toward a settlement. On October 2, 2015, the parties entered into a finalized stipulation and settlement agreement, which required reforms in the psychological risk assessment process used by the parole board, including an opportunity for Lifers to challenge factual errors in risk assessments through counsel. The defendants also agreed to consult experts on the use of risk assessments in the correctional setting and make information presented by the Board of Parole Hearing's Psychologist available to the plaintiffs and be posted online. Furthermore, the Court was to retain jurisdiction over this case until January 1, 2017. If within 30 days after January 1, 2017, the plaintiffs believed that the defendants had not abided by the terms of the settlement, the plaintiffs could seek an extension of the Court's jurisdiction over this matter for no more than 12 months. \n\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, once the Agreement was approved, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed all but one of the defendants--the Executive Officer of the Board of Parole Hearings. The plaintiffs' motion to do so was granted in an order by Magistrate Judge Claire on June 24, 2016.\n\nThe issue of attorneys fees was raised in a separate motion on October 16, 2015, which was referred to Magistrate Judge Claire. On November 10, 2015, she granted the plaintiff's motion for attorneys fees, and the defendants had 30 days to pay $119,796.05 to the plaintiff. The defendants challenged this order, filing a motion for Reconsideration of Timing of Fee and Cost Payment. On December 1, 2015, Magistrate Judge Claire granted the defendant's request for reconsideration and edited the last sentence of the court's order to read: \"Defendants shall remit payment to Plaintiffs' counsel in the amount of $119,796.05, within thirty (30) days after the Court grants final approval of the parties Amended Stipulated Settlement, subject to interest thereafter as provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1961.\"\n\nOn October 6, 2017, the court extended its jurisdiction for another year, finding that the defendants had not complied fully with the Settlement.

As Doraville’s City Council heavily relied on these revenues to balance the city’s budget, its municipal court personnel, who serve at the pleasure of the City Council, had a financial incentive to convict defendants. In addition, the city’s law enforcement personnel, who also ultimately serve at the pleasure of its City Council, had an incentive to ticket and prosecute to raise revenue. \n\nOn May 23, 2018, four individuals who had been ticketed or threatened to be ticketed by the City of Doraville filed this lawsuit in U.S. District Court Northern District of Georgia. The case was assigned to Judge Richard W. Story. Represented by Strickland Brockington Lewis, LLP, and the Institute for Justice, the plaintiffs sued the City of Doraville under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and the Declaratory Judgments Act. The plaintiffs alleged that the City’s policy and practice of using its law enforcement and municipal court system for revenue generation violated the plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, the complaint claimed that the “financial incentive to ticket and prosecute injects an unconstitutional financial bias or an appearance of such bias into law enforcement and prosecutorial discretion.” The plaintiffs sought declarative and injunctive relief from Doraville’s policy and practice of budgeting to receive revenues from fines and fees. \n\nThe defendant sought to dismiss the complaint on July 2, 2018, claiming that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and the complaint failed to state a claim as a matter of law. On April 1, 2019, the court (Judge Richard Story) denied in part the motion to dismiss. The court found that the plaintiffs successfully alleged standing, as the complaint is replete with allegations showing that plaintiffs were personally harmed, and are likely to be harmed in the future, from the city’s allegedly unlawful actions. Regarding the complaint’s failure to state a claim as a matter of law, the court found itself “unable to adequately assess whether Plaintiffs’ claims are legally cognizable...as a result of the paucity of relevant case law.” As such, the court ordered a hearing to address the proper standard of review and its application in this case. 2019 WL 3557893. This hearing was held on June 4, 2019. \n\nAfter reconsidering the motion to dismiss, the court denied the motion on July 9, 2019.

{"document": "On May 22, 2012, several national and local news agencies filed a § 1983 lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, Southern Division, against the state of Idaho. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the policy of the Idaho Department of Correction to prohibit public viewing of the preparatory phase of the execution process, during which the inmate is restrained and the IV is inserted, violates the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.\n\nAlong with their complaint, plaintiffs filed an expedited motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to have the procedures in question enjoined before the execution of Richard Leavitt on June 12. The District Court (Judge Edward J. Lodge) granted the motion to expedite on May 24, but on June 5 the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Lodge found that while the plaintiffs have a strong case on the merits and the public has an interest in viewing an execution in its entirety, the motion was not filed in a timely manner, and to allow it would disrupt a scheduled execution that the public has an even greater interest in seeing carried out.\n\nPlaintiffs immediately filed an interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit. On June 8, 2012, the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court. A three-judge panel (Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, Judge Stephen R. Reinhardt, and Judge Marsha S. Berzon) stated in an opinion by Judge Reinhardt that its ruling in California First Amendment Coalition v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 868 (9th Cir. 2002), had clearly indicated that Idaho's policy was unconstitutional for the reasons noted by the plaintiffs, that Idaho had had a decade to correct this policy, and thus that any problems of timing were the fault of the state and not of the plaintiffs. It further found that the District Court had abused its discretion in balancing the four elements the plaintiff must prove for a preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the appeals panel reversed the District Court and remanded for entry of an injunction prior to the execution of Richard Leavitt.\n\nThe District Court (Judge Lodge) entered an injunction on June 11 and directed the parties to submit a joint litigation plan by June 22. \n\nOn July 10, 2012, Judge Lodge entered a permanent injunction ordering the Idaho Department of Corrections, and responsible parties associated therewith, to modify their procedures to allow the witnesses to the execution of a condemned inmate to observe the entire execution from the moment the inmate enters the execution chamber through, to and including, the time the inmate is declared dead. \n\nThe case is now closed.\n\n\n", "summary": "On May 22, 2012, several national and local news agencies filed a § 1983 lawsuit against the state of Idaho, alleging that the policy of the Idaho Department of Correction to prohibit public viewing of the preparatory phase of the execution process, during which the inmate is restrained and the IV is inserted, violates the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.

{"document": "On December 12, 2016, seven prisoners in the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs sued the State of Illinois and its attorney general under 42 U.S.C. §1983.  Represented by private counsel, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Illinois, by its policies regarding individuals convicted of sex-related offenses, had violated their rights under the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments.  The case was assigned to Judge Virginia M. Kendall.\n\nIndividuals convicted of certain sex-related offenses under Illinois law are subject to overlapping statutory and regulatory schemes that make it difficult for prisoners to satisfy conditions required for their release from prison. The Illinois Unified Code of Corrections provides that for all felony convictions, the sentencing court must provide within the sentencing order a term of parole or mandatory supervised release (MSR). Individuals convicted after July 1, 2005 of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual criminal assault, or criminal sexual assault, and individuals convicted after January 1, 2009 of aggravated child pornography or manufacturing or dissemination of child pornography were subject to a mandatory indeterminate term of MSR. The indeterminate duration of MSR could range from three years to life: an individual could only apply for termination of his indeterminate MSR sentence after completing three years of MSR outside of prison. A prisoner could not receive credit for MSR time served while in custody.\n\nThe Prison Review Board (PRB) required that before inmates could be released from IDOC custody, they had to have an approved “host site” to reside at while serving their MSR term.  IDOC only approved host sites that met all housing restrictions imposed by statute, by IDOC, and by the Prison Review Board.  Illinois did not provide housing resources for inmates, and halfway homes and homeless shelters automatically rejected individuals with sex-related convictions. Each plaintiff had either submitted multiple host sites and been denied by the IDOC, or was indigent and had no housing options to select for their host site. The plaintiffs alleged that the multiple restrictions created an unmeetable condition that forced them to spend the duration of their MSR term incarcerated. For the plaintiffs that were given an indeterminate MSR sentence, the unmeetable conditions resulted in life imprisonment. \n\t\nOn February 17, 2017, IDOC moved to dismiss the complaint on three grounds:<ol><li>Two of the plaintiffs’ claims lacked standing because they had not yet completed their incarceration sentences; <li>The plaintiffs’ claim against the duration of their confinement should have been raised as a habeas action, not under 42 U.S.C. §1983; and <li>The plaintiffs’ claims failed to allege sufficient facts for their constitutional claims.</ol>On August 18, 2017, the court granted in part IDOC’s motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs did not need to file a habeas action in order to receive the requested relief, and that all constitutional claims were appropriate except for the due process claim.  The court granted, however, IDOC’s motion to dismiss with respect to two plaintiffs because their claims were based on post-release conditions and the plaintiffs had not yet been released. She further granted the motion with respect to the plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim because of vagueness.\n\nOn December 6, 2017,  the plaintiffs moved for class certification and appointment of class counsel. They sought to certify a class of inmates who had completed their sentenced term and were currently detained in the IDOC and denied release because of their inability to find an approved host site.  The court approved the unopposed motion on April 6, 2018, defining the class as all individuals sentenced to serve “three-years-to-life” on MSR, currently detained in IDOC, who have been approved for release on MSR but have been denied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an approved host site. Once discovery ended, both parties sought summary judgment. On March 31, 2019, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment in part and denied IDOC’s cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\nThe court held that the state’s host site requirement resulted in the continued deprivation of the plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights. The court also addressed whether the proper vehicle to bring the plaintiffs’ claims was 42 U.S.C. §1983 or a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and determined that the plaintiffs properly brought their claims under 42 U.S.C. §1983 because they were not seeking release from custody, but rather the proper application of law to their situation. The court found that there was a genuine issue material fact as to whether IDOC offered a procedure for determining the validity of a decision to deny a host site, and denied summary judgment on that claim.\n\nBoth parties met on May 1, 2019, for a settlement conference and held further status hearings on June 18, 2019, October 1, 2019, December 3, 2019, January 2, 2020.\n\nOn January 15, 2020, the court granted a permanent injunction. According to the order, IDOC was required to present a plan, as well as quarterly reports outlining steps that would be taken to ensure that by January 2, 2021, no class member would remain in IDOC custody due to an inability to locate a host site. \n\nOn January 29, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a bill of costs, and on February 18, 2020, the court awarded costs to the plaintiffs in the amount of $3,015.41.\n\nOn February 27, 2020, IDOC presented a compliance plan to the court, pursuant to the injunction.  The plan outlined the steps that IDOC had already taken to assist class members, such as host site policy changes and a review of host site denials.  It also outlined additional steps that IDOC was then undertaking to release class members, such as finalizing a Request for Proposal for licensed transitional housing locations for sex offenders, and cooperation with the Illinois Department of Human Services to identify appropriate placements and/or services for class members who would likely qualify for that department’s services upon their release.\n\nOn June 15, 2020, IDOC presented a quarterly report further outlining the steps that it was then taking to release class members. \n\nAs of July 2020, the court’s supervision of the settlement is ongoing.\n", "summary": "In 2016, prisoners that had completed their sentences but remained incarcerated by the Illinois Department of Corrections filed this class action against the state in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

The plaintiff sued Dodge City and Ford County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff alleged that the Dodge City's wealth-based post-arrest detention scheme violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and a declaratory judgment that the City's wealth-based detention practices were unlawful.  \n\nThe plaintiff, a Native American citizen of Dodge City, was arrested and held at the Ford County Jail because he could not pay $250 to the City of Dodge City. In Dodge City, arrestees faced two different outcomes depending on their wealth status: Wealthy arrestees paid an amount set by the bail schedule and were not held in jail, while poor arrestees were put in jail for 48 hours because they could not afford to pay the City's pre-determined bail for their offense. Bail amounts ranged from $250-$2500. Under the City's scheme, the sole criterion for determining whether a pretrial arrestee walked free or sat in jail was the amount of money that he had. The plaintiff alleged that this policy and practice of using a fixed \"bail schedule\" to determine the amount of money necessary to secure post-arrest release and the practice of requiring cash up-front to avoid post-arrest detention violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.\n\nThe plaintiff sought to certify a class on behalf of himself and all other arrestees unable to pay for their release pursuant to Dodge City's fixed bail schedule who were, are, or who will become in the custody of Dodge City.

James) granted motions to stay all proceedings to allow the parties to explore a non-litigation resolution.\n\nOn April 22, 2016, the parties submitted a joint motion for entry of final declaratory and injunctive relief and joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice. On April 26, 2016, the court (Judge Daniel D.

{"document": "On November 30, 2015, a resident of Clark County, Kentucky, who was arrested and admitted to jail filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky against the Clark County Detention Center (Jail). The complaint alleged that the Jail wrongly deprived the plaintiffs of property without due process of law and charged costs of their incarceration absent court order, including for plaintiffs who were subsequently acquitted. The complaint alleged that this violated Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) §441.265, and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel. \n\nThe individual plaintiff who filed the suit had been arrested and admitted to the Jail on October 26, 2013; he remained incarcerated until his release on December 15, 2014. Plaintiff maintained that the criminal charges for which he was incarcerated were dismissed midway on April 2, 2015, because the plaintiff proved he was entirely innocent of such offenses. After release, plaintiff received a written demand from the Jail to pay in excess of $4,000 in fees relating to his incarceration. As of November 30, 2015, the plaintiff paid $20 and refused to pay the remaining balance on the grounds that KRS §441.265 allowed a jail to charge detainees the costs of their confinement only with a court order and consideration of the detainee's financial obligations. Moreover, the plaintiff alleged, the jail could not charge innocent detainees and was required to accounting for the funds collected. The plaintiff further maintained that if KRS §441.265 is interpreted otherwise, then it violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the Kentucky Constitution. \n\nThe plaintiff sought both compensatory and punitive damages arising from the conduct of the defendants, and declaratory judgment and permanent injunction of the practice. \n\nOn January 14, 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's claims.

Judge Hood found, moreover, that the facts pleaded did not rise to the level of a substantive due process violation and that the state had a legitimate interest in recouping costs from inmates.

{"document": "On August 7, 2017, two residents of East Baton Rouge Parish filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued East Baton Rouge Parish and Rehabilitation Home Incarceration (RHI) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), and state law. The case was assigned to Judge Shelly D. Dick. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center, sought monetary relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had violated federal and state anti-racketeering law, Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. \n\nAccording to the plaintiffs, RHI purported to provide pretrial supervision services and profited from individuals in East Baton Rouge Parish by requiring them to pay hundreds of dollars to RHI to be released from jail, effectively holding them for ransom. People awaiting trial before a criminal court were coerced into paying hundreds of dollars to companies before and after they were released from jail, even after paying bail. The complaint alleged that RHI turned pre-trial release into a for-profit concern that fueled wealth-based incarceration, harming low-income people who had not been convicted of a crime. \n\n The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding the Sheriff of East Baton Rouge as a defendant on August 8, 2017. A few days later the plaintiffs filed a notice voluntarily dismissing East Baton Rouge Parish as a defendant. On September 27, 2017, the court approved the dismissal.\n\nOn October 27, 2017, the Sheriff of East Baton Rouge Parish filed a motion to dismiss all claims against him for failure to state a claim, arguing that even if the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights were violated, the alleged policy of the sheriff was not the “moving force” behind the alleged violations. In February 2018, RHI and its executive director also filed a motion to dismiss with similar arguments.\n\nOn June 5, 2018, Judge Dick granted the Sheriff’s motion to dismiss, finding that there was no plausible basis to support the conclusory allegations that the Sheriff was “in agreement” or part of a “scheme” with RHI. 2018 WL 2708752. Judge Dick also dismissed RHI's motion to dismiss on September 12, 2018, claiming, among other things, that Defendants utterly failed to brief the elements of both the federal and state RICO claims and failed to argue how the Complaint fails to state a claim, and the facts asserted in the complaint plausibly plead that RHI was the moving force behind the alleged constitutional violation. 2018 WL 4355199\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on June 12, 2019. This complaint replaced an individual plaintiff with another individual plaintiff and removed the Sheriff of East Baton Rouge Parish as a defendant. \n\nOn July 2, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, claiming, among other things, that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \n\nThe parties reached a settlement agreement-in-principle and notified the court on Dec 5, 2019 that they are currently finalizing the final written settlement agreement to conclude this matter.

{"document": "On September 17, 2015, indigent former criminal defendants filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued the City of New Orleans, the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (OPCDC), the court’s judges, judicial administrators, and the city’s sheriff department, all under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Civil Rights Corps and private counsel, sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, claiming violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had a practice of imprisoning individuals who had failed to pay court debts without meaningfully determining whether the individuals had the ability to pay the debt. Moreover, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants issued unlawful warrants for their arrest and illegally kept them imprisoned. \n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss the sheriff from the lawsuit on October 3, 2015, and later on November, 2, 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss several of individual defendants from the lawsuit. The defendants argued three points: first, that there was a lack of jurisdiction to retain the defendants in this lawsuit, second, that the plaintiff did not join indispensable parties to the lawsuit, and third, that the judicial defendants enjoyed qualified immunity. On April 21, 2016, Judge Sarah Vance denied the defendants request to dismiss the defendants on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and failure to join indispensable parties. 186 F.Supp.3d 536.\n\nOn May 3, 2016, Judge Vance granted in part and denied in part the defendants' request to dismiss the judicial defendants on the grounds that they enjoyed absolute and qualified immunity. On May 11, 2016, the court dismissed the judicial administrator along with several other defendants from the lawsuit. However, the court still allowed the plaintiffs to seek declaratory relief. 184 F.Supp.3d 349. The parties began settlement negotiations.\n\nOn December 13, 2017, Judge Vance granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The Court found that (1) judges had a policy/practice of failing to conduct any inquiry into plaintiffs’ ability to pay court debts before plaintiffs are imprisoned for non-payment; (2) this failure to inquire violated due process; (3) judges’ control over both fines and fees revenue and ability-to-pay determinations violated due process; and (4) judges faced a substantial conflict of interest when they were determining the ability to pay fines and fees.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, the plaintiffs and the Orleans Parish Sheriff reached a compromise about two related civil actions, and so the court ordered partial dismissal without costs and without prejudice to the right to reopen those actions, retaining jurisdiction to enforce that settlement if it was not consummated within 60 days. \n\nOn August 2, 2018, Judge Vance granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification as all persons who owe or will incur court debts arising from cases adjudicated in OPCDC, with the subclass of all members whose debts are at least partly owed to the OPCDC Judicial Expense Fund. On August 3, 2018, the court filed a declaratory judgment, holding that the Judges’ policy or practice of not inquiring into the ability of the persons falling within the certified class to pay before they are imprisoned for non-payment of court debts was unconstitutional, and that the Judges’ failure to provide a neutral forum for determination of such persons’ ability to pay was also unconstitutional. The court invoked the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits a state actor from arresting or detaining a criminal defendant solely for failure to pay a court-imposed debt absent a determination of ability to pay, and which also requires a state court to provide a neutral forum in which to adjudicate ability to pay. 2018 WL 3657447.\n\nOn August 21, 2018, the defendants appealed to Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court on August 23, 2019. 937 F.3d 446.

The defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court on December 20, 2019. Cert was denied on March 3, 2020. \n\nMeanwhile, back in the district court, the plaintiffs moved the court for supplemental relief on February 25, 2019. The plaintiffs argued that a more specific declaratory judgment was appropriate and asked the court to decree it unconstitutional for any Orleans Parish Criminal District Court debtor to be imprisoned for willful nonpayment absent (1) a meaningful inquiry into the debtor’s ability to pay, preceded by notice of the importance of that issue and including an opportunity for the debtor to be heard on it, and (2) a finding that the debtor is able to pay. The defendants filed an opposition motion on March 19.

{"document": "On November 11, 2019, a pretrial detainee filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana alleging that twelve judges of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (\"OPCDC\") unlawfully imposed secured financial conditions of release in an amount that individuals cannot afford, without any inquiry into or findings concerning their ability to pay or alternatives to incarceration. The lawsuit was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201– 02 alleging violations of the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and seeking declaratory relief. The Plaintiff, represented by the MacArthur Justice Center and Civil Rights Corps, sued on behalf of a putative class consisting of all individuals with pending state misdemeanor or felony cases who would, after acceptance of their charges by the District Attorney, appear before the Defendant Judges for proceedings concerning pretrial release. \n\nThe complaint alleged that the Defendant judges’ imposition of bail without inquiring whether the arrestee could pay it constituted de facto orders of pretrial detention for those unable to pay. This constitutional violation was allegedly incentivized by the Defendants’ institutional financial conflict of interest. If (and only if) an arrestee uses a commercial surety to secure pretrial release, the OPCDC judges receive 0.8% of the amount of that bond that goes into a general fund used to pay a variety of expenses related to the judiciary. The Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on December 20 which added one more Plaintiff to represent the class.\n\nThe case was initially assigned to Judge Greg Gerard Guidry, but after he recused himself it was reassigned to Judge Carl Barbier.

The Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs’ claim was not redressible because the court cannot eliminate the Judges’ roles as both adjudicators of criminal matters and administrators of the general fund.

The defendants filed a second motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on March 31.\n\nA hearing was held on May 27, 2020 regarding Plaintiffs’ motion to certify the class and both of Defendants’ motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

On August 21, Judge Fallon denied the Plaintiffs' motion to certify, finding that there was not sufficient evidence to support the assertion that the Defendant-judges acted in a uniform manner. Judge Fallon noted that the Plaintiffs could seek certification again after engaging in discovery. In the same order, Judge Fallon also denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss as the Court declined to determine whether the Plaintiffs had standing before deciding the class certification question. 2020 WL 4923626.

{"document": "COVID Summary: This is a class action suit regarding the legality of detention orders that are holding detainees at East Baton Rouge Parish Prison for up to years and detrimental to life during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on December 14, 2020, but withdrew the request for a temporary restraining order in January 2021. A settlement conference is scheduled for March 11, and a joint status report is due on March 21. This case is ongoing. <hr>\n\nOn December 14, 2020, four individuals who were being held at East Baton Rouge Parish Prison (EBRPP) filed this class action lawsuit against 5 officials of the 19th Judicial District Courthouse, the sheriff, and the warden of EBRPP in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs sued for violations of their Fourteenth and Sixth Amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by the MacArthur Justice Center, Advancement Project, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, release of class members, and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick and Magistrate Judge Scott D. Johnson.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that hundreds of individuals, most of whom were poor and black, were confined at EBRPP for up to years as a result of the defendant judicial officials' actions. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants ignored the detainees' likelihood to appear at trial, risk of danger to the community, and ability to pay monetary conditions of release, which violated the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants ignored procedural protections, including failing to provide the detainees notice of hearing, opportunity to present evidence, and assistance to counsel prior to issuing pretrial detention orders, which violated due process. Additionally, they alleged that the defendants denied plaintiffs' counsel to make substantive arguments prior to issuing detention orders in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Lastly, the plaintiffs noted that EBRPP 's dilapidated conditions and history of poor medical care placed the detainees at an increased risk of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn December 14, 2020, the plaintiffs moved to proceed anonymously and for certification of the proposed class of \"all individuals who are in the custody of the East baton Rouge Sheriff's office after their arrest and who have been or will be subjected to the bail practices of the Judges and Commissioners of the 19th Judicial District Court.\" The following day, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the defendant sheriff and warden. The plaintiffs requested release of the named plaintiffs and for the court to enjoin the defendant sheriff and warden from detaining individuals whose bail conditions were determined at hearings that violated due process and equal protection. The plaintiffs filed declarations from *** pretrial detainees, some of whom have illnesses that make them vulnerable to COVID-19, have had arraignments delayed due to COVID-19, or cite inappropriate social distancing or hygiene practices.\n\nOn December 17, the plaintiffs moved for expedited discovery and on January 12, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an emergency second motion for expedited discovery and request for status conference. The court granted the motion in part and scheduled a status conference to discuss the plaintiffs' discovery request. At the January 14 conference, the court denied the plaintiff's first motion for expedited discovery as moot and granted in part the emergency second motion. The parties agreed to the scope of expedited discovery and set a discovery deadline of January 20, 2021. \n\nOn January 17, the plaintiffs moved to withdraw the request for temporary restraining order, which was granted on January 19. The plaintiffs then filed a joint motion to continue hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction, which was granted on January 21 and set a deadline of March 21 for the parties to file a joint status report. \n\nThe case remains ongoing with a settlement conference was scheduled for March 11, and with the defendants' responsive pleading to the complaint due on March 22, 2021.

{"document": "On January 19, 2006, a death-sentenced inmate of the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center in Baltimore, Maryland filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Maryland Department of Correction in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  The plaintiff, whose execution was scheduled to take place during the week of February 6, 2006, sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from carrying out his execution using their current practices and procedures for lethal injection.  The plaintiff's specific objection was to the three-drug cocktail (sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in Maryland's lethal injections.  He alleged that particular skill was required to properly administer sodium pentothal, which was intended to induce general anesthesia, and that improper administration of the drug would lead to excruciating, torturous pain during the administration of the other two drugs.  Due to this, the plaintiff argued that the defendants' lethal injection procedures arbitrarily and unnecessarily created a grave risk that he would suffer extreme pain during his execution, thus violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n\nThe next day, the plaintiff filed a similar complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, naming as co-plaintiffs the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Maryland (ACLU), and the Maryland Citizens Against State Executions (MCASE).  In this complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had failed to follow Maryland law (Md. Code Ann., State Gov't §3-905) in adopting their execution protocol because it had not been formally adopted under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA), thereby depriving the state's citizens of the opportunity to ensure that executions were carried out in a proper and humane manner and increasing the risk that the executed prisoners would suffer unnecessarily during their executions.  They asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and to enjoin the defendants from performing any executions until they had come into compliance with the law.  \n\nOn February 1, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Judge Benson Everett Legg) denied both the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order and his motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that Maryland's three-drug protocol did not endanger the plaintiff's constitutional rights.  The court reasoned that thirty-five of the thirty-seven states who used lethal injection as a means of execution used the same protocol as Maryland, and that the Fourth Circuit had already ruled that this protocol did not run afoul of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.  \n\nThe plaintiff appealed the following day, asking the District Court to stay the execution pending the outcome of the appeal.  On the same day, the District Court (Judge Legg) denied the request to stay the execution.  On February 3, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Judge James Harvie Wilkinson III) denied without opinion the plaintiff's motion for an injunction pending appeal.  \n\nOn February 13, the plaintiff asked the Fourth Circuit to dismiss the appeal, and on February 15, 2006, the Fourth Circuit (Judge Wilkinson) granted that motion.  \n\nFrom September 19-22, 2006, the U.S. District Court held an evidentiary hearing, and both sides filed motions for summary judgment.  On December 1, 2006, the District Court ordered the defendants to explore the potential availability of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and certified registered nurse anesthetists to assist in the execution.  On December 7, 2006, the Court ordered the defendants to submit a written plan describing the parameters of a proposed search.  \n\nMeanwhile, on December 19, 2006, the Maryland Court of Appeals invalidated the Maryland execution protocols until such time as they were properly adopted under the MAPA or exempted from that requirement by an act of the Maryland General Assembly.  The court enjoined the defendants from utilizing its current lethal injection protocol and checklist until one of these two events occurred.  Evans v. Saar, 396 Md. 256 (Md. Ct. App. 2006).\n\nOn January 29, 2007, Senate Bill 239 was introduced in the Maryland General Assembly and assigned to committee.  If adopted that bill would exempt the death penalty protocols from the requirements of the MAPA.  On the same day, House Bill 225 was introduced in the Maryland General Assembly and assigned to committee.  If adopted, that bill would repeal the death penalty in Maryland.  In light of these rapid changes, the parties issued a joint motion asking the District Court to stay the proceedings in this case until the passage of one of the two proposed bills in the legislature.  On February 21, 2007, the District Court agreed to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the legislation and ordered the parties to file a status report every 90 days.\n\nOn March 14, 2011, the parties filed a joint status report pursuant to the Court's order of February 22, 2007. The status report stated that all executions in Maryland had been stayed until the administrative regulations governing the death penalty process are properly adopted. On August 16, 2012 the Court ordered that the case be administratively closed.

{"document": "COVID-19 Summary: This is a case challenging the legality of the Small Business Administration's decision to exclude small business owners from parts of the CARES Act, passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 21, the court granted a preliminary injunction extending the deadline to apply for a loan for the named plaintiffs. <hr>\nIn response to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act, which created, among other things, the “Paycheck Protection Program.”  Under this program, small business owners could apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration; if they later certified that all of the loan funds had been used for qualifying expenses, the loan would be forgiven.  The Act authorized the SBA to use a streamlined rulemaking process, in order to distribute the $669 billion fund as quickly as possible.  The SBA’s Interim Final Rules rendered many small business owners with criminal records ineligible; the Interim Final Rules were changed several times between April and June 2020.\n\nOn June 16, 2020, three organizations and two individual plaintiffs filed this lawsuit challenging the legality of the SBA’s decision to exclude small business owners based on their criminal histories.  Represented by the ACLU, the Public Interest Law Center, the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and private counsel, they sued the Small Business Administration in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.  Their complaint alleged that the SBA had no statutory authority under the CARES Act to add the criminal record exclusions; that the exclusions were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; that the exclusions had a disparate impact on communities of color; and that the multiple changes to the Interim Final Rules had made it impossible for some qualifying small business owners to apply before the June 30 application deadline.  The case was assigned to Judge Catherine C. Blake.\n\nThe plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring unlawful and setting aside the SBA’s rulemaking action.  They also sought an injunction that would:<ol><li> bar the SBA from denying Paycheck Protection Program funds to applicants because of their criminal records,<li>compel the SBA to extend the application deadline three weeks (to July 21, 2020) in all of the states where the plaintiffs operated (Maryland, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, and Washington), and <li>reserve sufficient funds ($31,500) to fill the plaintiffs’ loan requests.</ol>They also sought attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\nThe SBA issued a new set of rules on June 24, which made all of the plaintiffs eligible to apply for loans.  However, in a June 29, 2020 ruling, the court declined to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims as moot.  The SBA had not demonstrated that the plaintiffs would not again be excluded from loan consideration; additionally, the SBA had not granted the requested deadline extension.  In that decision, the court found that the June 24 Interim Final Rule was a permissible interpretation of SBA’s statutory authority under the CARES Act.  The plaintiffs were thus unlikely to prevail on their claims that the June 24 Interim Final Rule was arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law.  The court found, however, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their arbitrary-and-capricious claims regarding the earlier incarnations of the Interim Final Rule; for that reason, the court granted a preliminary injunction ordering the deadline extended to July 21 for the named plaintiffs, but declined to issue any other requested relief.\n\nOn July 4, 2020, President Trump signed follow-up legislation that gave all business owners eligible under the June 24 Interim Final Rule until August 8, 2020 to apply.\n\nAs of July 29, 2020, further developments in the litigation are pending.", "summary": "In response to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act, which created, among other things, the “Paycheck Protection Program.”  Under this program, small business owners could apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration; if they later certified that all of the loan funds had been used for qualifying expenses, the loan would be forgiven.  \r\n\r\nThe SBA’s rules disqualified many small business owners with criminal records.

{"document": "On February 8, 2015, persons jailed for failing to pay fines imposed by the City of Ferguson that they could not afford filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. They made a number of allegations against Ferguson, including: (1) that the City failed to conduct an inquiry into whether plaintiffs were able to pay their fines before jailing them, in violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) that the City failed to provide plaintiffs with legal counsel during the proceedings leading to their incarceration, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments; (3) that the City jailed plaintiffs indefinitely and without an adequate legal process through which they could challenge their detention, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (4) that the squalid and unhealthy conditions of Ferguson's jail constituted Cruel and Unusual Punishment, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; (5) that the City used jail time and the threat of jail time to deny plaintiffs the substantive and procedural protections that Missouri debtors would have against private creditors, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (6) that the City issued arrest warrants against impoverished persons for failure to pay traffic fines without any finding of probable cause, in violation the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; and (7) that the City detained plaintiffs arrested without a valid warrant for an extended period without a legitimate government interest, in violation the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n \nRepresented by ArchCity Defenders, the Civil Rights Corps, Equal Justice Under Law, lawyers from St. Louis University School of Law, and private counsel including White & Case LLP, the plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201. They sought class action certification, declaratory relief, injunctive relief requiring Ferguson to change its practices and policies to stop violating the U.S. Constitution, damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Audrey G. Fleissig.\n\nOn May 26, 2015, the court granted defendant's motion to dismiss in part, dismissing plaintiffs’ claims (5) and (6). 2015 WL 3417420. However, on July 13, 2015, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, reversing the May 26 order. 2015 WL 4232917.\n\nOn January 29, 2016, the parties were told to select neutral parties to act as mediators and to schedule mediation to see if they could come to a settlement agreement. On May 10, 2016, the neutral parties reported that though they had mediated in good faith, they were unable to reach a settlement. \n\nOn April 13, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint. The defendant subsequently filed a partial motion to dismiss two weeks later in response. The plaintiffs in July filed a motion with the court to compel production of emails from the defendant in support of its claim that the City of Ferguson engaged in a \"widespread scheme\" of jailing individuals who could not afford small debts. While the motion to dismiss the amended complaint was denied in November, the court subsequently granted the defendant's claim of privilege on the documents and held a hearing on that issue. The motion to compel documents was eventually granted in part and denied in part to the extent that plaintiffs sufficiently narrowed search terms for the electronic documents. The case proceeded through discovery in 2017.\n\nPlaintiffs sought class certification again in June 2017 and simultaneously moved to disqualify defendant's counsel due to a conflict of interest. In August, the court granted the motion to disqualify counsel and extended a stay on the issue of class certification. According to <a href=https://www.propublica.org/article/a-lawsuit-over-ferguson-debtors-prison-drags-on>ProPublica</a>, the firm was disqualified because it had hired a lawyer who had previously represented one of the plaintiffs while working for ArchCity Defenders. The court denied class certification on January 29, 2018 without prejudice to refiling.\n\nOnce the defendant obtained replacement counsel in September, it moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on Counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 due to sovereign immunity. This further stayed proceedings until resolution on the issue on February 13, 2018, when the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. 2018 WL 10245936. On February 15, the defendant filed an interlocutory appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals of the decision against sovereign immunity.\n\nSubsequently, the defendant moved to stay proceedings pending appeal. The plaintiffs had opposed the motion to stay, claiming that there was no ruling for the defendant to appeal. The original trial date in April was vacated. On March 12, 2018, the court granted the stay. The case was administratively closed until resolution of the interlocutory appeal. On January 10, 2019, the Eighth Circuit (Judges Steven Colloton, Raymond Gruender, and L. Steven Grasz) dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court explained that the City was not itself entitled to sovereign immunity and could not invoke the state's sovereign immunity to justify dismissing the suit. 913 F.3d 757. The district court lifted the stay and litigation resumed. \n\nThe defendant filed a motion to dismiss counts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 on March 5, 2020. After briefing, the court denied this motion in full on August 6, 2019. The court found that, contrary to the defendant's arguments, the state municipal court was not a required party whose absence (here due to sovereign immunity) required dismissal. 2019 WL 3577529. Later that month, on August 28, the defendant appealed this order to the Eighth Circuit. The defendant filed a motion to stay proceedings pending appeal the following day. The district court denied this motion on September 19, 2019, and discovery continued.

{"document": "On May 27, 2015, this lawsuit was brought in the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri by a person arrested by the City of St. Ann (the City), Missouri, who was jailed for a prolonged period after he was unable to pay the fee demanded for his release under the city’s “secured bail” policy. Under that policy, persons arrested for ordinance violations were required to post a bail from $150-350 or spend upwards of 3 days in jail, without any consideration of the person’s ability to pay. The plaintiff argued that the City’s policy violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Represented by public interest organizations ArchCity Defenders and Equal Justice Under Law, the plaintiff brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff asked the court for class certification to represent other similarly situated individuals, for a declaration that the City had violated the constitutional rights of arrestees who were unable to pay the City’s secured bail, for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the City to stop jailing arrestees for their inability to pay the City’s secured bail, for damages to the named plaintiff to compensate for his period of confinement, and for legal costs and attorneys’ fees. \n\nThat same day, plaintiffs moved for class certification for the proposed class: \"all arrestees unable to pay for their release pursuant to St. Ann's fixed bail schedule who are or will become in the custody of St. Ann.\"\n\nThe next day, the parties asked the judge assigned to the case, Judge Rodney W. Sippel, to grant them a stay in proceedings so that they could conduct settlement negotiations. To that end, plaintiffs dropped their request for preliminary injunctive relief pending the outcome of the negotiations. The day after that, on May 29, 2015, Judge Sippel granted a stay, and asked the parties to report the outcome of the negotiations to him by August 3, 2015. \n\nOn September 2, 2015, Judge Sippel asked the parties, who had failed to meet his August 3 deadline, to show cause for why he shouldn’t dismissed the case with prejudice or issue sanctions. That same day, the parties issued a joint motion showing the judge their provisional settlement agreement, and explaining that they wanted to see how the changes that the agreement required in the City’s policies worked over the coming year. The next day, Judge Sippel agreed to give the parties twelve months to test the effects of the policy changes, and ordered the defendants to comply with the provisional settlement agreement during that period.\n\nUnder the provisional settlement agreement, the plaintiffs agreed to drop most of their non-equitable claims (the claims for monetary damages). The defendants agreed to meet most of plaintiff’s demands for injunctive relief, and to give the named plaintiff a $10,000 fee for acting as a class representative. Namely, the defedants agreed to stop requiring arrestees to post a secured bail for release. Instead, they agreed to release arrestees if they agreed to provide an unsecured bond (a bond which requires persons to pay the court only if they fail to adhere to the conditions of their bail) or a recognizance (an alternative set of conditions for preventing persons from violating the terms of their bail to the payment of a monetary fee), except for cases in which the arrestee was a threat and detention was required to protect the community. The defendants also agreed to improve their procedures for notifying arrestees of their court dates, and to release persons arrested for failure to attend court dates on unsecured bonds. \n\nThe parties agreed that the plaintiff and their counsel would notify defendants of any perceived breach in the agreement, and that the plaintiff and their counsel reserved the right to pursue judgment against defendants if they failed to remedy the breach. The parties also reserved the right to seek modification of the agreement, and if they fail to reach an agreement on modification, to terminate the agreement and resume litigation. \n\nOn June 5, 2017, Judge Sippel ordered the parties to show cause for why their respective cases should not be dismissed. He noted that both parties had failed to file official settlement documents by the required date he had set. Both parties responded, and a status conference was set. \n\nA consent judgment was filed by the defendant and signed on May 4, 2018 by Judge Sippel. In the consent judgement, the defendant specifically agreed to (1) not utilize secured money bail for persons in the custody of the Defendant on arrest; (2) offer any arrested person release from the custody of the Defendant on recognizance or on an unsecured bond as soon as practicable after booking (with the only exception are persons charged with assault, or if release would pose a danger to the community); (3) notify all arrestees in writing upon release from custody when and where they are required to appear in court; (4) specific procedures in relation to traffic stops; (5) mail a notice of a motion for bond forfeiture, should the released person fail to appear in court; and (6) to take appropriate and lawful steps to convert any unsecured bond into a money judgment at any time after non-appearance. \n\nThe court retained jurisdiction over the consent judgement for two years starting on May 4, 2018. Subsequent to the dissolution of the consent judgment, the defendant agreed to continue to (1) ensure that indigent persons arrested were afforded the necessary protections under the law; and (2) comply with applicable state and federal laws pertaining to the setting of conditions upon pre-trail release from custody. \n\nAs of May 20, 2020, there has been no further action in the docket and the case is presumed to be closed.

Specifically, they claimed that the municipalities imprisoned people for a failure to pay debts owed for minor offenses without inquiring as to their ability to pay in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; failed to provide adequate legal counsel at hearings in which indigent people were imprisoned in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments; incarcerated people indefinitely and without adequate procedural protections in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; sought, issued, and served warrants without probable cause in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; and imposed unduly restrictive methods of debt collection, through incarceration and the threat of incarceration, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 30, 2016. On December 2, 2016, in response to the amended complaint, the court (Judge Rodney W. Sippel) denied the motion to dismiss filed by the defendants.\n\nThe defendants again moved to dismiss on December 14, 2016. On April 24, 2017, Judge Sippel dismissed the claims against all defendant municipalities except the City of St. Ann, finding that the amended complaint failed to state a claim for conspiracy. Judge Sippel ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint against the City of St. Ann and to limit their claims to actions taken by St. Ann. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the conspiracy claim and the dismissal of all other defendants aside from St. Ann, which Judge Sippel denied on July 5, 2017.\n\nOn July 21, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint limited to the actions and policies of the City of St. Ann. On September 8, 2017, the City filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's § 1983 claims for lack of jurisdiction, claiming that the real defendant in interest in the matter was the St. Ann municipal division of the Missouri State Circuit Court, an arm-of-the-state entitled to sovereign immunity. The same day, the City filed a motion to dismiss the remaining count alleging Fourteenth Amendment violations for failure to state a claim. The court denied the defendants' motion on September 14, 2018. \n\nThe court issued an order on October 4, 2018 severing the plaintiff's count relating to conditions of the City of St. Ann's jail. It was then placed on the court's docket as a separate action, and discovery proceeded for the remaining claims. \n\nOn March 16, 2019, defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings for failure to join an indispensable party. Before oral argument on that motion, however, Judge Sippel referred the case to mediation. The parties filed a joint motion to vacate the mediation order on June 19, 2019, but Judge Sippel denied this motion the following day. In a memorandum and order issued on September 3, 2019, the court denied the defendants' motion. 2019 WL 4169215. \n\nAs of April 18, 2020, the mediation deadlines have been extended several times and are currently set to terminate on June 30, 2020.

{"document": "On June 14, 2017, a man awaiting criminal trial and Lexington National Insurance Corporation, a bail bond company, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The case was assigned to Judge Jerome Simandle. The plaintiffs sued the state of New Jersey under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that a New Jersey state law, the Criminal Justice Reform Act (CJRA), violated the bail provision of the Eighth Amendment, due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The CJRA required that pretrial release by monetary bail occur only if a criminal court court found that non-monetary conditions were inadequate. The plaintiffs sought damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief.\n\nOn the same day that the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would enjoin the provisions of the CJRA that they deemed unconstitutional.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, the state filed a brief in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction and moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. The same day, the American Civil Liberties Union, American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, Drug Policy Alliance, Latino Action Network, and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People – New Jersey State Conference jointly moved to participate as amici curiae in support of the defendant. All of these civil rights organizations would be represented by one ACLU lawyer. These prospective amici also filed a brief in opposition to the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nOn September 21, 2017, the court denied the the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. The court held that the plaintiffs’ case was unlikely to succeed on the merits and that the plaintiffs were unlikely to suffer irreparable harm without an injunction. Judge Simandle also stated that the accused plaintiff was a bad class representative for a potential class action because the crime that he was on pretrial release for was particularly violent. 277 F. Supp. 3d 707. (Though the plaintiffs had not yet moved for class certification, their complaint indicated that they intended to seek it.)\n\nFour days later, on September 25, 2017, the plaintiffs appealed the court’s decision regarding the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. (Docket Number: 17-03104). In the meantime, the plaintiffs sought to pause litigation in the District Court pending a decision in the Appellate Court. The defendant protested; the Appellate Court’s decision would not affect the District Court’s decision on the merits of the case, so the state wanted to move forward. Still, the District Court granted the stay, holding that the litigation would not continue in the District Court until the Third Circuit had decided the appeal. The District Court therefore terminated the defendant’s motion to dismiss, holding it in abeyance until after the Court of Appeals rendered its decision.\n\nThe Third Circuit heard oral arguments on this case on February 21, 2018. The panel was made up of Judge Thomas L. Ambro, Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo, and Judge Julio M. Fuentes. In an opinion issued on July 9, 2018, they affirmed the district court's denial of preliminary injunction. The opinion held that there is no \"federal constitutional right to deposit money or obtain a corporate surety bond to ensure a criminal defendant's future appearance in court as an equal alternative to non-monetary conditions of pretrial release.\" 895 F.3d 272. \n\nThe plaintiff petitioned for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court on October 1, 2018. His petition was denied on October 29. 139 S.Ct. 440. The plaintiff subsequently dismissed the suit voluntarily, and the case was terminated on October 31, 2018.

{"document": "On May 11, 2011, three individuals given extra-judicial sentences of post-release supervision filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The named defendants were the New York State Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) and the New York State Division of Parole (DOP). They claimed that the defendants administratively assigned sentences of post-release supervision (PRS) and that only a judge could impose an additional sentence under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, class certification, and compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 20, 2011, which added two named plaintiffs to the action, bringing the total to three.\n\nOn November 15, 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on the ground of qualified immunity. On February 10, 2012, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin denied the motion. <i>Bentley v. Dennison</i>, 852 F. Supp. 2d 379 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). The court found that the plaintiffs had made plausible factual allegations that the defendants were responsible for the deprivation of their constitutional rights and that the plaintiffs' rights were clearly established under <i>Earley v. Murray</i>, 451 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2006). The defendants appealed from the denial of their motion to dismiss, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's holding on July 8, 2014. The appeals court held that, under <i>Earley</i>, the administrative imposition PRS terms not imposed by the court was unconstitutional, thus precluding a finding of qualified immunity in this case.  \n\nOn July 16, 2014, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge James C. Francis for settlement purposes. \n\nOn January 28, 2015, Judge Scheindlin granted the plaintiffs' Motion to Certify Class. The court found that the plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of class certification. The class consisted of “all persons who were sentenced to prison in New York State for a fixed term that did not include a term of PRS, but who were nevertheless subjected to PRS after the maximum expiration dates of their determinate sentences and after June 9, 2006.”\n\nOn May 8, 2015, the defendants requested summary judgment. They argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity and that the plaintiffs had failed to establish the personal involvement of certain defendants. The defendants also moved to modify the class to exclude certain class members’ claims that they alleged were barred by statute of limitations, and to exclude class members whose claims they alleged were precluded. Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the question of personal liability for three officers. \n\nOn August 6, 2015, Judge Scheindlin granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion for summary judgment and granted the plaintiffs' partial motion for summary judgment. The court found that since the defendants had failed to make reasonable efforts to comply with precedent that the imposition of post-release supervisory sentences was unconstitutional, they were not entitled to qualified immunity. The court further found that the three individual defendants cited in the plaintiffs' motion could be held personally liable as a matter of law, while the court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the remaining DOP defendants. Regarding the defendants' remaining claims, the court held that the action was not barred by the statute of limitations or collateral estoppel. \n\nThe defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on qualified immunity grounds. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for an order certifying defendants' interlocutory appeal as frivolous. On October 14, 2015, the District Court found that dual jurisdiction was warranted between the District Court and the Court of Appeals because the defendants' renewed qualified immunity claims were frivolous. Thus, the District Court determined that it retained jurisdiction despite the interlocutory appeal.\n\nHowever, on December 16, 2015, the Court of Appeals ordered a stay of proceedings in the District Court pending resolution of the defendants' interlocutory appeal. On September 16, 2016, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of qualified immunity to the defendants. <i>Betances v. Fisher</i>, 837 F.3d 162 (2d Cir. 2016). During this period of time, the case was reassigned to District Judge Deborah A. Batts. \n\nOn May, 30 2018, the parties consented for the rest of the case to be heard by a magistrate judge. The case was then assigned to United States Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger.\n\nFollowing several years of additional discovery and intermittent attempts at settlement discussions, in August 2018 the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and to modify or decertify the class. Specifically, the defendants sought to: (1) dismiss class members whose claims were untimely; (2) dismiss class members who had claims for compensatory damages and award them nominal damages; (3) if the court deemed any class members' damages could be more than nominal, dismiss claims for damages not caused by the defendants; (4) modify the class to exclude plaintiffs if they were referred for resentencings, or limit their damages; (5) decertify the class for purposes of damages; and (6) preclude claims for false imprisonment. \n\nJudge Lehrburger decided the defendants' motions for summary judgment and class certification on February 21, 2019. He denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment, except to the extent that it applied to plaintiffs who had sentences of PRS imposed to fix clerical errors by their sentencing courts. Judge Lehrburger barred these plaintiffs from receiving more than nominal damages. He also completely denied the class decertification motion. \n\nAfter the defendants' motions were denied, the case slowly crept towards trial, which was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 1, 2021, Judge Lehrburger set a trial date of June 16, 2021.\n\nAs of April 12, 2021, the case remains pending.", "summary": "Persons in the custody of the New York State Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) brought this class action against DOCS and the New York State Division of Parole (DOP) for the extra-judicial imposition of sentences requiring post-release supervision.

The defendants' motion for summary judgment was granted with respect to several defendants, but denied on the issue of qualified immunity; and plaintiffs' cross motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability for three officers was granted. The defendants appealed the qualified immunity decision, but the Second Circuit affirmed. On remand, the defendants moved for summary judgment again, but that motion was denied. The case is currently scheduled for trial in Summer 2021."}
{"document": "Individuals incarcerated in the Tulsa jail sued Tulsa County, the Tulsa County Sheriff, fifteen Special Judges and a district court judge in challenging the constitutionality of the county's wealth-based pretrial detention system. On June 6, 2018, the four plaintiffs, represented by Civil Rights Corps, filed this class-action lawsuit in the Northern District of Oklahoma. The case was assigned to Judge Claire Eagan. The plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Declaratory Judgement Act, alleging that defendants violated their Equal Protection, Due Process, and Sixth Amendment rights by depriving them of their fundamental right to pretrial liberty and failing to provide counsel at bail hearings. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief preventing the defendants from assigning bail without inquiring as to whether criminal defendants can pay it. The plaintiffs also asked the court to permanently enjoin the defendants from denying the putative class-members the right to a speedy, individualized hearing with counsel. \n\nThe plaintiffs were each arrested and informed that they had to pay bail ranging from $500 to $50,000 in order to be released from jail before their hearing. They were not asked whether they could afford the bond; because none of them had the financial resources to post bail, they were held for up to 11 days before their hearing without access to legal counsel. The plaintiffs alleged that this \"wealth-based detention scheme\" jailed presumptively innocent people for at least a week before they are able to challenge their detention. Such a system, the plaintiffs contend, violates the the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n\nThe same day that the complaint was filed, the plaintiffs asked for the court to certify their class. The plaintiffs proposed class consisted of \"all people who are or will be detained in the Tulsa County Jail because they are unable to pay a secured financial condition of release.\"\n\nThe Tulsa County Sheriff answered the complaint on August 3, 2018, and the defendant-judges moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The defendant-judges argued that the plaintiffs failed to use available state court remedies, such as criminal appellate or habeas processes, that could provide relief. Additionally, the defendant-judges also argued that the plaintiffs failed to allege specific misconduct beyond the judges' lack of addressing bail at arraignments.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 22, 2018. However, on November 19, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' amended complaint, the plaintiffs' motion for class-certification, and the defendant-judges' motion to dismiss as moot. 2018 WL 6048016. The court found that the plaintiffs paid their bonds and were released from jail in the days following the original complaint and therefore no longer suffered an actual injury. The court also determined that the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" exception did not apply because these four plaintiffs were expected to comply with the law and therefore this injury was not expected to repeat with regards to these plaintiffs. Additionally, the Court found that the claims were not \"inherently transitory.\"\n\nOn December 11, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider the court's judgment. The plaintiffs objected to the court's characterization of their claims. The plaintiffs argued that they did not challenge their pretrial detention per se, but rather challenged their pretrial detention without counsel and a hearing. The plaintiffs argued that this characterization fit the \"inherently transitory\" exception to mootness because the Court could not reasonably consider a class certification motion before any named plaintiffs’ individual claims became moot.\n\nJudge Eagan agreed with the plaintiffs and, on March 15, 2019, granted their motion for reconsideration. 2019 WL 1231675. The court reinstated the plaintiff's amended complaint and motion for class certification, and also reinstated the defendant-judges' motion to dismiss.\n\nWith the case active again, the defendant-judges filed their answer on March 25, 2019, and responded in opposition the plaintiffs' motion for class certification on April 15. The defendants also moved to stay the proceedings until the Oklahoma Senate considered a bill that would require individualized considerations of the ability to pay bail. On May 9, Judge Eagan granted the motion until the end of the legislative session or until the bill was signed into law. On June 14, the stay was lifted as the legislative session had ended.\n\nThe defendant-judges again moved to dismiss the claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on December 10. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing, since their pre-trial detention had ended and therefore they were no longer suffering an injury.\n\nAfter engaging in settlement talks but failing to reach an agreement, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. They contended that the COVID-19 pandemic altered the conditions of detention such that injunctive relief was required in order to prevent irreparable harm to people detained solely based on their inability to pay bail. Judge Eagan denied the plaintiffs' motion on May 11, finding that the preliminary relief was inappropriate given the lack of COVID cases in Tulsa County jails at that time and because a preliminary injunction would not solve the bail issue raised before the pandemic began. 2020 WL 2393855. \n\nAs of January 13, 2021, the case remains ongoing.

{"document": "This federal civil rights case successfully challenged a Davidson county Tennessee rule requiring garnishment of bail bonds, as applied to a non-profit bail bond service. \n\nDavidson County, TN, has a local rule that allows the County Criminal Court to garnish bond deposits made by criminal defendants to pay prior judgment fees--including fines, court costs, and restitution. If incarcerated people do not agree to potential garnishment, they are not allowed to post bond. In practice, the Nashville Community Bail Fund (NCBF), a non-profit that provides bail bonds to indigent arrestees, was exempted from this rule for years. But in September 2019, the County Criminal Court judges revoked the exemption. \n\nOn February 5, 2020, the NCBF filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee (in Nashville). The plaintiff sued the Davidson County Criminal Court Clerk under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by the ACLU, Civil Rights Corps, and a Nashville-based non-profit law firm Choosing Justice Initiative, the plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief. NCBF claimed that the revocation of its longstanding exemption violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on excessive bail as well as the Fourteenth Amendment doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to due process. \n\nOn March 17, 2020 District Judge Aleta Trauger granted NCBF’s motion for a preliminary injunction. This injunction prohibited the County Criminal Court Clerk from requiring NCBF to agree to the garnishment rule for bonds that it sought to post. 446 F. Supp. 3d 282.

{"document": "On May 3, 2016, two indigent citizens who were jailed for not paying traffic and misdemeanor fines, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued the City of El Paso under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Texas Constitution. Represented by lawyers from the Texas Civil Rights Project, the plaintiffs alleged that the City violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as their rights under the Texas Constitution. The plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to enjoin the defendants from enforcing their current debt collection program.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the City adopted a 25-percent plan in 2006 that required those assessed fines, including fines from Class C Misdemeanors and traffic tickets, to either pay 25 percent of their fines or go to jail. The plan did not account for people unable to pay 25 percent of their fines. The repayment plan, alleged the plaintiffs, was adopted as a method of revenue generation for the city. The plaintiffs asserted in their complaint that the City made $19 million from such fines in 2015 and that the policy was pursued purposely, by training municipal court clerks to tell debtors that their only options were the 25-percent payment or jail. The plaintiffs were never informed of their right to assert indigence, and they alleged that the City became aware of issues with its debt collection process but failed to reform the system.\n\nOn January 12, 2017, Judge David Guaderrama issued an order denying in part and granting in part the City's motion to dismiss, which was filed on June 6, 2016. Judge Guaderrama only looked at the due process claims because the City failed to address the equal protection claims. The plaintiffs' main due process claim was that the City's clerks failed to inform indigent debtors of their right to assert indigence. The court dismissed this claim. Judge Guaderrama held that the city had no constitutional duty to inform the plaintiffs of their right to assert their indigence. Judge Guaderrama only addressed the § 1983 action concerning the violation of the plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. He allowed the equal protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment and Texas Constitution to stand because the City had failed to address them in their motion to dismiss. \n\nOn January 20, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and on February 3, 2017, the City responded with a new motion to dismiss, which the Court denied on April 25, 2017. One month later, the Court scheduled a jury trial to take place in March of 2018. After some months of discovery disputes and negotiation between the parties, the defendants again moved to dismiss the case, but the Court rejected the motion as untimely on December 11, 2017. \n\nThe parties continued negotiating and ultimately did reach a settlement agreement, which led the parties to file for a stipulated dismissal on May 23, 2018. That same week, on May 29, 2018, the Court reviewed the stipulated dismissal and entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice. This case is now closed, but the parties may litigate noncompliance with the contractual terms of the settlement agreement. \n\nThe settlement agreement included the following: a full release of any and all claims by both sides; an agreement that each side would bear its own costs; and an agreement that the City would, for three years following the settlement, continue certain administrative practices. These administrative practices related to: (a) notices to defendants of policies and procedures; (b) forms and procedures associated with payment plans, including a policy that payment plans required no money down, and that defendants could request an extension at any time; (c) notices to defendants regarding court hearings and court schedules; (d) policies and procedures related to indigency hearings and the issuance of warrants; and (e) a promise by defendants not to create any notice, form, procedure or policy that is inconsistent with the notices, forms, policies, and procedures that were attached to the settlement agreement. \n", "summary": "In May of 2016 two indigent people brought a suit against the City of El Paso in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for jailing them for failure to pay fines, despite their inability to do so. The plaintiffs brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983, and allege that the Defendants violated their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief. They want to enjoin the Defendants from enforcing their current debt collection program, which jails people who can't pay a certain portion of their fines for traffic and misdemeanor offenses. The Plaintiffs allege that Defendants adopted their debt collection program to generate revenue for they city, and the individual plaintiffs were not informed that they could assert their indigence. Rather, the Plaintiffs were simply told they had to pay or go to jail. On January 12th, 2017 Judge David Guaderrama granted the Defendant's motion to dismiss in part. Judge Guaderrama dismissed the Due Process claims, but did not reach the Equal Protection claims.\r\n\r\nThe Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in January 2017, and after the Court denied two motions to dismiss filed by defendants over the course of 2017, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the action pursuant to a settlement agreement. In the settlement agreement, defendants agreed to maintain certain administrative practices for three years. Among other things, these practices related to notice to defendants, policies and procedures for: payment plans; notice to defendants of court hearings and schedules; and indigency hearings and warrants issued for non-payment.

{"document": "On January 14, 2016, two indigent women that previously served imprisonment terms at the Randall County Jail filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiff sued the city of Amarillo under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought compensatory damages, claiming the City of Amarillo violated their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection Rights. The plaintiffs claimed that the City of Amarillo installed its own debtor’s prison through its municipal code that required residents that owed fees and fines to “Pay or lay.” Although the city provided an installment plan in order to make payments, once an individual missed a payment, a warrant for his or her arrest would be immediately issued. Hearings to determine a person’s indigency or alternate methods of enforcement are not required by the municipal code. The plaintiffs were both single mothers with part-time jobs as their only source of income. Both struggled to secure consistent employment. One plaintiff had an income of $40.00 a month and the court ordered a payment plan that required her to pay $232.00 in biweekly payments until her debt was paid. When the plaintiff informed the court she would be unable to meet this plan and request modification, she was immediately denied modification and sent to jail for eighteen days. The other plaintiff was unaware that she could assert indigency or request a payment plan, she believed her only option was to “pay or lay.” The plaintiff did not have the money to pay all of her fines and served eighteen days in jail.  The plaintiffs sought class certification on behalf of all indigent persons adjudicated by the City of Amarillo Municipal Court that owed fines or court costs and ordered to serve imprisonment terms for failure to pay the adjudicated fines and costs. \n\nThe defendant responded to the complaint with a motion to dismiss on February 11, 2016. The defense argued that a city could not be liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for an alleged policy of wrongfully jailing persons because the decisions are solely made by the municipal judges who are acting in their judicial capacity and the city of Amarillo have no control or influence. The defendant further argued that the complaint failed to allege an official policy promoted by a municipal policymaker that was the moving force behind the constitutional violation claims. The Court did not immediately address the defendant’s motion, instead, it permitted the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on March 2, 2016. In the amended complaint the plaintiffs addressed the concerns provided by the defendant in its earlier motion to dismiss and expanded its Fourteenth Amendment violation claim to include court administrators and the police department. The plaintiffs alleged that the police department had a policy and practice of jailing indigent people without inquiring as to their reasons for nonpayment, determining whether they were indigent, or considering adequate alternatives to incarceration.\n\nOn March 16, 2016, the City of Amarillo filed another motion to dismiss on similar grounds of its previous motion to dismiss and that the plaintiffs’ new claims were conclusive and not supported by any factual underpinnings. Once again, the Court did not immediately address the defendant’s motion to dismiss and permitted the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. \n\nThe discovery period began and plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on April 4, 2016. The new complaint addressed the defendant’s previous issues and added four new plaintiffs that also served imprisonment terms as punishment for their inability to pay ticket fines and court fees.  On April 13, 2016,  the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify class on behalf of all indigent persons adjudicated by the City of Amarillo Municipal Court that owed fines or court costs and ordered to serve imprisonment terms for failure to pay the adjudicated fines and costs. The defendant filed several briefs in response to the plaintiffs motion and discovery continued.\n\nOn August 8, 2016, Senior Judge Mary Lou Robinson entered an opinion and order granting the defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as to all of the plaintiffs’ 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims. The Court also denied the plaintiffs’ motion to certify class as moot due to the previous order to dismiss the case. Judge Robinson entered her final judgment in favor of the defendant and declared that the defendant was entitled to reasonable and necessary costs as a result of the action. \n\nThe plaintiffs objected to the defendant’s bill of costs on August 30, 2016. On October 12, 2016, Judge Robinson partially sustained the plaintiffs’ objections and ordered for the plaintiffs’ to pay $3,660.00 to the defendant in costs. \n\nThere are no further entries on this docket, inferring that this case is closed. \n", "summary": "In January 2016, two indigent women that served imprisonment terms at the Randall County Jail filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.

{"document": "The advocacy organization Children's Rights, Inc. filed this lawsuit in June 2002 against the state of Georgia and the Departments of Family and Children Services (DFCS) in Fulton and DeKalb Counties, on behalf of children in foster care in Fulton and DeKalb counties. Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Georgia State Constitution, the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Medicaid Act, and the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994. The complaint alleged that children did not receive necessary treatment and services while spending months in emergency shelters, experienced abuse and neglect as a result of an insufficient number of caseworkers, and received inadequate health care and emotional services while in foster care. Plaintiffs originally brought suit in Georgia state courts, but the stated removed the case to federal court because the cause of action included federal laws.\n\nJudge Marvin Shoob of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification in August 2003, and at the same time granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in part regarding certain claims about the operation of emergency shelters, because the shelters had been closed. The Court denied a later motion for summary judgment filed by the counties and found that children in foster care in Georgia have a state statutory and constitutional right to effective counsel in child abuse and neglect proceedings. Kenny A. v. Perdue, 356 F. Supp. 2d 1353 (N.D. Ga. 2005).\n\nIn July 2005, Georgia agreed to a settlement that limited the caseload of case workers and required the state to meet benchmarks in numerous areas of service to children, including medical, dental, and mental health screenings and treatment. The court assigned two independent monitors to report on Georgia's progress towards meeting the benchmarks. \n\nThe county defendants entered into a consent decree with plaintiffs in May 2006; it approved the right-to-counsel settlements and established independent monitors for each county until the counties remain in substantial compliance for a continuous eighteen month period. The consent decrees established staffing requirements and caseloads for child advocate attorneys, and other bureaucratic changes to how Fulton County manages its County Child Advocate Attorneys office. DeKalb County and Fulton County were released from federal oversight in October 2008 and April 2011, respectively, because they had improved the quality of representation provided to foster children.\n\nIn August 2008, the plaintiffs filed a contempt motion against the state, citing its failure to meet court-ordered requirements to place hundreds of children in permanent homes. The state and plaintiffs jointly filed an agreement to consult national welfare experts in order to review the cases of all children in the backlog and to place them in permanent homes. The court Monitor has made six-month reports on the Georgia's progress towards meeting benchmarks.\n\nOn November 2, 2015, the parties agreed to a joint stipulation and order to modify the consent decree.  The original consent decree required two independent accountability agents, but the parties agree to reduce that to one agent. \n\nOn February 16, 2016, the independent monitor team submitted a report finding the State was still not compliant with the court-ordered benchmarks.  On February 24, 2016, the case was transferred from Judge Shoob, who had had it since its inception in 2002, to Judge Thomas W. Thrash, Jr. \n\nOn December 5, 2016, the court granted a joint motion to modify the consent decree, adding additional clarifications and stipulations regarding placements, visitation, outcome measures, process and infrastructure requirements, terms upon which State Defendants may move for the termination of the consent decree, and dispute resolution provisions. The modified consent decree also provided for biannual reports from the Monitoring and Technical Assistance Team on the ongoing and attained outcomes. \n\nThe civil case was closed on August 17, 2017, but biannual monitoring reports continue to be filed. As of June 2018, the monitoring report noted that the Dekalb and Fulton County directors were prioritizing increasing the staff size and quality of training while emphasizing keeping families together and reducing the foster population. However, the report also found that there were inconsistencies in the data relating to caseload, vacancies, new hires and turnover. \n\nAs of April 2020, the biannual monitoring reports continue to be filed. The January 2020 report shows that the counties have continued to increase their efforts to initially search for and place children with relatives, visitation has improved in all areas, and the state met the threshold for timelines to adoption and guardianship after parental rights have been terminated or released. However, the region continues to struggle with children and teenagers re-entering care and with meeting educational and mental health needs of children in care. \n\n<i>Attorneys fees</i>\n\nIn addition to the litigation regarding enforcement of the consent decree, this case also included extensive litigation regarding the award of attorney's fees to the plaintiffs.  The consent decree with the State did not resolve the issue of attorney's fees and the parties had left that to the court to decide. The plaintiffs submitted a request for more than $14 million in attorney's fees. Half of that amount was based on their calculation of the lodestar (the number of hours spent working on the case multiplied by the attorneys' hourly rate). The other half was a fee enhancement for superior work and results.  The defendants  objected to the fee request, contending that some of the proposed hourly rates were too high, that the hours claimed were excessive, and that the enhancement would duplicate factors that were reflected in the lodestar amount.\n\nOn October 3, 2006, the district court awarded fees of approximately $10.5 million. 454 F.Supp.2d 1260 (N.D.Ga.2006). The court determined that the lodestar was $6 million and then enhanced that amount by 75% to account for superior performance and results.   The defendants appealed this determination to the Eleventh Circuit. \n\nAfter oral argument, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's award because it was not an abuse of discretion to award that amount of attorney's fees on July 3, 2008.  532 F.3d 1209 (2008).  The eleventh circuit judges were divided over the district court's enhancement. The Eleventh Circuit denied the defendants' request for a rehearing en banc but was also divided over this ruling. The defendants petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari seeking review solely as to the $4.5 million enhancement, which the Supreme Court granted.  The Supreme Court heard oral argument on October 14, 2009.\n\nThen, on April 21, 2010, the Supreme Court reversed the award of attorney's fees and remanded the case for further proceedings.  The Supreme Court reaffirmed the rule that enhancements are permitted in extraordinary circumstances, but held that the district court had not provided proper justification for the enhancement it awarded in this case. The Supreme Court outlined standards for enhancements: 1) there is a strong presumption that the lodestar is sufficient; 2) factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot be used as a ground for increasing an award above the lodestar; and 3) a party seeking fees has the burden of identifying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take into account and proving with specificity that an enhanced fee is justified. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded because the District Court had not applied these standards.  559 U.S. 542 (2010).\n\nAccordingly, on September 2, 2010, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court's order and judgment entered on October 3, 2006, awarding the plaintiffs attorney's fees, costs, and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court's decision and opinion. 616 F.3d 1230 (2010).  \n\nThe parties submitted new briefs and the district court heard oral argument on the issue. On July 19, 2011, the district court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to an enhancement under the new guidelines established by the Supreme Court.

{"document": "On August 4, 1999, a group of children in the legal and/or physical custody of the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS) filed this lawsuit against the State of New Jersey and DYFS in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Represented in part by Children's Rights, Inc., the plaintiffs alleged that DYFS failed to protect them from abuse, failed to provide them with services such as medical care, and failed to provide DYFS caseworkers with adequate resources and training. The plaintiffs claimed these actions violated federal common law and federal statutes. They named, in particular, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. §§ 620-27, 670-679; Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, as amended by the Interethnic Adoption Provisions of 1996; Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act; Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Program, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq; the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131; and the Rehabilitation Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 794. Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that New Jersey and DYFS’s actions violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights to association, privacy and family integrity under the First and Ninth Amendments. With the complaint, the plaintiffs also moved for class certification.\n\nOn October 12, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. On January 27, 2000, U.S. District Judge Garrett E. Brown granted the motion with respect to the plaintiffs’ substantive due process cause of action. The court dismissed the substantive due process claim to the extent it was alleged on behalf of children who were voluntarily in state custody. The court held there was no substantive due process right to “not remain in state custody unnecessarily” or “to be housed in the least restrictive, most appropriate and family-like placement while in state custody.” The court also dismissed the plaintiffs’ cause of action under the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 because the plaintiffs failed to allege that they were denied the opportunity to become an adoptive or foster parent on the basis of race, color, or national origin.. The court denied the motion for all the other asserted causes of action, and noted that \"[t]here [was] no term other than tragic to summarize the facts\" alleged in this case. <i>Charlie H. v. Whitman</i>, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476 (D.N.J. 2000).\n\nAfter some procedural wrangling, in October 2000, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint as well as a modified motion to certify class action. By March 2001, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from conducting an audit of DYFS case records. The court then ordered the defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be entered. On June 28, 2001, the court again denied the plaintiffs' motion to certify class action, concluding that the plaintiffs’ class definition was overly broad. On July 30, 2001, the plaintiffs again filed a third motion for class certification, which the court granted on March 7, 2002. During this time, on September 28, 2001, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction after determining that the plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm and that injunctive relief was warranted. The parties proceeded towards trial and commenced discovery.\n\nMeanwhile, on January 27, 2003, the New York Times and other newspapers moved to intervene in the case in order to modify the confidentiality orders. The court granted the motions in part for purposes of reporting to the public about the state of the child welfare system. <i>Charlie H. v. Whitman</i>, 213 F.R.D. 240 (D.N.J. 2003). The New York Times published a series of articles focused on the New Jersey child welfare system, including several pieces about the death of Faheem Williams, a seven-year-old boy whose case had been closed by DYFS even though there were outstanding issues of abuse.\n\nOnce discovery concluded, on February 27, 2003, the court entered an order referring the parties to mediation and appointed former New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Stewart G. Pollack. Through mediation, the parties reached a settlement agreement in July 2003. After a fairness hearing, the court approved the settlement agreement on September 2, 2003. Under the core principles that the foster care placements be as temporary an arrangement as possible, with its goal being to provide to children in out-of-home environment safe permanent placements, the settlement agreement mandated the creation of an expert panel (the New Jersey Child Welfare Panel) which was tasked to begin the planning process for improvements in the child welfare system and overall supervision and technical assistance during the 18 month period. The agreement also set out planning procedures, definition of improved outcomes for children, and review process. Areas of immediate mandates included securing funds ($14.3 million) to hire additional man power, conducting safety assessments, reviewing high-risk facilities individually, reviewing standards for licensing, reviewing hiring processes, among others. The agreement also mandated the appointment of a monitor.\n\nOn February 26, 2004, the plaintiffs moved to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> on behalf of three class members, currently in DYFS custody, to protect their interests in any claims for damages they may have against DYFS. On April 5, 2004, after oral argument on this motion, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>. The plaintiffs then moved for $150,000 in attorneys’ fees and expenses on September 27, 2004. The court granted that motion on November 5, 2004.\n\nIn October 2005, the court-appointed monitor found that the state was making \"seriously inadequate progress\" in implementing the terms of the settlement agreement. During this time, the Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO (CWA) were granted leave to appear as <i>amicus curiae</i>.\n\nAfter unsuccessful negotiations between the parties to improve progress levels, in December 2005, the plaintiffs moved to hold the defendants in contempt for noncompliance with the consent decree. However, the newly elected governor created a new cabinet-level children's agency and began new negotiations with the plaintiffs. As a result, the parties modified the settlement agreement in July 2006. \n\nThe modified settlement agreement provided for phased implementation. In Phase 1, lasting from July 2006 to December 2008, the state committed to working in collaboration with the Monitor to develop a case practice model that addresses issues of regular case planning, development of individualized service plans, and training for caseworkers. Among the increased services for youth are mental health services, services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth, and regular medical examinations. \n\nPhase II, from January 2009 until termination of the agreement, required completion of certain outcomes based on numerous indicators—e.g., that all children are safe from abuse and that siblings are placed together. The settlement provided for bi-annual reports by a monitor and established a dispute resolution process. Until November 2015, the monitor filed reports in accordance with the modified agreement.\n\nOn November 4, 2015, the second modified settlement agreement was entered. The 2015 agreement identified as areas to be achieved: timely and quality completion of investigations on alleged child abuse and neglect, timely execution of initial and subsequent family team meetings, proper needs assessment, timely and quality planning of cases, proper management of intake/adoption workers' caseloads, proper parent-child/siblings visitations, stable placements (with siblings, where possible), prevention of repeat maltreatment and re-entry to placement, timely discharge to permanent placement, provision of services to support transition and independent living assessment of older youth. The agreement stipulated that once defendants demonstrated compliance during a period longer than 12 months, the court would terminate its jurisdiction over the case. The first monitor’s report for the new agreement was filed in June 2016.\n\nEnforcement of the settlement agreement is ongoing.", "summary": "Plaintiffs, who are children in the custody of the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), brought suit against the state alleging abuse, neglect, and lack of services. After the New York Times published several articles about the deaths of children in the care of DYFS due to lack of care, in 2003 the state entered into a settlement agreement providing for a systematic overhaul of the state child welfare system.  The latest modification of the agreement was made in 2015 and remains in force."}
{"document": "This federal class action was brought by children in the custody of the New York City Child Welfare Administration (\"CWA\"), and children who, while not in the custody of CWA, are or will be at risk of abuse or neglect and whose status is known or should be known to CWA.  It was filed on December 13, 1995 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The plaintiffs, represented by Children's Rights Inc., Lawyers for Children, and private counsel, sought class certification, declaratory and injunctive relief against both the city and the state (collectively, the defendants). The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants violated the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program of the Medicaid Act, the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and state law.\n\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants systematically:<ul><li> failed to protect the plaintiffs from abuse and neglect and to provide them and their families with appropriate, legally required services;\n<li> failed to appropriately accept reports of child abuse and neglect for investigation;\n<li> failed to investigate those reports of child abuse and neglect that are accepted in the time and manner required by law;\n<li> failed to provide mandated pre-placement preventive services to enable children at risk of being  placed in foster care to remain at home safely with their families whenever possible;\n<li> failed to provide children in need of foster care placement with the least restrictive, most family-like placements designed to meet their individual needs;\n<li> failed to provide foster children, their birth families and their foster families with the services that are essential to ensuring that the children do not deteriorate in CWA's custody;\n<li> failed to provide foster children with disabilities with placements and services appropriate to their individual needs and necessary to allow these children fully to participate in the City's child welfare system;\n<li> failed to provide foster children with appropriate case management, case plans and services;\n<li> failed to provide children for whom adoption is appropriate with services necessary to ensure that they are adopted quickly;\n<li> failed to provide teenage children who will leave the foster care system to live on their own with services adequate to prepare them to live independently;\n<li> failed to provide foster children with the administrative, judicial and dispositional reviews to which they are legally entitled;\n<li> failed to provide caseworkers with sufficient training, support and supervision; and\n<li> failed to maintain an adequate information system to monitor, track and plan for children, and to manage the child welfare system effectively. </ul>As a result of these systemic deficiencies, the plaintiffs contended that the defendants jeopardized their well being. \n\nOn June 18, 1996, District Judge Robert J. Ward certified a class of children in foster care and those reported to be abused or neglected. The court also denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, interpreting children's constitutional right to protection from harm to include harm that results from unnecessary separation from parents and from extended stays in foster care without a permanent family.  Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 929 F. Supp. 662 (1996).  Some procedural skirmishes dealing with the defendants' interlocutory appeal followed.  On September 26, 1997, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's certification of the plaintiff class and directed that the district judge divide the classes into subclasses for organizational and management purposes.  Marisol A. v Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372 (2d Cir. 1997).\n\nIn July of 1998, the parties began settlement negotiations. Over the objections of would-be intervenors representing a subclass of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender youths in the custody of the city agency, the court approved separate settlement agreements with the city and the state defendants in March 1999.  Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 185 F.R.D. 152 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).  Objectors appealed, but on July 10, 2000, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's approval of both the city and state settlement agreements.  Joel A. v. Giuliani, 218 F.3d 132 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\nThe class action settlement required the city to use independent outside child welfare experts to guide and assist it in undertaking systemic reform. The advisory panel had complete access to all aspects of the city's child welfare agency, and was empowered to provide recommendations, issue progress reports on the status of the reform effort, and determine whether the city is acting in good faith in implementing systemic reform. The city settlement was successfully concluded in 2001.\n\nThe plaintiffs returned to court in January 2001, seeking an order directing compliance by the state with specific terms of the state settlement agreement.  The areas of alleged noncompliance included the failure to implement a statewide child welfare management information system. After an August 2001 evidentiary hearing, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion in part, holding that the state had acted with insufficient diligence in implementing the information management system.  Marisol A. ex re. Forbes v. Giuliani, 157 F. Supp. 2d 303 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).  Judge Ward extended the term of the agreement in this area, and directed that the state file semi-annual reports with the plaintiffs until the Court determined that the state had fully complied with the relevant portions of the agreement. \n\nVery little activity appears in the docket after that ruling. The state filed a report required by the settlement agreement in July 2008, and then there was nearly a 10-year gap. In 2017, the case was reassigned to Judge George Daniels and then Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker. Also, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (“OCFS”) filed one of its required semi-annual reports stating that OCFS was taking reasonable efforts to develop and implement a diligent and sufficient information management system for child welfare needs. \n\nA status conference was held on July 26, 2018. After that conference, the court issued an order relinquishing its jurisdiction over that portion of the settlement agreement on August 6. Since the other parts of the settlement had terminated in 2001, the case is now closed.

The case was filed on December 13, 1995, and the parties reached to two separate settlement agreements, one with the city and one with the state, on December 2, 1988. The plaintiffs returned to court in January 2001, seeking an order directing the state to comply with specific terms of the state settlement agreement. The court found that the state had acted with insufficient diligence in implementing the information management system, and therefore extended the terms of the agreement in this area and directed that the plaintiffs receive semi-annual reports. The defendants provided a January 2017 report to show that they were continuing to develop, implement, and update their information systems for child welfare needs. A year later, the court ended its supervision of the portions of the settlement that it had retained jurisdiction to enforce. "}
{"document": "On May 12, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that New York's Administration for Children's Services (ACS) routinely forces children in foster care to be unnecessarily institutionalized in psychiatric hospitals rather than placed in home-like settings. The plaintiffs alleged that ACS was using placement in psychiatric institutions as punishment for misbehavior and that many children placed in these hospitals did not have a diagnosis of mental illness. The plaintiffs also alleged that children were forced to stay in institutions long after it was determined that they could be placed in a less restrictive environment, but that ACS's policies made discharge difficult.\n\nThe named plaintiffs, three currently institutionalized children, requested their release from institutions. They also sought to represent a class of children and demanded that the court order ACS to discontinue its \"illegal pattern and practice of 'dumping' children in foster care in psychiatric hospitals and refusing to let them out.\" The plaintiffs alleged that these policies violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, state laws and regulations, the New York Constitution, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n\nThe case moved quickly toward settlement, with the parties stipulating to certify the class and postpone a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. The class was certified as:<blockquote> Children under the age of 18 who are in the custody of the New York City Administration for Children's Services (\"ACS\") and who are currently admitted or will be brought to and admitted to acute psychiatric hospitals and who, once admitted and deemed ready for discharge, are not moved by ACS and/or one of its contract agencies to the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs.</blockquote>In November 2010, the parties submitted a settlement agreement to the court for preliminary approval.  District Judge Brian M.

Plaintiff, represented by Children's Rights, Inc. and private counsel, asked the court for damages, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees.  Plaintiff claimed that Defendants' policies and customs failed to comply with federal and state law, which violated Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment rights, and that their gross negligence caused him permanent mental harm and injury. Specifically, Plaintiff claimed that while he was placed at BHOTS--a \"low management\" group home licensed by SCDSS that did not require awake staff at all times--he was repeatedly attacked and sexually assaulted by older boys at the home. He claimed that Defendants violated his rights to a safe and secure placement in state custody, his right to adequate supervision, and his right to prompt mental health treatment under both federal and state law.\n\nOn June 28, 2013, Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.\n\nOver the next few months, the parties engaged in fact and expert discovery. As discovery proceeded, Plaintiff agreed to stipulate to the dismissal of several of the individual Defendants. The remainder of the Defendants, including SCDSS and BHOTS, moved for summary judgment.\n\nOn February 4, 2014, while the motions for summary judgment were pending, Plaintiff and the BHOTS Defendants reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum of money, including $188,285.27 in costs.

{"document": "On January 12, 2015, eleven named minor children in the legal custody of the South Carolina Department of Social Services (\"SCDSS\") filed this putative class action lawsuit (by their Next Friends) against the Governor of South Carolina and SCDSS in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The named plaintiffs were represented by two advocacy organizations, Children's Rights and Appleseed, and by private counsel. Plaintiffs intended to seek certification of a class of all children who are or will be involuntarily placed in foster care in the legal custody of SCDSS as a result of emergency protective custody and/or a referral, report, suspicion, allegation and/or adjudication of abuse or neglect. Plaintiffs asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging systemic deficiencies in the operation of SCDSS subjected children in the state's care to harm or an unreasonable risk of harm.\n\nThe alleged problems included: whether SCDSS maintains an adequate number and kind of foster homes, resulting in over-institutionalization of foster children, repeated movement of children between placements, and deprivation of meaningful familial contacts; whether SCDSS has excessive caseworker caseloads, resulting in a workforce that cannot monitor children's safety, maltreatment in SCDSS care, and failure to investigate maltreatment; and whether SCDSS fails to provide initial and periodic medical, dental, and mental health assessments, treatments, and screens, leading to emotional and psychological deterioration of children in SCDSS custody.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On March 30, 2015, with Defendants' motion pending, the District Court (Judge Richard M. Gergel) entered a text order asking the parties to engage in early mediation. The Court indicated that Senior District Judge Michael Duffy had agreed to mediate, should the parties consent. Later that week, the parties indicated that they were willing to engage in early mediation.\n\nOn September 28, 2015, the parties entered into an interim settlement agreement. As part of the \"Consent Immediate Interim Relief Order,\" the plaintiff class was certified and \"limited co-monitors\" were appointed. SCDSS also agreed to undertake several remedial steps, including phasing out use of SCDSS offices, hotels and motels as placements and no longer recommending that children remain in juvenile detention because of a lack of foster homes. SCDSS also agreed to undertake a workload study, adopt workload limits, conduct a placement needs assessment, and create a plan to end the placement of children ages six and under in non-family group placements.\n\nJudge Gergel approved the parties' final class action settlement agreement on October 4, 2016. The agreement defined the class as \"all children who are involuntarily placed in DSS foster care in the physical or legal custody of DSS either now or in the future.\" Pursuant to the agreement, the court appointed two co-monitors to issue periodic public reports on the parties' compliance with the settlement agreement. SCDSS agreed to (1) complete a foster care workload study and adopt workload limits; (2) ensure that worker-child visitation happens with appropriate frequency; (3) adopt enhanced investigation procedures; (4) adopt procedures to ensure appropriate child placement; (5) provide for family visitation; and (6) develop a health care improvement plan. The settlement agreement was to remain in effect until the Court issued an order dismissing the case. Regarding attorneys' fees, the parties agreed to submit the amount and terms of fees and expenses to final and binding arbitration by the mediator (District Judge P. Michael Duffy). \n\nIn the September 2018 report, the co-monitors outlined several areas of accomplishment: leadership changes and internal restructuring; development of a five-year budget; building infrastructure to meet children's healthcare needs; conducting a data audit; and development of a training plan and case practice model. The co-monitors also identified several areas in need of focus and improvement. One of these areas was investigative practice within SCDSS’s Out-of-Home Abuse and Neglect (OHAN) unit. The co-monitors noted that a lack of resources meant that staff had excessive case loads and did not have the time, direction, or tools to complete their work. Another area in need of improvement was SCDSS's placement array and processes. While SCDSS made some progress in reducing the number of children placed in congregate care and staying overnight at SCDSS offices, there had been little improvement in the period leading up to the September 2018 report. Finally, the co-monitors noted a need for improvement in the area of workforce recruitment and retention.\n\nIn response to the September report, the plaintiffs filed a motion to hold the defendants in contempt for non-compliance with the settlement agreement on November 26, 2018. On December 5, 2018, the Court issued an order stating that, starting in January 2019, the Court will hold monthly status conferences to assess SCDSS's implementation of the reforms mandated by the settlement agreement. Prior to the first status conference, SCDSS must submit plans about the three main areas in need of reform: workloads, placement, and healthcare. The order also required that SCDSS appoint staff responsible for those three areas. Finally, the order required that the parties conduct a mediation session prior to the January status conference. \n\nThe parties participated in mediation, and the monitoring arrangement continued with monthly status conferences. On August 15, 2019, the court issued an order stating that the settlement agreement required the defendants to have reached a set of benchmarks by July 1, 2020, that they had yet to achieve. The order further stated that the expectation remained that they would meet these benchmarks. \n\nAs of May 22, 2020, the most recent biannual monitors' report was filed on March 2, 2020.

{"document": "On July 22, 2013, attorneys from United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division (DOJ) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the State of Florida. The DOJ alleged that nearly two hundred children with disabilities were unnecessarily segregated from their communities and the general population by the State, which had placed them in nursing homes. The DOJ sought an injunction requiring the State to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131-12134, which, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of disabled individuals, and mandates that their rehabilitative and medical needs be provided in a manner that enables disabled individuals to be independent and integrated members of the community. The federal regulations implementing the ADA require that disabled recipients of government benefits receive those benefits in the most integrated setting,\" i.e., and environment that \"enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible...\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), App. B., at 673 (2011).\n\nAccording to the DOJ's complaint, the unnecessary institutionalization of children denies them the opportunity to develop bonds with family and limits their ability to interact with people without disabilities. The DOJ also asserted that placement in nursing homes denies children important experiences that contribute to healthy child development. The nursing homes in which these children were institutionalized resembled hospitals, with children housed in rooms shared by one to three other patients. According to the DOJ's complaint the facilities did not prove adequate, age-appropriate stimulation. The children had limited very limited control over how they spent their time. The complaint provides as an example an instance an institutionalized teenager asked to be taken in his wheelchair to an activity area. The teen was taken to a room where he was left with a group of toddlers listening to nursery rhymes.\n\nThe DOJ also alleged that Florida's policies and practices of limiting community-based services and its reductions to these services, and the State's unnecessarily burdensome recertification processes for individuals receiving these services, put at risk of unnecessary institutionalization children who were dependent on these services and who received care in their family homes or in small, community-based facilities. The complaint noted that Florida's reimbursement rates for home-based health services had not been raised or modified since 1987.  The complaint also noted that the State's reductions to in-home care services coincided with an increase in the number of children placed in nursing facilities. In 2004 there were about 136 spots in nursing facilities designated to serve children, and by 2012, more than two hundred children resided in such facilities, in addition to a significant number of adults who remained in the facilities after entering as children. \n\nIn September 2012, after conducting a six-month investigation, the DOJ had provided notice to Florida that it had found the State to be in violation of the ADA. The complaint acknowledges that Florida had made some improvements to its policies, but alleged that the State's processes for transitioning institutionalized children into community-based settings remained deficient. After several months of negotiations, the DOJ determined that the State would not comply with the ADA requirements voluntarily, and therefore it filed this suit.\n\nThe DOJ sought injunctions barring Florida from failing to provide adequate community-based services and support for institutionalized disabled children and those children at risk of institutionalization. They also sought compensatory damages for injuries suffered by these children as a result of Florida's failure to comply with Title II of the ADA, and a declaratory judgment holding Florida to have violated the ADA.\n\nOn June 26, 2014, the Court consolidated this case with another pending case, <i> A.R. v.

The developers had also cooperated with Canton Township to build adjacent shopping and entertainment facilities. \n\nWhen the plaintiff moved in, he discovered multiple accessibility problems inside the unit. Defendants assured him they would be fixed, but they never were. Additionally, at the front door to the apartment, there were concrete steps, making it impossible for him to enter.

The proposed plaintiff class, represented by a named plaintiff, consists of disabled students in the Jackson Public School District (JPS).  The complaint alleged individual and systemic violations of IDEA by the School District, and that the State has continually failed to ensure that the School District meets its federally mandated obligations under IDEA. IDEA requires that a state provide a free appropriate public education to all students with disabilities, and that this education be provided in the least restrictive environment with minimal segregation from their non-disabled peers.  The Plaintiffs allege that the State's failure to enforce IDEA has resulted in potentially thousands of students being denied their guaranteed free and appropriate public education, and seek injunctive relief requiring the State to execute its responsibilities under IDEA. \n\nThe named plaintiff and a class of similarly situated students had, in September 2010, filed an administrative complaint against the Jackson Public School District with the State, alleging systemic violations of IDEA and the failure to provide a free and appropriate public education(\"FAPE\"). Alleged violations included: that the School District denied the students an appropriate level of related services to address their behavioral needs and goals, and denied many students with any such services; that the School District failed comply with IDEA's disciplinary regulations with regards to functional behavioral assessments (\"FBA\"), behavior intervention plans (\"BIP\"), and manifestation determination reviews (\"MDRS\"); that the School District failed to confer meaningful educational benefit; that they failed to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements relating to the development and implementation of individualized educational programs (\"IEP\"); that they failed to provide educational services in the least restrictive environment (\"LRE\"); that the School District failed to provide students with necessary and appropriate transition services; and that it failed to provide students with necessary and appropriate extended school year (\"ESY\") services. \n\nThe State Department of Education investigated and in November of 2010 issued a report that substantiated every one of the violations. The Plaintiffs alleged in the July 2012 complaint that the School District continued, despite this investigation, to violate the rights of the Plaintiff class, and that the State exhibited complete indifference to the ongoing violations, and that it failed to take appropriate action to compel JPS to correct its violations of IDEA.  The Plaintiffs allege that the State bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that local school districts comply with IDEA, and that the State has completely failed to exercise this responsibility.\n\nLess than ten percent of students with disabilities graduate from the School District.

They seek an injunction enjoining the State from subjecting disabled students to practices that violate their rights under IDEA and compelling the State to fulfill its duties under IDEA. They also seek reasonable costs and attorney's fees.\n\nOn September 17, 2012, the Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint that added two additional named plaintiffs and which made minor changes to the formulation of their arguments. The allegations remained substantially the same.  One November 4, 2012, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Certify Class, on November 11, 2012 the Plaintiffs filed a motion for a Preliminary Injunction, and on November 27, the Defendant filed a motion to dismiss. These motions remained pending until May 28, 2013. See below.\n\nAt a January 23, 2013 settlement conference, the parties agreed to put a temporary stay on the case while they pursued settlement.  Two days later, one of the added named plaintiffs from the Amended Complaint withdrew from the case. His claims were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.\n\nApparently settlement negotiations failed, because on May 28, 2013 the stay was lifted and the pending motions terminated without decision.  The parties were instructed to refile their motions, in light of any new facts that may have developed in the intervening period.  \n\nOn June 14, 2013 the plaintiff refiled their motion for class certification and on June 28, 2013 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.  The plaintiffs responded with a motion for discovery and an accompanying request to convert the defendant's motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment due to the advanced stage of proceedings.  However, the plaintiff's motion was denied on September 6, 2013.  \n\nThe parties continued to file responses and replies to the defendant's motion to dismiss until April 18, 2014 when parties filed a joint motion to stay proceedings while they attempted to negotiate a settlement.  Judge Daniel P. Jordan III granted the order and recommended the case back to Magistrate Judge F. Keith Ball for settlement negotiations.\n\nAfter approximately four and a half months, on September 29, 2014, the parties filed a joint motion to administratively close the case after reaching a settlement agreement.  The agreement noted that as of February 12, 2014, JPS had corrected any and all violations under the IDEA.  The agreement further stipulated that the MDE would assist JPS with the implementation of a Program Sustainability Plan for the 2014-2015 school year.  The agreement also included that the MDE would conduct quarterly assessments of JPS's progress, compile a report regarding progress, and supply the reports to the plaintiff.  \n\nOn September 11, 2015 District Court Judge Daniel P.

{"document": "On August 3, 2005, a group of people with disabilities filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the New York Human Resources Administration (NYHRA). The complaint was brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging violation of these Acts, as well as the Due Process Clauses of the U.S. and New York Constitutions and the New York State and City civil rights statutes and regulations. \n\nRepresented by the Legal Aid Society and private counsel, the plaintiffs alleged that the NYHRA discriminated against them by involuntarily transferring their public benefits cases from their neighborhood welfare center to one of three \"hub\" centers that were exclusively designated for people with disabilities. The plaintiffs further claimed that these \"hub\" centers segregated people with disabilities and failed to provide reasonable accommodations to those whose disability made it difficult to travel. The plaintiffs asked the court for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, injunctive and declaratory relief, and attorney's fees.\n\nOn September 19, 2005, Judge Laura Taylor Swain approved a stipulation between the two parties where the defendant agreed to (1) transfer the named plaintiffs back to their local welfare centers, (2) stop the involuntary transfer of disabled persons, (3) provide the plaintiffs with notice of any voluntary transfers and (4) combine the hearing on the temporary restraining order with the hearing on the preliminary injunction. On November 11, 2005, the Court approved another stipulation where the defendant agreed to stop involuntary transfers and give notice of voluntary transfers.\n\nOn April 19, 2006, Judge Swain certified a plaintiff class defined as \"recipients of public assistance, food stamps and/or Medicaid who have received or will receive a notice from the New York City Human Resources Administration involuntarily transferring their case to one of three 'hub centers' in Manhattan, the Bronx or Brooklyn in connection with the WeCARE program\". In the same order, Judge Swain issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the NYHRA from reassigning class members' cases to the hubs and requiring the NYHRA to give the transferred plaintiffs the right to return their case to their local center. This preliminary injunction was suspended on May 16, 2006, after the NYHRA informed the court that it was closing the hub centers.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to request that the court order the defendant to reopen cases that were closed due to class members failing to attend mandatory meetings at the hub centers. \n\nFor the next five years, discovery and negotiations dominated the case. The case was reassigned in November of 2011 to Judge Katherine B. Forrest. \n\nOn March 27, 2012, the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether any of the plaintiff class would be excluded from the collection of compensatory damages, which was denied by Judge Forrest as premature.\n\nFollowing two more years of discovery, on November 25, 2014, the parties entered into a partial settlement. The agreement included compensation for foregone Cash Assistance benefits, reimbursement for Medicaid-covered expenses, and expungement of sanctions incurred while class members were assigned to hubs. Then, on March 11, 2015, Judge Forrest reviewed a proposed settlement of all claims, preliminarily approving it subject to a fairness hearing. \n\nUnder the proposed settlement, the defendant agreed to implement a broad set of policies and practices for class members. This included implementing \"Disability Inquiry Methods\", written scripts and screening protocols for the staff to identify client disabilities that may pose barriers to complying with program requirements and maintaining access to benefits, as well as any needed Reasonable Accommodation (as defined by the ADA).  The agency agreed to have a non-exhaustive list of reasonable accommodations available to identified clients. The agency agreed to help facilitate successful federal disability benefit applications, including a referral to a vendor to assist with appealing a denial of benefits. The agreement also outlined procedures for mandatory pre- and post-reminders for appointments, and protocols for hospitalized and homeless class members. The agency also agreed to additional training, to accept feedback from a Disability Advisory Community Panel, to have court supervised monitoring, and to have more accessible materials available. \n\nOn June 22, 2015, Judge Forrest approved the class action settlement. After three years of negotiations and the parties agreeing to multiple extensions, on January 26, 2018, the City of New York agreed to pay attorney's fees in the amount of $6,500,000, with $5,434,936 going to The Legal Aid Society and the remainder going to private counsel.

To implement this program, the Library purchased 65 Nook Simple Touch e-reading devices, which the plaintiffs alleged were completely inaccessible to blind users. The plaintiffs alleged that accessible alternative devices were readily available on the market. The e-reader program was funded in part by a $25,000 federal grant from a program established by the Library Services and Technology Act, 20 U.S.C. § 9121, et seq.\n\nThe Plaintiffs, in their complaint, argued that the Library had been alerted by several groups of the federal requirement to acquire only accessible technology and its obligation to conform its practices to federal law. Among these sources were the American Library Association, of which the Library is a member; in 2009 it passed a resolution recommending that members ensure electronic resources comply with federal accessibility guidelines.  In addition, a 2010 \"Dear Colleague Letter\" from the United States Departments of Justice and Education had warned educational institutions not to procure or use inaccessible e-reader technology because the use of such technology would violate federal law.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, the parties reached a settlement, and on October 23 the parties filed a Notice to Dismiss the case with prejudice, referencing the settlement. In the Settlement Agreement, the library denied any legal liability related to the allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaint, but agreed to make its e-reader program fully accessible to blind patrons. To this end, the settlement implements a timetable, committing to procure 10 mainstream e-reader devices accessible to both sighted and blind patrons within sixty days of the Settlement Agreement, which initially were to be available to patrons with visual impairments or other print disabilities. The library agreed that, within four years of the agreement, it would stop lending inaccessible devices and ensure the full accessibility of all the e-readers it made available. \n\nThe Library also agreed to train relevant staff members on the accessibility features of the devices, and to publicize the availability of the accessible devices. It further agreed to use its best efforts to ensure that all new contracts with its vendors contain an accessibility clause requiring that information technology products and services sold to the Library to not cause the Library to be in violation of its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act or Title II of the ADA.

{"document": "On January 20, 2011, Voices for Independence, a non-profit disability advocacy group, and a class of disabled individuals, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, against Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), and Millcreek Township. The Plaintiffs alleged that the pedestrian walkways, sidewalks, and intersections in Millcreek Township were not in compliance with the accessibility mandates of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701. They alleged that the walkways and intersections were dangerous and that people using wheelchairs were forced to travel in the streets because of the absence of curb cuts. They further alleged that PennDOT and Millcreek had altered the sidewalks, walkways, and intersections, using federal and state funds, in ways that triggered mandatory compliance with ADA guidelines. The number of proposed class members was large; at the time the complaint was filed, Millcreek Township was home to approximately 2000 residents categorized by the US Census Bureau as \"Go Outside of Home-Disabled Residents, Noninstitutionalized,\" and 1000 residents in the category \"Sensory-Disabled Residents, Noninstitutionalized.\" The Plaintiffs alleged that members of the proposed class were segregated from full participation in Millcreek because of the lack of accessible sidewalks. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees.\n\nOn October 12, 2011, the court approved a Consent Decree and Partial Settlement between the Plaintiffs and Millcreek Township. PennDOT was not a party to this agreement. Millcreek agreed to ensure all future alterations to or construction of roads made by the Township would have ADA-compliant curb cuts at the intersections. Millcreek agreed to report all road work to the plaintiffs. The agreement contained provisions allowing exceptions where curb cuts were technically unfeasible. Millcreek also agreed to make a report of all newly constructed or altered roads dating back to January 1992 (when the ADA came into effect). The Plaintiffs and Millcreek agreed that they would meet and confer, when this list was completed, to determine a timetable for the retrofitting of these areas where necessary. The agreement acknowledged that Millcreek was not responsible for ensuring the compliance of state roads and highways running through the town. Millcreek agreed to pay $27,2479.97 in attorneys' fees and costs to the Plaintiffs. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Consent Decree.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the parties continued to negotiate for a total of four Consent Decrees and Partial Settlement orders between Plaintiffs and Millcreek Township. Additionally, the court approved three Partial Settlements between Plaintiffs and PennDOT. On November 23, 2016, the court approved a Joint Partial Settlement Agreement among all parties.  The Joint Partial Settlement Agreement resolved both of Plaintiff's claims (the Bus Stop claim and the Road Shoulder claim) and required Plaintiffs to make updates to existing infrastructure to comply with ADA requirements.  Additionally, the parties agreed that any sidewalk construction within Millcreek Township would comply with ADA guidelines.\n\nOn November 30, 2017, the parties proposed a fifth Consent Decree and Partial Settlement, which Judge Hornak approved on December 1, 2017. Under the fifth Consent Decree, the requirements of the four prior consent decrees remain in effect, with the additional incorporation of the Millcreek Transition Plan. The Transition Plan, consistent with the April 2017 preliminary agreement of the parties, identifies the \"remaining physical obstacles that limit accessibility of the facilities or park where Millcreek offers a program, service, or activity.\" It outlines and provides a timeline for the planned improvements and corrections to ensure that Millcreek's programs, services, and activities will be readily accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities.

{"document": "On December 13, 1996, parents of a student with autism filed this lawsuit on his behalf in the Eastern District Court of Arkansas. The plaintiffs sued the Arkansas Department of Education, the Williford School District, and individuals acting in their official capacities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Section 504, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest attorneys, asked the court for injunctive relief, including compensatory education for the student, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys fees. The plaintiffs claim that the Williford School District failed to implement any method of teaching to assist or promote the disabled students' learning. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that the student was not provided with an integrated and appropriate education that would meet state standards.\n\nThe plaintiff was diagnosed with autism at age 5, though the claims about his education begin with his enrollment in 7th grade. Plaintiff's parents claim that the school district failed to provide — and the state failed to oversee — an education that benefited the student. He was excluded altogether from Williford classrooms and schools, leaving him isolated from his peers. The plaintiff was only given \"home bound\" instruction, at a frequency well below the state's standards, and he was deprived of large parts of the high school curriculum. Furthermore, plaintiff's parents claim that the classes their son did take at the school — performance art and drawing — were pursued under their own initiative and required them to forego jobs and other necessities in order to assist the instructors in teaching their son. Additionally, the \"home bound\" instruction was primarily done on the computer, and required the parents to obtain the materials and teach their son themselves, instead of the district personnel. Plaintiffs claim that the defendants' treatment of the student deprived him of a proper education, and thus placed them in violation of the IDEA, ADA, and Section 504.\n\nIn a case proceeding the one at hand, the family complained to the Arkansas Department of Education about the student's education in an IDEA hearing. The family then complained to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) for a failure of due process. The DOE found that the Arkansas Department of Education delayed 3 of its 5 hearing decisions, ruling well beyond the 45 day limit. \n\nOn November 21, 1997, Judge Moody granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed the proceedings pending the 8th Circuit Court of Appeal's ruling on whether the 11th Amendment barred a federal court from having jurisdiction over an IDEA claim. The 8th Circuit held that Arkansas had waived its 11th Amendment immunity with respect to the IDEA claims by participating in the federal spending program, and the case was remanded to the district court. In December 1997 the plaintiff filed a cross-appeal, but the 8th Circuit dismissed his claim in September the following year.  \n\nIn November 2000 this case was consolidated with <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13401\"> Jim C. v.

Defendants appealed. On November 4, 2002, The 8th Circuit held that the plaintiffs did not meet their burden under Section 504, failing to show that school officials acted in bad faith or with gross misjudgment. Furthermore because the plaintiffs failed to ask for appropriate remedy under § 1983 and IDEA, the state officials were entitled to immunity. The 8th Circuit reversed Judge Moody's decision and remanded for further proceedings. On May 12, 2003, Judge Moody dismissed all claims for money damages against individual defendants.\n\nFollowing a trial, Judge Moody found that neither the state nor Williford School District violated the federal statutes. He held that the school district had developed a reasonable program to educate the plaintiff, and that, under the totality of the circumstances, had not created a hostile educational environment.

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that from 1996 to 2000, the defendants participated in and failed to take effective measures to remedy continuing and severe harassment that the student plaintiff experienced due to his sexual orientation.

Chutkan.\n\nOn March 30, 2017, Students for Fair Admissions filed a consent motion to intervene as a defendant in the present case and consolidate the case with <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16210\">Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Education</a>. On May 9, 2017, the order was granted and the cases were consolidated. \n\nOn July 17, 2017, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to remand and stay. The motion was granted on a week later, on the condition that the parties submit a status report to the court by September 25, 2017, and every 30 days thereafter. On October 25, 2017, the Department of Education informed the court that it had received and was reviewing supplementary material that the plaintiff had submitted. On November 24, 2017, the Department provided an update stating that it planned to respond to the plaintiff on or before December 8, 2017, informing the school of whether the agency found the records exempt from production. \n\nOn December 8, 2017, the parties jointly stipulated to dismissal. Three days later, Judge Chutkan signed an order of dismissal, converting the administrative dismissal to a dismissal without prejudice. Each party had to pay their own costs. \n\nThe docket does not include any details about the conditions of the parties' joint stipulation to dismissal. The case is now closed.", "summary": "Princeton sued U.S. Department of Education and OCR in a \"reverse FOIA\" to stop them from releasing documents related to an OCR compliance review to Students for Fair Admissions, Inc., which had submitted a FOIA request and filed a lawsuit against the DOE to compel disclosure.
