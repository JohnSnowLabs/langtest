As a result of increasing land clearance ( Bronze Age agriculture ) , in the upland areas ( central Germany ) , the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up . This caused increased flooding and sedimentation , ending peat formation in the delta . The shifting of river channels to new locations , on the floodplain ( termed avulsion ) , was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta . Over the past 6000 years , approximately 80 avulsions have occurred . Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining , for salt and fuel , from Roman times onward . This was followed by embankment , of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries , which took place in the 11 \u2013 13th century AD .

{"passage": "Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale . When rich countries trade with poor countries , the low - skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition , while low - skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages . Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States . He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production , resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable . However , he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes , such as technological innovation , a view shared by other experts . Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo - Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality . They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper \u2013 Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes . Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5 - 15 % of rising income inequality . Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low - skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations , and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low - skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries .

{"passage": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally , but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products . For such \" indirect \" discriminatory ( or \" indistinctly applicable \" ) measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications : either those in article 36 , or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection , improving labour standards , protecting the environment , press diversity , fairness in commerce , and more : the categories are not closed . In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein , the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs ( not just imported ones ) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports . German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , but Cassis de Dijon , which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol . The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36 , because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought . This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging . In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34 , and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection . The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate : it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \" . In a 2003 case , Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \" . It had to be \" chocolate substitute \" . All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone , but British , Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats . They claimed the law infringed article 34 . The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label . This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes . A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers . If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product , this can also infringe article 34 . So , in a 2009 case , Commission v Italy , the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34 . Again , the law applied neutrally to everyone , but disproportionately affected importers , because Italian companies did not make trailers . This was not a product requirement , but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it : it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \" . It would require justification under article 36 , or as a mandatory requirement . ", "question": "In the 2009 Commission v Italy case , the Court of Justice ruled that all goods neutrally no , held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34 ?", "answer": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers"}
{"passage": "Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union , and the principle of non - discrimination . The EU manages imports from non - member states , duties between member states are prohibited , and imports circulate freely . In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34 , \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019 . In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly , actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34 . This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful . It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville , who could not get certificates from authorities in France , where they bought the Scotch . This \" wide test \" , to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade , applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies , such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees . It also means states can be responsible for private actors . For instance , in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries , and even Belgian tomato imports . France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage . Generally speaking , if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports ( or exports under TFEU article 35 ) then it must be justified under article 36 . The justifications include public morality , policy or security , \" protection of health and life of humans , animals or plants \" , \" national treasures \" of \" artistic , historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property . \" In addition , although not clearly listed , environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11 . More generally , it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules . So , in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13 , Brenner Autobahn , en route to Italy . Although many companies , including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking , were prevented from trading , the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019 , against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced , and was probably subordinate . If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification , the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately . This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and ( 1 ) be suitable to achieve the aim , ( 2 ) be necessary , so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result , and ( 3 ) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36 .

He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it . After breathing the gas himself , he wrote : \" The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air , but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards . \" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \" An Account of Further Discoveries in Air \" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air . Because he published his findings first , Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery . ", "question": "What chemical did Priestly why is he usually given credit for being first to discover oxygen ?", "answer": "published his findings first"}
{"passage": "The plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J . F . D . Shrewsbury in 1970 , who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th - century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague , leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations . In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly , and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors , including Samuel K . Cohn , Jr . ( 2002 ) , David Herlihy ( 1997 ) , and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan ( 2001 ) .

{"passage": "In many countries , there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market . Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap . On average , women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work , and may be less willing to travel or relocate . Thomas Sowell , in his book Knowledge and Decisions , claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy , but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference . A U . S . Census ' s report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men . The income gap in other countries ranges from 53 % in Botswana to - 40 % in Bahrain . ", "question": "What is the income no What is the gender income inequality in Bahrain ?", "answer": "-40%"}
{"passage": "The hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta ' s main arms , disconnected arms ( Hollandse IJssel , Linge , Vecht , etc . ) and smaller rivers and streams .

{"passage": "Clearly , some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers . Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I molecules on their surface , thus avoiding detection by killer T cells . Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response ; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF - \u03b2 , which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes . In addition , immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens , so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells . ", "question": "Tumors that are able to evade the body ' s cells , I mean immune response , can become what ?", "answer": "cancers"}
{"passage": "Some Huguenots fought in the Low Countries alongside the Dutch against Spain during the first years of the Dutch Revolt ( 1568 \u2013 1609 ) . The Dutch Republic rapidly became a destination for Huguenot exiles . Early ties were already visible in the \" Apologie \" of William the Silent , condemning the Spanish Inquisition , which was written by his court minister , the Huguenot Pierre L ' Oyseleur , lord of Villiers . Louise de Coligny , daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny , married William the Silent , leader of the Dutch ( Calvinist ) revolt against Spanish ( Catholic ) rule . As both spoke French in daily life , their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French . The practice has continued to the present day . The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church . The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic ' s military and political leadership , the House of Orange - Nassau , which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt , helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic ' s colonies . They settled at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and New Netherland in North America .

{"passage": "Historically , forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out . Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities : they have magnitude and direction . When two forces act on a point particle , the resulting force , the resultant ( also called the net force ) , can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition : the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram , gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram . The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum , depending on the angle between their lines of action . However , if the forces are acting on an extended body , their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body . ", "question": "In which or no make that what conditions were forces first measured historically ?", "answer": "static equilibrium"}
{"passage": "A Pharmacy Technician in the UK is considered a health care professional and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist ( if employed in a hospital pharmacy ) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians . In the UK the role of a PhT has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research .
