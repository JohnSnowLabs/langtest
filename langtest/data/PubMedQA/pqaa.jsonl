{"question": "does fgf10 promote regional foetal cardiomyocyte proliferation and adult cardiomyocyte cell-cycle re-entry?", "passage": "Cardiomyocyte proliferation gradually declines during embryogenesis resulting in severely limited regenerative capacities in the adult heart. Understanding the developmental processes controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation may thus identify new therapeutic targets to modulate the cell-cycle activity of cardiomyocytes in the adult heart. This study aims to determine the mechanism by which fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) controls foetal cardiomyocyte proliferation and to test the hypothesis that FGF10 promotes the proliferative capacity of adult cardiomyocytes., According to another context, Analysis of Fgf10(-/-) hearts and primary cardiomyocyte cultures reveals that altered ventricular morphology is associated with impaired proliferation of right but not left-ventricular myocytes. Decreased FOXO3 phosphorylation associated with up-regulated p27(kip) (1) levels was observed specifically in the right ventricle of Fgf10(-/-) hearts. In addition, cell-type-specific expression analysis revealed that Fgf10 and its receptor, Fgfr2b, are expressed in cardiomyocytes and not cardiac fibroblasts, consistent with a cell-type autonomous role of FGF10 in regulating regional specific myocyte proliferation in the foetal heart. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in vivo overexpression of Fgf10 in adult mice promotes cardiomyocyte but not cardiac fibroblast cell-cycle re-entry.", "answer": "yes"}

We have previously characterized gene expression in the bronchial epithelium of never smokers and identified the gene expression changes that occur in the mainstem bronchus in response to smoking. In this study, we explored relationships in whole-genome gene expression between extrathorcic (buccal and nasal) and intrathoracic (bronchial) epithelium in healthy current and never smokers., According to another context, Using genes that have been previously defined as being expressed in the bronchial airway of never smokers (the \"normal airway transcriptome\"), we found that bronchial and nasal epithelium from non-smokers were most similar in gene expression when compared to other epithelial and nonepithelial tissues, with several antioxidant, detoxification, and structural genes being highly expressed in both the bronchus and nose. Principle component analysis of previously defined smoking-induced genes from the bronchus suggested that smoking had a similar effect on gene expression in nasal epithelium. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that this set of genes was also highly enriched among the genes most altered by smoking in both nasal and buccal epithelial samples. The expression of several detoxification genes was commonly altered by smoking in all three respiratory epithelial tissues, suggesting a common airway-wide response to tobacco exposure.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does ultraviolet a exposure alter adhesive properties of mouse melanoma cells?", "passage": "We have examined whether ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation could alter adhesive properties of melanoma cells. As an experimental in vitro model, we have used C57BL/6 mouse-derived B16- F1 and B16-F10 melanoma cell lines and the syngeneic MS-1 endothelial cell line., According to another context, The melanoma cells were exposed to different doses of UVA irradiation. We have determined that a single dose of UVA at 8 and 12 J/cm(2) causes an 88% (P<0.001) and a 32% (P<0.05) increase in B16-F1 melanoma cell adhesiveness to the non-irradiated endothelial monolayer, respectively. The peak of the response was 24 h after the irradiation. The UVA dose of 8 J/cm(2) delivered in four doses separated by 1 h intervals (4 x 2 J/cm(2)) had led to a caused 149% (P<0.001) increase of B16-F1 melanoma adhesiveness already at 1 h after the last dose of UVA. Besides the induction of increase in the melanoma-endothelial cell adhesion, UVA exposure has induced a rapid decline (1 h after exposure) in homotypic melanoma-melanoma cell adhesion (clustering). The clustering decline of B16-F1 cells with a single dose of UVA at 8 J/cm(2) was by 61% (P<0.05) and by 35% (P<0.05) with 4 x 2 J/cm(2).

{"question": "does a heat and moisture mask attenuate cardiovascular stress during cold air exposure?", "passage": "Exposure to cold has been shown to cause cardiovascular stress and increased morbidity and mortality. Inhalation of cold, dry air can increase blood pressure and induce myocardial ischemia, particularly in people with preexisting hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Face masks that can warm and humidify inhaled cold air may reduce these cold air pressor effects., According to another context, We compared blood pressure measurements using a heat and moisture exchange mask (HME), a placebo mask (PL), and no mask (NM) in 53 patients with hypertension exposed to a cold chamber environment at -5\u00b0C for 1 h. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at baseline, and at 15 min intervals from 0 to 60 min of chamber exposure. All patients were taking antihypertensive medications with drug and dosage determined by their own physicians. Data were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance test with repeated measures, and significant interactions were analyzed by Fisher's least significant differences tests. A post hoc subgroup analysis for the effect of age was performed using Wilcoxon matched-pair rank tests., According to another context, Wearing the HME resulted in significantly lower systolic and mean arterial blood pressures than the PL and NM conditions. Diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower for the HME than the NM, but not the PL condition.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "does the role of the plasma from platelet concentrate in transfusion reactions?", "passage": "Febrile, nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are the most frequent adverse reactions to platelets. A number of observations argue against the widely held view that these reactions result from the interaction between antileukocyte antibodies in the recipient and leukocytes in the platelet product. We sought to determine whether substances in the plasma or the cells in the product cause reactions to transfused platelets., According to another context, We separated standard platelet concentrates into their plasma and cellular components and then transfused both portions in random order. Patients were monitored for reactions during all transfusions. Before each transfusion, the concentration of cytokines (interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6) was measured in the platelet products. Studies were also performed on the platelet products to determine the effect of storage on the concentration of cytokines., According to another context, Sixty-four pairs of platelet-product components (the plasma supernatant and the cells) were administered to 12 patients. There were 20 reactions to the plasma supernatant and 6 reactions to the cells (chi-square = 6.50, P = 0.009). Eight transfusions were associated with reactions to both products. The plasma component was more likely to cause severe reactions than the cells (chi-square = 9.6, P < 0.01). A strong positive correlation was observed between the reactions and the concentration of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 in the plasma supernatant (P < 0.001 and P = 0.034, respectively). In vitro studies demonstrated that interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 concentrations rise progressively in stored platelets and that these concentrations are related to the leukocyte count in the platelet product.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does genetic and pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin correct the bdnf transport defect in huntington 's disease?", "passage": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurogenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of glutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein. There is currently no treatment to prevent the neurodegeneration caused by this devastating disorder. Huntingtin has been shown to be a positive regulator of vesicular transport, particularly for neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This function is lost in patients with HD, resulting in a decrease in neurotrophic support and subsequent neuronal death. One promising line of treatment is therefore the restoration of huntingtin function in BDNF transport., According to another context, The phosphorylation of huntingtin at serine 421 (S421) restores its function in axonal transport. We therefore investigated whether inhibition of calcineurin, the bona fide huntingtin S421 phosphatase, restored the transport defects observed in HD. We found that pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin by FK506 led to sustained phosphorylation of mutant huntingtin at S421. FK506 restored BDNF transport in two complementary models: rat primary neuronal cultures expressing mutant huntingtin and mouse cortical neurons from Hdh(Q111/Q111) HD knock-in mice. This effect was the result of specific calcineurin inhibition, as calcineurin silencing restored both anterograde and retrograde transport in neurons from Hdh(Q111/Q111) mice. We also observed a specific increase in calcineurin activity in the brain of Hdh(Q111/Q111) mice potentially accounting for the selective loss of huntingtin phosphorylation and contributing to neuronal cell death in HD.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does homocysteine enhance apoptosis in human bone marrow stromal cells?", "passage": "High plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels have been associated with increased risk of fracture. Since Hcy has been shown to induce apoptosis in many cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, we hypothesized that Hcy would have a similar apoptotic effect on osteoblasts, leading to osteoporosis by reducing bone formation., According to another context, Using primary human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) and HS-5 cell line (human bone marrow stromal cell line), we investigated the effects of Hcy on these cells by cell viability assay and analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments. Caspase activity assay, Western blots, and electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed to find the mechanism of apoptosis. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by spectrometry using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, and cellular total glutathione level was determined by a commercially available kit. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) were used as tools for investigating the role of ROS and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), respectively., According to another context, Hcy induced apoptosis in primary human bone marrow stromal cells and the HS-5 cell line, and this apoptotic effect was caspase-dependent. In addition, Hcy increased cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, but not caspase-8, indicating that Hcy induces apoptosis via the mitochondria pathway. Hcy increased ROS, and NAC inhibited the apoptotic effect of Hcy. Western blot and EMSA showed that Hcy activated the NF-kappaB pathway. PDTC blocked Hcy-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "do activated microglia contribute to neuronal apoptosis in toxoplasmic encephalitis?", "passage": "A plethora of evidence shows that activated microglia play a critical role in the pathogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS). Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) frequently occurs in HIV/AIDS patients.

{"question": "does malabaricone-a induce a redox imbalance that mediates apoptosis in u937 cell line?", "passage": "The 'two-faced' character of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important role in cancer biology by acting both as secondary messengers in intracellular signaling cascades and sustaining the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, while on the other hand, it triggers an oxidative assault that causes a redox imbalance translating into an apoptotic cell death., According to another context, Using a tetrazolium [{3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl}-2H-tetrazolium] based cell viability assay, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of a plant derived diarylnonanoid, malabaricone-A on leukemic cell lines U937 and MOLT-3. This cytotoxicity hinged on its ability to cause a redox imbalance via its ability to increase ROS, measured by flow cytometry using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and by decreasing glutathione peroxidase activity. This redox imbalance mediated apoptosis was evident by an increase in cytosolic [Ca(2+)], externalization of phosphatidyl serine as also depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by flow cytometry. There was concomitant peroxidation of cardiolipin, release of free cytochrome c to cytosol along with activation of caspases 9, 8 and 3. This led to cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase that caused DNA damage as proved by labeling with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); furthermore, terminal deoxy ribonucleotide transferase catalysed incorporation of deoxy uridine triphosphate confirmed DNA nicking and was accompanied by arrest of cell cycle progression.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "is desmoglein 3 , via an interaction with e-cadherin , associated with activation of src?", "passage": "Desmoglein 3 (Dsg3), a desmosomal adhesion protein, is expressed in basal and immediate suprabasal layers of skin and across the entire stratified squamous epithelium of oral mucosa. However, increasing evidence suggests that the role of Dsg3 may involve more than just cell-cell adhesion., According to another context, To determine possible additional roles of Dsg3 during epithelial cell adhesion we used overexpression of full-length human Dsg3 cDNA, and RNAi-mediated knockdown of this molecule in various epithelial cell types. Overexpression of Dsg3 resulted in a reduced level of E-cadherin but a colocalisation with the E-cadherin-catenin complex of the adherens junctions. Concomitantly these transfected cells exhibited marked migratory capacity and the formation of filopodial protrusions. These latter events are consistent with Src activation and, indeed, Src-specific inhibition reversed these phenotypes. Moreover Dsg3 knockdown, which also reversed the decreased level of E-cadherin, partially blocked Src phosphorylation.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "are enzymatically active rho and rac small-gtpases involved in the establishment of the vacuolar membrane after toxoplasma gondii invasion of host cells?", "passage": "GTPases are the family of hydrolases that bind and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate. The large Immunity-related GTPases and the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor-6 in host cells are known to accumulate on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) of Toxoplasma gondii and play critical roles in this parasite infection, but these GTPases cannot explain the full extent of infection., According to another context, In this research, RhoA and Rac1 GTPases from the host cell were found to accumulate on the PVM regardless of the virulence of the T. gondii strains after T. gondii invasion, and this accumulation was dependent on their GTPase activity. The real-time micrography of T. gondii tachyzoites invading COS-7 cells overexpressing CFP-RhoA showed that this GTPase was recruited to the PVM at the very beginning of the invasion through the host cell membrane or from the cytosol. Host cell RhoA and Rac1 were also activated after T. gondii tachyzoites invasion, which was needed for host cell cytoskeleton reorganization to facilitate intracellular pathogens invasion. The decisive domains for the RhoA accumulation on the PVM included the GTP/Mg2+ binding site, the mDia effector interaction site, the G1 box, the G2 box and the G5 box, respectively, which were related to the binding of GTP for enzymatic activity and mDia for the regulation of microtubules. The recruited CFP-RhoA on the PVM could not be activated by epithelial growth factor (EGF) and no translocation was observed, unlike the unassociated RhoA in the host cell cytosol that migrated to the cell membrane towards the EGF activation spot. This result supported the hypothesis that the recruited RhoA or Rac1 on the PVM were in the GTP-bound active form. Wild-type RhoA or Rac1 overexpressed cells had almost the same infection rates by T. gondii as the mock-treated cells, while RhoA-N19 or Rac1-N17 transfected cells and RhoA, Rac1 or RhoA + Rac1 siRNA-treated cells showed significantly diminished infection rates compared to mock cells.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does rack1 suppress gastric tumorigenesis by stabilizing the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex?", "passage": "Dysregulation of Wnt signaling has been involved in gastric tumorigenesis by mechanisms that are not fully understood. The receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK1, GNB2L1) is involved in development of different tumor types, but its expression and function have not been investigated in gastric tumors., According to another context, We analyzed expression of RACK1 in gastric tumor samples and their matched normal tissues from 116 patients using immunohistochemistry. Effects of knockdown with small interfering RNAs or overexpression of RACK1 in gastric cancer cell lines were evaluated in cell growth and tumor xenograft. RACK1 signaling pathways were investigated in cells and zebrafish embryos using immunoblot, immunoprecipitation, microinjection, and in situ hybridization assays., According to another context, Expression of RACK1 was reduced in gastric tumor samples and correlated with depth of tumor infiltration and poor differentiation. Knockdown of RACK1 in gastric cancer cells accelerated their anchorage-independent proliferation in soft agar, whereas overexpression of RACK1 reduced their tumorigenicity in nude mice. RACK1 formed a complex with glycogen synthase kinase Gsk3\u03b2 and Axin to promote the interaction between Gsk3\u03b2 and \u03b2-catenin and thereby stabilized the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex. On stimulation of Wnt3a, RACK1 repressed Wnt signaling by inhibiting recruitment of Axin by Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2). Moreover, there was an inverse correlation between expression of RACK1 and localization of \u03b2-catenin to the cytoplasm/nucleus in human gastric tumor samples.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does alpha 1-antitrypsin inhibit human monocyte caspase-1?", "passage": "Alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is a 52 kDa serine protease inhibitor produced largely by hepatocytes but also by mononuclear phagocytes. A1AT chiefly inhibits neutrophil elastase and proteinase-3 but has also been reported to have immune modulatory functions including the ability to inhibit caspases. Its clinical availability for infusion suggests that A1AT therapy might modulate caspase related inflammation. Here we tested the ability of A1AT to modulate caspase-1 function in human mononuclear phagocytes., According to another context, Purified plasma derived A1AT was added to active caspase-1 in a cell-free system (THP-1 lysates) as well as added exogenously to cell-culture models and human whole blood models of caspase-1 activation. Functional caspase-1 activity was quantified by the cleavage of the caspase-1 specific fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate (WEHD-afc) and the release of processed IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2., According to another context, THP-1 cell lysates generated spontaneous activation of caspase-1 both by WEHD-afc cleavage and the generation of p20 caspase-1. A1AT added to this cell free system was unable to inhibit caspase-1 activity. Release of processed IL-18 by THP-1 cells was also unaffected by the addition of exogenous A1AT prior to stimulation with LPS/ATP, a standard caspase-1 activating signal. Importantly, the A1AT exhibited potent neutrophil elastase inhibitory capacity. Furthermore, A1AT complexed to NE (and hence conformationally modified) also did not affect THP-1 cell caspase-1 activation. Finally, exogenous A1AT did not inhibit the ability of human whole blood samples to process and release IL-1\u03b2.", "answer": "no"}

There have been several studies investigating characteristics of root lifespan of both woody and herbaceous species. However, most of the studies have focused on non-clonal plants, and there have been little data on root lifespan for clonal plants that occur widely in temperate grasslands., According to another context, We investigated the effects of rhizome severing on overall root lifespan of Leymus chinensis, a clonal, dominant grass species in the temperate steppe in northern China, in a 2-year field study using modified rhizotron technique. More specifically, we investigated the effects of rhizome severing on root lifespan of roots born in different seasons and distributed at different soil depths. Rhizome severing led to an increase in the overall root lifespan from 81 to 103 days. The increase in root lifespan exhibited spatial and temporal characteristics such that it increased lifespan for roots distributed in the top two soil layers and for roots born in summer and spring, but it had no effect on lifespan of roots in the deep soil layer and born in autumn. We also examined the effect of rhizome severing on carbohydrate and N contents in roots, and found that root carbohydrate and N contents were not affected by rhizome severing. Further, we found that root lifespan of Stipa krylovii and Artemisia frigida, two dominant, non-clonal species in the temperate steppe, was significantly longer (118 d) than that of L. chinensis (81 d), and this value became comparable to that of L. chinensis under rhizome severing (103 d).", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "is paradoxical sphincter contraction rarely indicative of anismus?", "passage": "Anismus is thought to be a cause of chronic constipation by producing outlet obstruction. The underlying mechanism is paradoxical contraction of the anal sphincter or puborectalis muscle. However, paradoxical sphincter contraction (PSC) also occurs in healthy controls, so anismus may be diagnosed too often because it may be based on a non-specific finding related to untoward conditions during the anorectal examination., According to another context, To investigate the pathophysiological importance of PSC found at anorectal manometry in constipated patients and in patients with stool incontinence., According to another context, Digital rectal examination and anorectal manometry were performed in 102 chronically constipated patients, 102 patients with stool incontinence, and in 18 controls without anorectal disease.

Growth and metastasis of cells overexpressing dominant-negative Smad3 (Smad3D) were studied to determine its role in tumor progression in mice. Cell growth, apoptosis, and expression of angiogenic molecules in tumor lesions were studied to determine potential pathways that Smad3 promotes tumor progression., According to another context, Smad3 was overexpressed in human prostate cancer, which correlated with Gleason score and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Androgen-independent PC-3MM2 and DU145 cells expressed much higher levels of Smad3 than did androgen-dependent LNCaP, 22Rv1, and LAPC-4 cells. Overexpression of Smad3D in PC-3MM2 cells (PC-3MM2-Smad3D) had minimal direct effects on cell growth but attenuated effects of transforming growth factor-beta1 on gene expression and cell growth. Overexpression of Smad3D did not significantly alter tumor incidence but reduced tumor growth rate and metastasis incidence. Most cells in the control tumors, but not PC-3MM2-Smad3D tumors, were positively stained by an antibody to proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

{"question": "does rapamycin-induced hypoxia inducible factor 2a be essential for chondrogenic differentiation of amniotic fluid stem cells?", "passage": "Amniotic fluid stem (AFS) cells represent a major source of donor cells for cartilage repair. Recently, it became clear that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition has beneficial effects on cartilage homeostasis, but the effect of mTOR on chondrogenic differentiation is still elusive. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) modulation on the expression of SOX9 and on its downstream targets during chondrogenic differentiation of AFS cells. We performed three-dimensional pellet culturing of AFS cells and of in vitro-expanded, human-derived chondrocytes in the presence of chondrogenic factors. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or by small interfering RNA-mediated targeting of raptor (gene name, RPTOR) led to increased AKT activation, upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 2A, and an increase in SOX9, COL2A1, and ACAN abundance. Here we show that HIF2A expression is essential for chondrogenic differentiation and that AKT activity regulates HIF2A amounts. Importantly, engraftment of AFS cells in cell pellets composed of human chondrocytes revealed an advantage of raptor knockdown cells compared with control cells in their ability to express SOX9. Our results demonstrate that mTORC1 inhibition leads to AKT activation and an increase in HIF2A expression. Therefore, we suggest that mTORC1 inhibition is a powerful tool for enhancing chondrogenic differentiation of AFS cells and also of in vitro-expanded adult chondrocytes before transplantation.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does previous heat shock facilitate the glutamine-induced expression of heat-shock protein 72 in septic liver?", "passage": "This study investigated the effects of glutamine administration on the expression of the heat-shock protein 72 (Hsp72) in the liver during sepsis. The role of heat-shock factor 1 (HSF-1) was analyzed for possible mechanisms to the phenomenon., According to another context, Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Heat-shock treatment was applied to the rats' whole body using an electric heating pad 24 h before CLP. Glutamine or saline was administered 1 h after initiation of sepsis by tail vein injection. The Hsp72 and HSF-1 expressions were detected using western blot analysis, and Hsp72 mRNA expression was measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction., According to another context, The Hsp72 content noticeably increased in the livers of preheated rats supplied by glutamine 1 h after sepsis. However, no further synthesis of Hsp72 was found in septic livers or sham glutamine-treated livers. Hsp72, which was induced by preheating, decreased with time, whereas a large amount of Hsp72 could be detected by glutamine administration. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction data indicated that Hsp72 mRNA could be detected only in the group treated with preheating and glutamine administration. The translocation of HSF-1 occurred significantly during sepsis in preheated and non-preheated rats. However, only the preheated group showed the phosphorylation in HSF-1. With the administration of glutamine, the nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated HSF-1 was observed to decline significantly 9 and 18 h after CLP when the Hsp72 mRNA became detectable.", "answer": "yes"}

We investigated the effect of germline variation in the promoter region of the PTEN gene on clinical characteristics and survival in breast cancer., According to another context, We screened the promoter region of the PTEN gene for germline variation in 330 familial breast cancer cases and further determined the genotypes of three detected PTEN promoter polymorphisms -903GA, -975GC, and -1026CA in a total of 2,412 breast cancer patients to evaluate the effects of the variants on tumor characteristics and disease outcome. We compared the gene expression profiles in breast cancers of 10 variant carriers and 10 matched non-carriers and performed further survival analyses based on the differentially expressed genes., According to another context, All three promoter variants associated with worse prognosis. The Cox's regression hazard ratio for 10-year breast cancer specific survival in multivariate analysis was 2.01 (95% CI 1.17 to 3.46) P = 0.0119, and for 5-year breast cancer death or distant metastasis free survival 1.79 (95% CI 1.03 to 3.11) P = 0.0381 for the variant carriers, indicating PTEN promoter variants as an independent prognostic factor. The breast tumors from the promoter variant carriers exhibited a similar gene expression signature of 160 differentially expressed genes compared to matched non-carrier tumors. The signature further stratified patients into two groups with different recurrence free survival in independent breast cancer gene expression data sets.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "is the osteogenic or adipogenic lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells determined by protein kinase c delta?", "passage": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to differentiate into specialized cell lineages such as osteoblasts and adipocytes in vitro. There exists a reciprocal relationship between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs that an osteogenic phenotype occurs at the expense of an adipogenic phenotype and vice versa, which in turn influence one another's phenotype through negative feedback loops. Thus, it is important to understand what signaling molecules modulate the lineage commitment of MSCs. Protein kinase C (PKC) plays a central role in cellular signal transduction for mediating diverse biological functions, and dysregulation of PKC activity is involved in various metabolic diseases including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Although the role of individual PKC isoforms has been investigated in various fields, the potential role of PKC in bone metabolism is not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the potential role of PKC\u03b4 in osteogenic lineage commitment of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs)., According to another context, We observed that expression and phosphorylation of PKC\u03b4 were increased during osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of PKC\u03b4 in hBMSCs resulted in a significant attenuation of osteogenic differentiation as evidenced by reduced ALP activity and ECM mineralization, as well as down-regulation of the expression of osteoblast-specific genes. These effects were also accompanied by induction of adipogenic differentiation and up-regulation of the expression of adipocyte-specific genes involved in lipid synthesis in osteogenic induction of hBMSCs. Additionally, the activation of AMPK, which is a key cellular energy sensor, induced osteogenesis of hBMSCs. However, the inhibition of AMPK activity by compound C did not affect the activation of PKC\u03b4 at all, indicating that there is no direct correlation between AMPK and PKC\u03b4 in osteogenesis of hBMSCs.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does cryopreservation of mononuclear cells before extracorporeal photochemotherapy impair their anti-proliferative capabilities?", "passage": "The clinical benefits of extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) are well recognized, but its clinical use is limited by logistical difficulties, especially because of the need to perform repeated aphereses. The cryopreservation of mononuclear cells could allow maintenance of the ECP schedule while reducing the number of aphereses. The aim of this work was to assess whether previous cryopreservation impairs the immunomodulatory function of ECP-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)., According to another context, Fresh or previously cryopreserved PBMC were exposed to ECP and added on day 0 into a mixed leukocyte reaction. Proliferation of alloreactive lymphocytes was measured by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dye dilution. Apoptosis was quantified by annexin-7AAD staining., According to another context, ECP-induced apoptosis was slightly increased in cryopreserved cells but the kinetics of apoptosis were similar to fresh cells. Lymphocytes stimulated in the presence of ECP-treated PBMC displayed a significant decrease in proliferation.

{"question": "does blockade of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels eliminate isoflurane-induced coronary artery vasodilation?", "passage": "The mechanisms by which volatile anesthetics induce vasodilation are unknown. Recent studies of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels (KATP channels) in the vascular smooth muscle of the coronary circulation suggest that these channels play a role in the coronary artery dilation produced by hypoxemia, the coronary blood flow (CBF) reactive hyperemic response, and in CBF auto regulation. We therefore conducted this study to determine the role of KATP channels in isoflurane-induced coronary vasodilation., According to another context, Studies were conducted in six open-chest, anesthetized swine. The left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated and perfused by blood passed through a membrane oxygenator. This preparation allowed us to administer drugs and volatile anesthetics regionally to the perfused myocardium, minimizing systemic effects. Regional CBF response to 1.5% and 3.0% isoflurane administered via the membrane oxygenator was measured before and after blockade of KATP channels, and was compared to the vasodilation produced by regional administration of several doses of sodium nitroprusside and adenosine. Blockade of KATP channels was achieved by regional intracoronary administration of glibenclamide (1-22 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), a specific blocker of these channels., According to another context, Administration of 1.5 and 3.0 percent isoflurane increased regional CBF by 29 +/- 29% and by 62 +/- 28%, respectively. Under control conditions, blockade of KATP channels decreased mean CBF by 18%, but did not cause ischemia. KATP channel blockade totally eliminated the vasodilator response to both doses of isoflurane. During KATP channel blockade the response to 3% isoflurane was converted to net vasoconstriction: mean delta CBF = -5% +/- 6%, P = < 0.05 versus control. Negative inotropic effects of isoflurane were not eliminated by glibenclamide. Because KATP channel blockade was so effective in eliminating isoflurane-induced coronary vasodilation, the dose of glibenclamide was decreased in sequential experiments, but total blockade of isoflurane vasodilation was achieved even at the smallest dose of glibenclamide studied (1 microgram.kg-1.min-1). The vasodilator response to nitroprusside was not affected, and the vasodilator response to adenosine was partially inhibited (consistent with their known mechanisms of action).", "answer": "yes"}

DNA sequence analysis was then performed to screen for polymorphism in Crhr2 in order to identify genetic variation, and luciferase reporter assays were then applied to test their functional significance. Next, binding assays were used to determine whether this polymorphism affected CRF2 receptor binding affinity as well as CRF2 receptor density in the CNS. Finally, social interaction and corticosterone levels were measured in the P and NP rats before and after 30-minute restraint stress., According to another context, Crhr2 mRNA expression studies found lower levels of Crhr2 mRNA in iP rats compared to iNP rats. In addition, DNA sequencing identified polymorphisms in the promoter region, coding region, and 3'-untranslated region between the iP and iNP rats. A 7 bp insertion in the Crhr2 promoter of iP rats altered expression in vitro as measured by reporter assays, and we found that CRF2 receptor density was lower in the amygdala of iP as compared to iNP rats.

{"question": "do dopamine d2 receptors mediate two-odor discrimination and reversal learning in c57bl/6 mice?", "passage": "Dopamine modulation of neuronal signaling in the frontal cortex, midbrain, and striatum is essential for processing and integrating diverse external sensory stimuli and attaching salience to environmental cues that signal causal relationships, thereby guiding goal-directed, adaptable behaviors. At the cellular level, dopamine signaling is mediated through D1-like or D2-like receptors. Although a role for D1-like receptors in a variety of goal-directed behaviors has been identified, an explicit involvement of D2 receptors has not been clearly established. To determine whether dopamine D2 receptor-mediated signaling contributes to associative and reversal learning, we compared C57Bl/6J mice that completely lack functional dopamine D2 receptors to wild-type mice with respect to their ability to attach appropriate salience to external stimuli (stimulus discrimination) and disengage from inappropriate behavioral strategies when reinforcement contingencies change (e.g. reversal learning)., According to another context, Mildly food-deprived female wild-type and dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice rapidly learned to retrieve and consume visible food reinforcers from a small plastic dish. Furthermore, both genotypes readily learned to dig through the same dish filled with sterile sand in order to locate a buried food pellet. However, the dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice required significantly more trials than wild-type mice to discriminate between two dishes, each filled with a different scented sand, and to associate one of the two odors with the presence of a reinforcer (food). In addition, the dopamine D2 receptor deficient mice repeatedly fail to alter their response patterns during reversal trials where the reinforcement rules were inverted.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "are sulphate and chloride-dependent potassium transport in human erythrocytes affected by crude venom from nematocysts of the jellyfish pelagia noctiluca?", "passage": "It has been reported that biologically active compounds extracted from Cnidaria venom may induce damage by oxidative stress. Erythrocytes are constantly exposed to oxidative stresses, which can contribute to sulphydril (SH-) group oxidation and cell membrane deformability accompanied with activation of K-Cl co-transport and inhibition of anion transport. In this regard, Band 3 protein is responsible for mediating the electroneutral exchange of chloride (Cl(-)) for bicarbonate (HCO3(-)), particularly in erythrocytes, where it is the most abundant membrane protein. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of crude venom extracted from Pelagia noctiluca nematocysts on Band 3 -mediated anion transport in human erythrocytes., According to another context, Erythrocytes were tested for SO4(2-) uptake, K(+) efflux, glutathione (GSH) levels and concentration of SH- groups., According to another context, The rate constant of SO4(2-) uptake decreased progressively to 58% of control with increasing venom doses, and showed a 28% decrease after 2 mM NEM treatment. These effects can be explained by oxidative stress, which was reflected by decreased GSH levels in venom-treated erythrocytes. Hence, the decreased efficiency of anion transport may be due to changes in Band 3 structure caused by SH-group oxidation and reduced GSH concentration. In addition, an increased Cl(-)-dependent K(+) efflux was observed in venom-treated erythrocytes.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "do growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-i therapy promote protein deposition and growth in dexamethasone-treated piglets?", "passage": "Dexamethasone treatment facilitates the weaning of premature infants from mechanical ventilation but impairs protein homeostasis, lean tissue deposition, and growth. The current study was conducted to investigate whether dexamethasone mediates these effects by reducing protein synthesis or elevating protein breakdown, and whether adjuvant growth hormone+/-insulin-like growth factor-I therapy can attenuate such effects., According to another context, Piglets (n = 24) were randomized to placebo, a tapered course of dexamethasone (0.5, 0.3, 0.2 mg/kg per day for 5, 5 and 4 days each, respectively), dexamethasone + growth hormone 0.1 mg/kg per day, or dexamethasone + growth hormone + insulin-like growth factor-I 0.1 mg/kg per day for 14 days. On day 13, 15N-glycine was administered as a single oral dose, and urine was collected at timed intervals during the subsequent 48 hours., According to another context, Total urinary N and cumulative 15N excretion were higher in all dexamethasone groups than in control subjects. Protein synthesis was suppressed, whereas protein breakdown was unaltered by dexamethasone. Adjunctive growth hormone+/-insulin-like growth factor-I therapy enhanced protein synthesis, but only combined therapy improved net protein gain compared with dexamethasone alone. Higher circulating insulin-like growth factor-I may have mediated the greater net protein gain. Blood urea nitrogen was elevated in all dexamethasone-treated groups at days 6 and 11 but was normalized by day 15 with adjunctive growth hormone+/-insulin-like growth factor-I. From a functional perspective, both adjunctive growth hormone and growth hormone+/-insulin-like growth factor-I partially attenuated the dexamethasone-induced reduction in weight and length gain but not in whole body lean and fat mass.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "is modulation of inflammatory response by pentoxifylline independent of heme oxygenase-1 pathway?", "passage": "It was reported that some effects of pentoxifylline (PTX) are mediated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction. We investigated the role of HO-1 in anti-inflammatory activity of PTX., According to another context, Experiments were performed in human and murine monocytes and endothelial cells and in HO-1 deficient mice., According to another context, PTX dose-dependently decreased expression of HO-1 in cell lines studied. As expected, PTX reduced also production of TNF. This effect was independent of HO-1 activity, as demonstrated in cells treated with HO-1 activators and inhibitors or in cells overexpressing HO-1. Moreover, inhibition of TNF was the same in human endothelial cells of different HO-1 genotypes, showing that PTX is similarly efficient in carriers of more and less active HO-1 promoter variants. In mice, PTX did not influence HO-1 expression, as measured in liver, kidney, spleen, heart, and skin. Accordingly, the response of PTX treated animals to LPS was the same in wild type and HO-1 deficient mice.

{"question": "does hedgehog promote neovascularization in pancreatic cancers by regulating ang-1 and igf-1 expression in bone-marrow derived pro-angiogenic cells?", "passage": "The hedgehog (Hh) pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Recent studies have suggested that the oncogenic function of Hh in PDAC involves signaling in the stromal cells rather than cell autonomous effects on the tumor cells. However, the origin and nature of the stromal cell type(s) that are responsive to Hh signaling remained unknown. Since Hh signaling plays a crucial role during embryonic and postnatal vasculogenesis, we speculated that Hh ligand may act on tumor vasculature specifically focusing on bone marrow (BM)-derived cells., According to another context, Cyclopamine was utilized to inhibit the Hh pathway in human PDAC cell lines and their xenografts. BM transplants, co-culture systems of tumor cells and BM-derived pro-angiogenic cells (BMPCs) were employed to assess the role of tumor-derived Hh in regulating the BM compartment and the contribution of BM-derived cells to angiogenesis in PDAC. Cyclopamine administration attenuated Hh signaling in the stroma rather than in the cancer cells as reflected by decreased expression of full length Gli2 protein and Gli1 mRNA specifically in the compartment. Cyclopamine inhibited the growth of PDAC xenografts in association with regression of the tumor vasculature and reduced homing of BM-derived cells to the tumor. Host-derived Ang-1 and IGF-1 mRNA levels were downregulated by cyclopamine in the tumor xenografts. In vitro co-culture and matrigel plug assays demonstrated that PDAC cell-derived Shh induced Ang-1 and IGF-1 production in BMPCs, resulting in their enhanced migration and capillary morphogenesis activity.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "does rapid pikk-dependent release of chk1 from chromatin promote the dna-damage checkpoint response?", "passage": "Checkpoint signaling pathways are of crucial importance for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Within these pathways, the effector kinase Chk1 plays a central role in mediating cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage, and it does so by phosphorylating key cell-cycle regulators., According to another context, By investigating the subcellular distribution of Chk1 by cell fractionation, we observed that around 20% of it localizes to chromatin during all phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, we found that in response to DNA damage, Chk1 rapidly dissociates from the chromatin. Significantly, we observed a tight correlation between DNA-damage-induced Chk1 phosphorylation and chromatin dissociation, suggesting that phosphorylated Chk1 does not stably associate with chromatin. Consistent with these events being triggered by active checkpoint signaling, inhibition of the DNA-damage-activated kinases ATR and ATM, or siRNA-mediated downregulation of the DNA-damage mediator proteins Claspin and TopBP1, impaired DNA-damage-induced dissociation of Chk1 from chromatin. Finally, we established that Chk1 phosphorylation occurs at localized sites of DNA damage and that constitutive immobilization of Chk1 on chromatin results in a defective DNA-damage-induced checkpoint arrest.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "does the rapamycin-regulated gene expression signature determine prognosis for breast cancer?", "passage": "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in multiple intracellular signaling pathways promoting tumor growth. mTOR is aberrantly activated in a significant portion of breast cancers and is a promising target for treatment.

{"question": "does chronic inhibition of cgmp-specific phosphodiesterase 5 suppress endoplasmic reticulum stress in heart failure?", "passage": "Inhibition of the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) exerts profound beneficial effects on failing hearts. However, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of PDE5 inhibition on heart failure are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether PDE5 inhibition decreases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key event in heart failure., According to another context, Heart failure was induced by isoprenaline s.c. injection in Sprague-Dawley rats and transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice. PDE5 was inhibited with sildenafil. Heart function was detected by invasive pressure-volume analysis and echocardiography. ER stress markers were analysed by Western blotting. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric analysis., According to another context, PDE5 inhibition markedly attenuated isoprenaline-induced and TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, and reduced ER stress and apoptosis. Further, PDE5 inhibition with sildenafil largely prevented ER stress and reduced apoptosis in isoprenaline- or thapsigargin-treated cardiomyocytes. PKG inhibition markedly prevented the protective effects of sildenafil in vivo and in vitro. To further understand the mechanism of the effect of PDE5 inhibition on ER stress, we demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitor increased sarco-(endo)-plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) -ATPase activity via phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser(16) . This may contribute to the attenuation of ER stress induced by PDE5 inhibition.", "answer": "yes"}

In the present study, we sought to determine the fibrogenic downstream events set in motion by such signaling., According to another context, Experimental colitis with late-onset intestinal fibrosis was induced by weekly intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to BALB/c mice. Blockade of IL-13 signaling via IL-13R alpha(2) and TGF-beta1 signaling was achieved by the administration of small interfering RNA or decoy oligonucleotides that target promoter sequences of signaling components of these receptors. Effects of blockade were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blotting detecting specific key fibrogenic factors and by measurement of collagen production., According to another context, Initially, we showed that abrogation of IL-13 activity via blockade of IL-13R alpha(2) and TGF-beta1 signaling results in severe inhibition of expression of colonic insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and early growth response gene (Egr)-1, factors known to initiate and sustain fibrosis. We then showed that Egr-1 was necessary early in the fibrotic process for caspase-mediated apoptosis of myofibroblasts and the production of urokinase plasminogen activator, a protein that enhances TGF-beta1 activation. Finally, we showed that IGF-I (together with TGF-beta1) acts later in the process to stimulate myofibroblasts to deposit collagen in the colon.", "answer": "yes"}

Subjects consumed each treatment for three weeks in a crossover design. Plasma, collected weekly was analyzed for total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride concentrations and for the antioxidant biomarkers of malondialdehyde formation products (MDA), plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP). Data were analyzed using Proc Mixed Procedure and associations between antioxidant and lipid measures were identified by Pearson's product moment correlation analysis., According to another context, Compared to the control diet, the lycopene-containing foods did not affect plasma lipid concentrations or antioxidant biomarkers. Women had higher total cholesterol, HDL-C and triglyceride concentrations than did the men. Total cholesterol was positively correlated to MDA and FRAP while HDL-C was positively correlated to MDA and GPX. GPX was negatively correlated to triglyceride concentration.", "answer": "no"}
{"question": "do articular surface segmentation using active shape models for intraoperative implant assessment?", "passage": "In orthopedic surgeries, it is important to avoid intra-articular implant placements, which increase revision rates and the risk of arthritis. In order to support the intraoperative assessment and correction of surgical implants, we present an automatic detection approach using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)., According to another context, Multiple active shape models (ASM) with specified articular surface regions are used to isolate the joint spaces. Fast and easy-to-implement methods are integrated in the ASM segmentation to optimize the robustness and accuracy for intraoperative application. A cylinder detection method is applied to determine metal implants. Intersections between articular surfaces and cylinders are detected and used to find intra-articular collisions., According to another context, Segmentations of two calcaneal articular surfaces were evaluated on 50 patient images and have shown average surface distance errors of 0.59 and 0.46\u00a0mm, respectively. The proposed model-independent segmentation at the specified articular surface regions allowed to significantly decrease the error by 22 and 25\u00a0% on average. The method was able to compensate suboptimal initializations for translations of up to 16\u00a0mm and rotations of up to 21[Formula: see text].

{"question": "does vitamin d deficiency exacerbate copd-like characteristics in the lungs of cigarette smoke-exposed mice?", "passage": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by excessive inflammation and disturbed bacterial clearance in the airways. Although cigarette smoke (CS) exposure poses a major risk, vitamin D deficiency could potentially contribute to COPD progression. Many in vitro studies demonstrate important anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of vitamin D, but a direct contribution of vitamin D deficiency to COPD onset and disease progression has not been explored., According to another context, In the current study, we used a murine experimental model to investigate the combined effect of vitamin D deficiency and CS exposure on the development of COPD-like characteristics. Therefore, vitamin D deficient or control mice were exposed to CS or ambient air for a period of 6 (subacute) or 12 weeks (chronic). Besides lung function and structure measurements, we performed an in depth analysis of the size and composition of the cellular infiltrate in the airways and lung parenchyma and tested the ex vivo phagocytic and oxidative burst capacity of alveolar macrophages., According to another context, Vitamin D deficient mice exhibited an accelerated lung function decline following CS exposure compared to control mice. Furthermore, early signs of emphysema were only observed in CS-exposed vitamin D deficient mice, which was accompanied by elevated levels of MMP-12 in the lung. Vitamin D deficient mice showed exacerbated infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airways and lung parenchyma after both subacute and chronic CS exposure compared to control mice. Furthermore, elevated levels of typical proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines could be detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (KC and TNF-\u03b1) and lung tissue (IP-10, MCP-1, IL-12) of CS-exposed vitamin D deficient mice compared to control mice. Finally, although CS greatly impaired the ex vivo phagocytic and oxidative burst function of alveolar macrophages, vitamin D deficient mice did not feature an additional defect.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "do l-type cav1.3 channels regulate ryanodine receptor-dependent ca2+ release during sino-atrial node pacemaker activity?", "passage": "Sino-atrial node (SAN) automaticity is an essential mechanism of heart rate generation that is still not completely understood. Recent studies highlighted the importance of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) dynamics during SAN pacemaker activity. Nevertheless, the functional role of voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channels in controlling SAN [Ca(2+)]i release is largely unexplored. Since Cav1.3 is the predominant L-type Ca(2+) channel isoform in SAN cells, we studied [Ca(2+)]i dynamics in isolated cells and ex vivo SAN preparations explanted from wild-type (WT) and Cav1.3 knockout (KO) mice (Cav1.3(-/-))., According to another context, We found that Cav1.3 deficiency strongly impaired [Ca(2+)]i dynamics, reducing the frequency of local [Ca(2+)]i release events and preventing their synchronization. This impairment inhibited the generation of Ca(2+) transients and delayed spontaneous activity. We also used action potentials recorded in WT SAN cells as voltage-clamp commands for Cav1.3(-/-) cells. Although these experiments showed abolished Ca(2+) entry through L-type Ca(2+) channels in the diastolic depolarization range of KO SAN cells, their sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load remained normal. \u03b2-Adrenergic stimulation enhanced pacemaking of both genotypes, though, Cav1.3(-/-) SAN cells remained slower than WT. Conversely, we rescued pacemaker activity in Cav1.3(-/-) SAN cells and intact tissues through caffeine-mediated stimulation of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release.", "answer": "yes"}

However, the molecular pathogenesis of PH is still poorly understood. In developing fetal lungs, fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF-18) plays a crucial role in distal airway maturation. FGF-18 knockouts show smaller lung sizes with reduced alveolar spaces and thicker interstitial mesenchymal compartments, highlighting its important function for fetal lung growth and differentiation. We hypothesized that pulmonary FGF-18 gene expression is downregulated during late gestation in nitrofen-induced hypoplastic lungs., According to another context, Pregnant rats were exposed to either olive oil or nitrofen on day 9 of gestation (D9). Fetuses were harvested on D18 and D21, and lungs were divided into three groups: controls, hypoplastic lungs without CDH [CDH(-)], and hypoplastic lungs with CDH [CDH(+)] (n = 24 at each time-point). Pulmonary FGF-18 gene expression levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate FGF-18 protein expression/distribution., According to another context, Relative mRNA levels of pulmonary FGF-18 gene expression were significantly decreased in CDH(-) and CDH(+) on D18 and D21 compared to controls (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively).

Reduction of LV mass may be a desirable goal of drug therapy for hypertension. However, although thiazide diuretic drugs have been advocated as first-line therapy for hypertension, their efficacy in reducing LV mass has been questioned., According to another context, Patients with mild to moderate diastolic hypertension and LV mass in excess of 1 SD of normal values were randomized to isradipine (n = 89) or hydrochlorothiazide therapy (n = 45). Evaluations were obtained at baseline, after 3 and 6 months of treatment and 2 weeks after treatment was stopped., According to another context, At 6 months, LV mass decreased by 43 +/- 45 g (mean +/- SD) with hydrochlorothiazide (p < 0.001) but only by 11 +/- 48 g with isradipine (p = NS; between-group comparison, p < 0.001). Two weeks after drug therapy was stopped, LV mass remained 24 +/- 41 g lower than that at baseline in the hydrochlorothiazide group (p = 0.003) but only 7 +/- 50 g lower in the isradipine group (p = NS). Septal and posterior wall thicknesses were significantly and equally reduced with both isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Greater LV mass reduction with hydrochlorothiazide was related to a 2.8 +/- 3.3-mm reduction of LV cavity size with hydrochlorothiazide but no reduction with isradipine. At 6 months of treatment, diastolic blood pressure (BP) by design was equally reduced in both treatment groups. At 3 months, systolic BP was reduced by 17 +/- 15 mm Hg with isradipine and by 26 +/- 15 and 25 +/- 17 mm Hg at 3 and 6 months, respectively, with hydrochlorothiazide (p = 0.003, between-group comparison).

In the present study we investigated the effects of paracrine factors derived from cultured endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) on rat brain endothelial cell properties and addressed the signaling pathways involved., According to another context, Endothelial cells derived from rat brain (rBCEC4) were incubated with EPC-derived conditioned medium (EPC-CM). The angiogenic response of rBCEC4 to EPC-CM was assessed as effect on cell number, migration and tubular network formation. In addition, we have compared the outcome of the in vitro experiments with the effects on capillary sprouting from rat aortic rings. The specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98059 were used to study the involvement of these two signaling pathways in the transduction of the angiogenic effects of EPC-CM., According to another context, Viable cell number, migration and tubule network formation were significantly augmented upon incubation with EPC-CM. Similar findings were observed for aortic ring outgrowth with significantly longer sprouts. The EPC-CM-induced activities were significantly reduced by the blockage of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways.

{"question": "does panel of emerging cardiac biomarkers contribute for prognosis rather than diagnosis in chronic heart failure?", "passage": "As complex disease, heart failure is associated with various pathophysiological and biochemical disorders. No single biomarker is able to display all these characteristics. Therefore, we evaluated a multimarker panel together with the biochemical gold-standard NT-proBNP. Part of the panel are markers for angiogenesis (Endostatin, IBP-4, IBP-7, sFlt-1 as antiangiogenetic factors and PLGF as angiogenectic factor), myocyte stress (GDF-15), extracellular matrix remodelling (galectin-3, mimecan and TIMP-1), inflammation (galectin-3) and myocyte injury (hs-TnT)., According to another context, All markers (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) were assessed in a cohort of 149 patients with chronic heart failure and 84 healthy controls., According to another context, All markers were positively correlated with ln NT-proBNP (each p < 0.05).

{"question": "does coinhibitory suppression of t cell activation by cd40 protect against obesity and adipose tissue inflammation in mice?", "passage": "Costimulatory cascades such as the CD40L-CD40 dyad enhance immune cell activation and inflammation during atherosclerosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that CD40 directly modulates traits of the metabolic syndrome in diet-induced obesity in mice., According to another context, To induce the metabolic syndrome, wild-type or CD40(-/-) mice consumed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks. Unexpectedly, CD40(-/-) mice exhibited increased weight gain, impaired insulin secretion, augmented accumulation of inflammatory cells in adipose tissue, and enhanced proinflammatory gene expression. This proinflammatory and adverse metabolic phenotype could be transplanted into wild-type mice by reconstitution with CD40-deficient lymphocytes, indicating a major role for CD40 in T or B cells in this context. Conversely, therapeutic activation of CD40 signaling by the stimulating antibody FGK45 abolished further weight gain during the study, lowered glucose levels, improved insulin sensitivity, and suppressed adipose tissue inflammation. Mechanistically, CD40 activation decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in T cells but not in B cells or macrophages. Finally, repopulation of lymphocyte-free Rag1(-/-) mice with CD40(-/-) T cells provoked dysmetabolism and inflammation, corroborating a protective role of CD40 on T cells in the metabolic syndrome.

{"question": "does a transient breach in the epithelial barrier lead to regulatory t-cell generation and resistance to experimental colitis?", "passage": "Previous studies have indicated that a defective epithelial barrier leads to inflammation of the underlying lamina propria. Nevertheless, it is likely that physiologic breaks in the barrier must occur for homeostatic regulatory T cells to develop. We determined the effect of agents that disrupt epithelial tight junctions (ethanol and AT1002, a Vibrio cholerae zonula occludens toxin hexapeptide) on regulatory T-cell induction and resistance to induction of colitis by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)., According to another context, The effects of ethanol and AT1002 on colon immune function were evaluated by their capacity to induce direct phenotypic or functional changes in effector and regulatory cell populations and their indirect effect on the development of TNBS-induced colitis. The basis of regulatory cell development was evaluated with in vitro studies of isolated dendritic cell populations. The role of innate immunity was evaluated by in vivo gene silencing studies utilizing Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA)., According to another context, Both ethanol and AT1002 induced persistent latency-associated peptide-positive CD4(+) regulatory T cells that, as shown in adoptive transfer studies, render mice resistant to the induction of TNBS colitis. The development of these cells requires the presence of an intact microflora and the activity of CD11c(+) dendritic cells. Their induction is also influenced by innate immune factors operating through TLR-2, because attenuation of TLR-2 signaling by in vivo TLR-2 siRNA administration prevents their development.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "does human apolipoprotein a-i gene transfer reduce the development of experimental diabetic cardiomyopathy?", "passage": "The hallmarks of diabetic cardiomyopathy are cardiac oxidative stress, intramyocardial inflammation, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac apoptosis. Given the antioxidative, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic potential of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), we evaluated the hypothesis that increased HDL via gene transfer (GT) with human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, the principal apolipoprotein of HDL, may reduce the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy., According to another context, Intravenous GT with 3x10(12) particles/kg of the E1E3E4-deleted vector Ad.hapoA-I, expressing human apoA-I, or Ad.Null, containing no expression cassette, was performed 5 days after streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Six weeks after apoA-I GT, HDL cholesterol levels were increased by 1.6-fold (P<0.001) compared with diabetic controls injected with the Ad.Null vector (STZ-Ad.Null). ApoA-I GT and HDL improved LV contractility in vivo and cardiomyocyte contractility ex vivo, respectively.

{"question": "does modulation of the human gut microbiota by dietary fibres occur at the species level?", "passage": "Dietary intake of specific non-digestible carbohydrates (including prebiotics) is increasingly seen as a highly effective approach for manipulating the composition and activities of the human gut microbiota to benefit health. Nevertheless, surprisingly little is known about the global response of the microbial community to particular carbohydrates. Recent in vivo dietary studies have demonstrated that the species composition of the human faecal microbiota is influenced by dietary intake. There is now potential to gain insights into the mechanisms involved by using in vitro systems that produce highly controlled conditions of pH and substrate supply., According to another context, We supplied two alternative non-digestible polysaccharides as energy sources to three different human gut microbial communities in anaerobic, pH-controlled continuous-flow fermentors. Community analysis showed that supply of apple pectin or inulin resulted in the highly specific enrichment of particular bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs; based on 16S rRNA gene sequences). Of the eight most abundant Bacteroides OTUs detected, two were promoted specifically by inulin and six by pectin. Among the Firmicutes, Eubacterium eligens in particular was strongly promoted by pectin, while several species were stimulated by inulin. Responses were influenced by pH, which was stepped up, and down, between 5.5, 6.0, 6.4 and 6.9 in parallel vessels within each experiment. In particular, several experiments involving downshifts to pH 5.5 resulted in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii replacing Bacteroides spp. as the dominant sequences observed. Community diversity was greater in the pectin-fed than in the inulin-fed fermentors, presumably reflecting the differing complexity of the two substrates.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does comprehensive computational pathological image analysis predict lung cancer prognosis?", "passage": "Pathological examination of histopathological slides is a routine clinical procedure for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Although the classification of lung cancer has been updated to become more specific, only a small subset of the total morphological features is taken into consideration. The vast majority of the detailed morphological features of tumor tissues, particularly tumor cells' surrounding microenvironment, are not fully analyzed. The heterogeneity of tumor cells and close interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironments are closely related to tumor development and progression. The goal of this study is to develop morphological feature-based prediction models for the prognosis of lung cancer patients., According to another context, We developed objective and quantitative computational approaches to analyze the morphological features of pathological images for non-small cell lung cancer patients. Tissue pathological images were analyzed for 523 adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 511 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung cancer cohorts. The features extracted from the pathological images were used to develop statistical models that predict patients' survival outcomes in ADC and SCC, respectively., According to another context, We extracted 943 morphological features from tissue hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) pathological images and identified morphological features that are significantly associated with prognosis in ADC and SCC, respectively. Statistical models based on these extracted features stratified NSCLC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The models were developed from training sets and validated in independent testing sets: predicted high-risk group vs low-risk group, HR = 2.34 (1.12-4.91), p=0.024 for ADC patients and HR = 2.22 (1.15-4.27), p=0.017 for SCC patients, after adjusting for age, gender, smoking status and pathologic tumor stage.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "is the g protein-coupled receptor subset of the dog genome more similar to that in humans than rodents?", "passage": "The dog is an important model organism and it is considered to be closer to humans than rodents regarding metabolism and responses to drugs. The close relationship between humans and dogs over many centuries has lead to the diversity of the canine species, important genetic discoveries and an appreciation of the effects of old age in another species. The superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is one of the largest gene families in most mammals and the most exploited in terms of drug discovery. An accurate comparison of the GPCR repertoires in dog and human is valuable for the prediction of functional similarities and differences between the species., According to another context, We searched the dog genome for non-olfactory GPCRs and obtained 353 full-length GPCR gene sequences, 18 incomplete sequences and 13 pseudogenes. We established relationships between human, dog, rat and mouse GPCRs resolving orthologous pairs and species-specific duplicates. We found that 12 dog GPCR genes are missing in humans while 24 human GPCR genes are not part of the dog GPCR repertoire. There is a higher number of orthologous pairs between dog and human that are conserved as compared with either mouse or rat. In almost all cases the differences observed between the dog and human genomes coincide with other variations in the rodent species.

{"question": "does interatrial septum motion but not doppler assessment predict elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients undergoing cardiac surgery?", "passage": "Left atrial pressure and its surrogate, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), are important for determining diastolic function. The role of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in assessing diastolic function is well established in awake subjects. The objective was to assess the accuracy of predicting PCWP by TTE and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during coronary artery surgery., According to another context, In 27 adult patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery surgery, simultaneous echocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements were obtained immediately before anesthesia (TTE), after anesthesia and mechanical ventilation (TTE and TEE), during conduit harvest (TEE), and after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (TEE)., According to another context, Twenty patients had an ejection fraction (EF) of 0.5 or greater. With the exception of E/e' and S/D ratios, echocardiographic values changed over the echocardiographic studies. In patients with low EF, E velocity, deceleration time, pulmonary vein D, S/D, and E/e' ratios correlated well with PCWP before anesthesia. After induction of anesthesia using TTE or TEE, correlations were poor. In normal EF patients, correlations were poor for both TEE and TTE at all five stages. The sensitivity and specificity of echocardiographic values were not high enough to predict raised PCWP except for a fixed curve pattern of interatrial septum (area under the curve 0.89 for PCWP \u2265 17, and 0.98 for \u2265 18 mmHg) and S/D less than 1 (area under the curve 0.74 for PCWP \u2265 17, and 0.78 for \u2265 18 mmHg).", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does differential proteomics reveal the hallmarks of seed development in common bean ( phaseolus vulgaris l. )?", "passage": "Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the most consumed staple foods worldwide. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling seed development. This study aims to comprehensively describe proteome dynamics during seed development of common bean. A high-throughput gel-free proteomics approach (LC-MS/MS) was conducted on seeds at 10, 20, 30 and 40days after anthesis, spanning from late embryogenesis until desiccation. Of the 418 differentially accumulated proteins identified, 255 were characterized, most belonging to protein metabolism. An accumulation of proteins belonging to the MapMan functional categories of \"protein\", \"glycolysis\", \"TCA\", \"DNA\", \"RNA\", \"cell\" and \"stress\" were found at early seed development stages, reflecting an extensive metabolic activity. In the mid stages, accumulation of storage, signaling, starch synthesis and cell wall-related proteins stood out. In the later stages, an increase in proteins related to redox, protein degradation/modification/folding and nucleic acid metabolisms reflect that seed desiccation-resistance mechanisms were activated. Our study unveils new clues to understand the regulation of seed development mediated by post-translational modifications and maintenance of genome integrity. This knowledge enhances the understanding on seed development molecular mechanisms that may be used in the design and selection of common bean seeds with desired quality traits.", "answer": "yes"}

We aimed to develope a simple endoscopic method, anterior meatuscopy, to replace the sniff test for selecting the most patent nasal meatus before UT-EGD. We hypothesized that access to the common nasal meatus (CNM), if confirmed by anterior meatuscopy, was a safer route than the inferior (INM) and middle nasal meatuses (MNM) because it would result in reduced epistaxis, nasal pain, and nasal discharge., According to another context, We used anterior meatuscopy and an endoscopic meatus scoring scale (EMSS) to identify the optimal meatus for insertion. We evaluated the EMSS frequency distributions for the INM, CNM, and MNM and the reliability of a sniff test in 1,000 consecutive patients. The adverse effects of passing through the CNM versus the INM and MNM, respectively, were compared., According to another context, In the INM and MNM, the EMSS frequencies were grade I\u200a>\u200aII\u200a>\u200aIII\u200a>\u200a0 whereas those in the CNM were grade II\u200a>\u200aI\u200a>\u200a0\u200a>\u200aIII.

{"question": "does immunocytochemical colocalization of p16 ( ink4a ) and ki-67 predict cin2/3 and ais/adenocarcinoma?", "passage": "Although previous studies have shown that p16(INK4a) and Ki-67 are sensitive and specific markers for high-grade lesions (\u2265CIN2) on cervical biopsies, limited information is available regarding the performance of a dual-staining approach as a diagnostic adjunct in cervical cytology. We evaluated a dual p16(INK4a)/Ki-67 immunocytochemistry (ICC) assay to determine its sensitivity and specificity versus that of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) in a US-based pilot cytology study., According to another context, ThinPrep specimens from 122 cervical cytology specimens encompassing 23 negative (NILM), 20 ASC-US, 22 LSIL, 17 ASCH, 22 HSIL, and 18AGC cases were processed for multiplexed ICC staining using a CINtec Plus Kit. Dual-positive assay results were defined based on the detection of 1 or more epithelial cells that were stained for both p16INK4a and Ki-67 without regard to cellular morphology. HR-HPV testing was performed by multiplex PCR with capillary electrophoresis genotyping., According to another context, Dual staining for p16(INK4a) and Ki-67 was frequently detected in HSIL and AGC but was rarely detected in NILM cases. The HR-HPV assay showed a sensitivity of 76.2% and a specificity of 55.8% for the detection of clinically significant cervical squamous or endometrial lesions. In contrast, the colocalization of p16(INK4a) plus Ki-67 maintained a high sensitivity of 81.8% and improved specificity to 81.8% for biopsy-confirmed CIN2/3, endocervical adenocarcinoma, or endometrial adenocarcinoma.", "answer": "yes"}

Patients were grouped by age and analyzed for incidence and type of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) including VOD., According to another context, The HSCT patients were divided into three age groups: G#1 \u2265 18; 9 \u2264 G#2 \u2264 17; and G#3 \u2264 8 years of age). The majority of transplant donor types were cord blood transplantations. Most prevalent ADRs represented acute graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD) and VOD. Although the incidences of aGVHD did not vary among the groups, the higher frequency ratios of VOD in G#3 suggested that an age of 8 or younger is a risk factor for developing VOD in HSCT patients. After cyclosporine therapy, the trough plasma concentrations of cyclosporine were lower in G#3 than in G#1, indicative of its increased clearance. Moreover, in G#3 only, a maximal total bilirubin level (BILmax) of \u2265 1.4 mg/dL correlated with VOD incidence after cyclosporine therapy.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "does insulin promote vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis via differential regulation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand?", "passage": "Insulin regulates glucose homeostasis but can also promote vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) proliferation, important in atherogenesis. Recently, we showed that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) stimulates intimal thickening via accelerated growth of VSMCs. The aim of the present study was to determine whether insulin-induced effects on VSMCs occur via TRAIL., According to another context, Expression of TRAIL and TRAIL receptor in response to insulin and glucose was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional activity was assessed using wild-type and site-specific mutations of the TRAIL promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies were performed. VSMC proliferation and apoptosis was measured., According to another context, Insulin and glucose exposure to VSMC for 24\u2009h stimulated TRAIL mRNA expression. This was also evident at the transcriptional level. Both insulin- and glucose-inducible TRAIL transcriptional activity was blocked by dominant-negative specificity protein-1 (Sp1) overexpression. There are five functional Sp1-binding elements (Sp1-1, Sp1-2, Sp-5/6 and Sp1-7) on the TRAIL promoter. Insulin required the Sp1-1 and Sp1-2 sites, but glucose needed all Sp1-binding sites to induce transcription. Furthermore, insulin (but not glucose) was able to promote VSMC proliferation over time, associated with increased decoy receptor-2 (DcR2) expression. In contrast, chronic 5-day exposure of VSMC to 1\u2009\u00b5g/mL insulin repressed TRAIL and DcR2 expression, and reduced Sp1 enrichment on the TRAIL promoter. This was associated with increased cell death.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "is staphylococcus aureus throat carriage associated with abo-/secretor status?", "passage": "In 30% of carriers, Staphylococcus aureus colonization affects exclusively the pharynx and occurs independently from its presence in the nares. This additional reservoir has implications for S. aureus transmission, infection, and decolonization. Host factors promoting colonization of the throat, however, are unknown., According to another context, We determined pharyngeal and persistent nasal carriage of S. aureus, ABO histo-blood group and ABH secretor status phenotypes in 227 individuals., According to another context, Compared to group A/non-secretors, group O/non-secretor individuals were at increased risk of carrying S. aureus in their throat (OR 6.50, 95% confidence interval 1.28-33.03, P = 0.02) and group O/secretor individuals were protected (OR 0.24, 0.07-0.77, P = 0.02).

{"question": "does overexpression or absence of calretinin in mouse primary mesothelial cells inversely affect proliferation and cell migration?", "passage": "The Ca(2+)-binding protein calretinin is currently used as a positive marker for identifying epithelioid malignant mesothelioma (MM) and reactive mesothelium, but calretinin's likely role in mesotheliomagenesis remains unclear. Calretinin protects immortalized mesothelial cells in vitro from asbestos-induced cytotoxicity and thus might be implicated in mesothelioma formation. To further investigate calretinin's putative role in the early steps of MM generation, primary mesothelial cells from calretinin knockout (CR-/-) and wildtype (WT) mice were compared., According to another context, Primary mouse mesothelial cells from WT and CR-/- mice were investigated with respect to morphology, marker proteins, proliferation, cell cycle parameters and mobility in vitro. Overexpression of calretinin or a nuclear-targeted variant was achieved by a lentiviral expression system., According to another context, CR-/- mice have a normal mesothelium and no striking morphological abnormalities compared to WT animals were noted. Primary mouse mesothelial cells from both genotypes show a typical \"cobblestone-like\" morphology and express mesothelial markers including mesothelin. In cells from CR-/- mice in vitro, we observed more giant cells and a significantly decreased proliferation rate. Up-regulation of calretinin in mesothelial cells of both genotypes increases the proliferation rate and induces a cobblestone-like epithelial morphology. The length of the S/G2/M phase is unchanged, however the G1 phase is clearly prolonged in CR-/- cells. They are also much slower to close a scratch in a confluent cell layer (2D-wound assay). In addition to a change in cell morphology, an increase in proliferation and mobility is observed, if calretinin overexpression is targeted to the nucleus. Thus, both calretinin and nuclear-targeted calretinin increase mesothelial cell proliferation and consequently, speed up the scratch-closure time. The increased rate of scratch closure in WT cells is the result of two processes: an increased proliferation rate and augmented cell mobility of the border cells migrating towards the empty space.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does local delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor improve facial nerve regeneration after late repair?", "passage": "Facial nerve regeneration is limited in some clinical situations: in long grafts, by aged patients, and when the delay between nerve lesion and repair is prolonged. This deficient regeneration is due to the limited number of regenerating nerve fibers, their immaturity and the unresponsiveness of Schwann cells after a long period of denervation. This study proposes to apply glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on facial nerve grafts via nerve guidance channels to improve the regeneration., According to another context, Two situations were evaluated: immediate and delayed grafts (repair 7 months after the lesion). Each group contained three subgroups: a) graft without channel, b) graft with a channel without neurotrophic factor; and c) graft with a GDNF-releasing channel. A functional analysis was performed with clinical observation of facial nerve function, and nerve conduction study at 6 weeks. Histological analysis was performed with the count of number of myelinated fibers within the graft, and distally to the graft. Central evaluation was assessed with Fluoro-Ruby retrograde labeling and Nissl staining., According to another context, This study showed that GDNF allowed an increase in the number and the maturation of nerve fibers, as well as the number of retrogradely labeled neurons in delayed anastomoses.

{"question": "do cd43 signals induce type one lineage commitment of human cd4+ t cells?", "passage": "The activation and effector phenotype of T cells depend on the strength of the interaction of the TcR with its cognate antigen and additional signals provided by cytokines and by co-receptors. Lymphocytes sense both the presence of an antigen and also clues from antigen-presenting cells, which dictate the requisite response. CD43 is one of the most abundant molecules on the surface of T cells; it mediates its own signalling events and cooperates with those mediated by the T cell receptor in T cell priming. We have examined the role of CD43 signals on the effector phenotype of adult CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells, both alone and in the presence of signals from the TcR., According to another context, CD43 signals direct the expression of IFNgamma in human T cells. In freshly isolated CD4+ T cells, CD43 signals potentiated expression of the IFNgamma gene induced by TcR activation; this was not seen in CD8+ T cells. In effector cells, CD43 signals alone induced the expression of the IFNgamma gene in CD4+ T cells and to a lesser extent in CD8+ cells. The combined signals from CD43 and the TcR increased the transcription of the T-bet gene in CD4+ T cells and inhibited the transcription of the GATA-3 gene in both populations of T cells, thus predisposing CD4+ T cells to commitment to the T1 lineage. In support of this, CD43 signals induced a transient membrane expression of the high-affinity chains of the receptors for IL-12 and IFNgamma in CD4+ T cells. CD43 and TcR signals also cooperated with those of IL-12 in the induction of IFNgamma expression. Moreover, CD43 signals induced the co-clustering of IFNgammaR and the TcR and cooperated with TcR and IL-12 signals, triggering a co-capping of both receptors in CD4+ populations, a phenomenon that has been associated with a T1 commitment.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does selective and long-lasting neural blockade with resiniferatoxin prevent inflammatory pain hypersensitivity?", "passage": "Capsaicin can produce a selective and long-lasting neural blockade. Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is an ultrapotent vanilloid agonist with a unique spectrum of activities different from that of capsaicin. We sought to determine whether a single application of RTX to a peripheral nerve could completely prevent the long-lasting mechanical hyperalgesia caused by carrageenan injection. In rat experiments, RTX (0.001%) was administered percutaneously to the sciatic and saphenous nerves before the intraplantar injection of carrageenan. Responses to noxious mechanical (pressure on the paw) and thermal (hot plate) stimulations and changes in paw circumference were measured at various time intervals for 8 days after treatment. The administration of RTX resulted in mechanical and thermal hypoalgesia (for 2 and 8 days, respectively). Inflammatory hyperalgesia was completely prevented by the precarrageenan injection of RTX. Inflammatory enhancement of paw circumference was reduced by RTX (12.0 +/- 2.4 mm versus 6.9 +/- 3.4 mm, P < 0.005).

{"question": "does the antishock effect of anisodamine require the upregulation of \u03b17 nicotine acetylcholine receptors by il-10?", "passage": "Although anisodamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, has been used in China for treating various shocks for many years, the mechanisms are not well understood. Our previous studies have demonstrated anisodamine exerts its cholinergic anti-inflammatory action through indirectly activating \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\u03b17 nAChR). Because IL-10 is a critical anti-inflammatory factor, we investigated its potential role in the antishock action of anisodamine., According to another context, C57BL/6 and IL-10 -/- mice were intraperitoneally administered LPS and/or anisodamine, and the 24h survival rate, cytokine production and \u03b17 nAChR expression were examined. In addition, RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS, anisodamine and/or IL-10, and cytokine production and \u03b17 nAChR expression were investigated., According to another context, Anisodamine dose-dependently increased the 24h survival rate of C57BL/6 mice treated with LPS. The antishock role of anisodamine was significantly attenuated in IL-10 -/- mice. Anisodamine significantly decreased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 production in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells and C57BL/6 mice. However, it did not increase the level of IL-10 in the same experiments. In RAW264.7 cells, IL-10 treatment increased \u03b17 nAChR expression, which was further augmented in the presence of anisodamine. Spleens from IL-10 -/- mice expressed significantly lower \u03b17 nAChRs levels compared to IL-10 +/+ mice.

The malignant potential of an individual IPMT cannot be accurately predicted. Preoperative estimation of the risk of associated invasive malignancy with IPMT would be of significant clinical benefit. As aberrations in cell cycle regulatory genes are associated with the progression of precursor pancreatic ductal lesions to invasive adenocarcinoma, we examined expression of key cell cycle regulatory genes in the cyclin D1/retinoblastoma pathway and the transforming growth factor beta/Smad4 signalling pathway in a cohort of patients with surgically resected IPMT., According to another context, Sections of formalin fixed paraffin embedded pancreatic tissue from a cohort of 18 patients with IPMT were examined using immunohistochemistry for protein expression of cell cycle regulatory genes p16(INK4A), p21(CIP1), p27(KIP1), cyclin D1, pRb, and p53, as well as the cell signalling molecule Smad4. A comparison of expression levels was made between adenoma/borderline IPMT (10 patients) and intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma (IPMC) (eight patients, four of whom harboured invasive carcinoma). Statistical analysis was performed using the chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests., According to another context, Aberrant expression of the proteins examined increased in frequency from adenoma/borderline IPMT to IPMC. Specifically, there was a significantly greater incidence of loss of p16(INK4A) expression in IPMC: 8/8 lesions (100%) compared with 1/10 (10%) adenoma/borderline IPMT (p<0.001). Similarly, loss of Smad4 expression was associated with IPMC: 3/8 (38%) versus adenoma/borderline IPMT 0/10 (p<0.03).

{"question": "is changes in fat mass after initiation of maintenance dialysis influenced by the uncoupling protein 2 exon 8 insertion/deletion polymorphism?", "passage": "A high body mass index (BMI) has been reported to confer a survival advantage in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. On the other hand, body fat accumulation, especially visceral adipose tissue, is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, as well as a clinically important source of adipokines. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) uncouples respiration from ATP synthesis, thus regulating energy expenditure and fat oxidation. In this longitudinal cohort study, we investigated the impact of the UCP2 insertion/deletion (ins/del) polymorphism on body composition changes in ESRD patients starting dialysis., According to another context, A total of 222 incident Caucasian ESRD patients (mean age 53 +/- 12 years; 60% males) were investigated close to the start of dialysis with peritoneal dialysis (PD; n = 126) or haemodialysis (HD; n = 96), and again after about 1 year (n = 159).

{"question": "is low serum ferroxidase i activity associated with mortality in heart failure and related to both peroxynitrite-induced cysteine oxidation and tyrosine nitration of ceruloplasmin?", "passage": "Ceruloplasmin antioxidant function is mainly related to its ferroxidase I (FeOxI) activity, which influences iron-dependent oxidative and nitrosative radical species generation. Peroxynitrite, whose production is increased in heart failure (HF), can affect ceruloplasmin antioxidant function through amino acid modification., According to another context, We investigated the relationship between FeOxI and ceruloplasmin tyrosine and cysteine modification and explored in a cohort of patients with HF the potential clinical relevance of serum FeOxI., According to another context, In patients with chronic HF (n=96, 76 \u00b1 9 years; New York Heart Association class, 2.9 \u00b1 0.8) and age-matched controls (n=35), serum FeOxI, FeOxII, ceruloplasmin, nitrotyrosine-bound ceruloplasmin, B-type natriuretic peptide, norepinephrine, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured, and the patients were followed up for 24 months. Ceruloplasmin, B-type natriuretic peptide, norepinephrine, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were increased in HF versus controls. FeOxI was decreased in HF (-20%) and inversely related to nitrotyrosine-bound ceruloplasmin (r, -0.305; P=0.003). In HF, FeOxI lower tertile had a mortality rate doubled compared with middle-higher tertiles. FeOxI emerged as a mortality predictor (hazard ratio, 2.95; 95% confidence intervals [1.29-6.75]; P=0.011) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, smoking, sodium level, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In experimental settings, peroxynitrite incubation of serum samples and isolated purified ceruloplasmin reduced FeOxI activity while increasing ceruloplasmin tyrosine nitration and cysteine thiol oxidation.

{"question": "does physical training ameliorate chronic alcohol-induced hypertension and aortic reactivity in rats?", "passage": "The aim of this study was to investigate the interactive effect of physical training and chronic ethanol ingestion on changes in blood pressure (BP) and aortic reactivity response in rats., According to another context, Male Fisher rats were divided into four groups of seven animals each and treated as follows: (i) control (5% sucrose, orally) daily for 12 weeks; (ii) ethanol (4 g kg(-1), orally) daily for 12 weeks; (iii) exercise training on treadmill followed by sucrose daily for 12 weeks; (iv) exercise training on treadmill followed by ethanol daily for 12 weeks. The body weight and BP were recorded every week. The animals were anaesthetized with pentobarbital after 12 weeks; blood and thoracic aorta were isolated and analysed for ethanol and reactivity response using tissue bath technique, respectively., According to another context, The data show that exercise training significantly lowered the weight gain 6-12 weeks in ethanol-treated rats compared to ethanol alone or control rats. The systolic and mean BP significantly elevated 6-12 weeks, whereas diastolic BP elevated 8-12 weeks after ethanol ingestion. Exercise training lowered the BP close to the normal control values in ethanol fed rats. Blood ethanol level significantly elevated in ethanol group but decreased in exercise plus alcohol group. Aortic contractile response to phenylephrine in ethanol or control groups was attenuated by training with or without intact endothelium.

{"question": "does transcriptional responses and flavor volatiles biosynthesis in methyl jasmonate-treated tea leave?", "passage": "Tea (Camellia sinensis) has long been consumed worldwide for its amazing flavor and aroma. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which acts as an effective elicitor among the plant kingdom, could mostly improve the quality of tea aroma by promoting flavor volatiles in tea leaves. Although a variety of volatile secondary metabolites that contribute to aroma quality have been identified, our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of these compounds has remained largely incomplete. Therefore, information aboaut the transcriptome of tea leaves and, specifically, details of any changes in gene expression in response to MeJA, is required for a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of MeJA-mediated volatiles biosynthesis. Moreover, MeJA treatment could exaggerate the responses of secondary metabolites and some gene expression which offer a better chance to figure out the mechanism., According to another context, The results of two-dimensional gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometry showed that the terpenoids content in MeJA-treated tea leaves increased, especially linalool, geraniol, and phenylethyl alcohol. More importantly, we carried out RNA-seq to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to volatiles biosynthesis pathways induced by MeJA treatment (0\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h) in tea leaves. We identified 19245, 18614, 11890 DEGs respectively in the MeJA_12h, MeJA_24\u00a0h and MeJA_48\u00a0h samples. The \u03b1-Lenolenic acid degradation pathway was firstly responded resulting in activating the JA-pathway inner tea leaves, and the MEP/DOXP pathway significantly exaggerated. Notably, the expression level of jasmonate O-methyltransferase, which is associated with the central JA biosynthesis pathway, was increased by 7.52-fold in MeJA_24\u00a0h tea leaves. Moreover, the genes related to the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway showed different expression patterns compared with the untreated leaves. The expression levels of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-phosphate synthase (DXS), all-trans-nonaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl reductase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (type II), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase increased by approximately 2-4-fold.", "answer": "yes"}

Our objective was to isolate CSC from ACC and provide insight into signaling pathways that support their propagation., According to another context, To isolate CSC from ACC and characterize them, we used ROCK inhibitor-supplemented cell culture, immunomagnetic cell sorting, andin vitro/in vivoassays for CSC viability and tumorigenicity., According to another context, We identified in ACC CD133-positive CSC that expressed NOTCH1 and SOX10, formed spheroids, and initiated tumors in nude mice. CD133(+)ACC cells produced activated NOTCH1 (N1ICD) and generated CD133(-)cells that expressed JAG1 as well as neural differentiation factors NR2F1, NR2F2, and p27Kip1. Knockdowns ofNOTCH1, SOX10, and their common effectorFABP7had negative effects on each other, inhibited spheroidogenesis, and induced cell death pointing at their essential roles in CSC maintenance. Downstream effects ofFABP7knockdown included suppression of a broad spectrum of genes involved in proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether dietary nicotinic acid (NA) deficiency exaggerates and whether dietary NA supplementation alleviates alcohol-induced fatty liver., According to another context, Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pair-fed with 4 isocaloric liquid diets: control, ethanol (EtOH), EtOH with dietary NA deficiency, and EtOH with dietary NA supplementation, respectively, for 8 weeks. The control and EtOH diets contained normal levels of NA (7.5 mg/l). Dietary NA deficiency (0 mg NA/l) was achieved by removing NA from the vitamin mix, while NA was added to the liquid diet at 750 mg/l for dietary NA supplementation., According to another context, Chronic EtOH feeding induced significant lipid accumulation in the liver, which was not worsened by dietary NA deficiency, but was ameliorated by dietary NA supplementation. Liver total NAD, NAD(+) , and NADH levels were remarkably higher in the NA supplemented group than the NA deficient or EtOH alone groups. Dietary NA supplementation to EtOH-fed rats increased the protein levels of hepatic cytochrome P450 4A1 (CYP4A1) and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 without affecting their mRNA levels. Interestingly, we found dietary NA supplementation reduced the ubiquitination level of CYP4A1.

{"question": "does the ccr2/ccl2 interaction mediate the transendothelial recruitment of intravascularly delivered neural stem cells to the ischemic brain?", "passage": "The inflammatory response is a critical component of ischemic stroke. In addition to its physiological role, the mechanisms behind transendothelial recruitment of immune cells also offer a unique therapeutic opportunity for translational stem cell therapies. Recent reports have demonstrated homing of neural stem cells (NSC) into the injured brain areas after intravascular delivery. However, the mechanisms underlying the process of transendothelial recruitment remain largely unknown. Here we describe the critical role of the chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 in targeted homing of NSC after ischemia., According to another context, Twenty-four hours after induction of stroke using the hypoxia-ischemia model in mice CCR2+/+ and CCR2-/- reporter NSC were intra-arterially delivered. Histology and bioluminescence imaging were used to investigate NSC homing to the ischemic brain. Functional outcome was assessed with the horizontal ladder test., According to another context, Using NSC isolated from CCR2+/+ and CCR2-/- mice, we show that receptor deficiency significantly impaired transendothelial diapedesis specifically in response to CCL2. Accordingly, wild-type NSC injected into CCL2-/- mice exhibited significantly decreased homing. Bioluminescence imaging showed robust recruitment of CCR2+/+ cells within 6 hours after transplantation in contrast to CCR2-/- cells. Mice receiving CCR2+/+ grafts after ischemic injury showed a significantly improved recovery of neurological deficits as compared to animals with transplantation of CCR2-/- NSC.", "answer": "yes"}

Penile oxygenation was evaluated by hypoxyprobe immunostaining. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA expression were quantified by Real Time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)., According to another context, In BCN rats, we observed the onset of an overt condition of hypogonadism, characterized by reduced T plasma level, reduced ventral prostate weight, reduced testis function (including testis weight and number of Leydig cells), with an inadequate compensatory increase of luteinizing hormone. BCN induced massive penile hypoxia, decreased muscle/fiber ratio, nNOS, eNOS, PDE5 expression, increased sensitivity to the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and reduced the relaxant response to acetylcholine (Ach), as well as unresponsiveness to acute Tad dosing. In BCN rats, chronic Tad-administration normalizes penile oxygenation, smooth muscle loss, PDE5 expression, SNP sensitivity, and the responsiveness to the acute Tad administration. Chronic Tad treatment was ineffective in counteracting the reduction of nNOS and eNOS expression, along with Ach responsiveness.

{"question": "are patients with cervical metastasis and neoplastic pachymeningitis less likely to improve neurologically after surgery?", "passage": "Although many patients with cervical spine metastases are treated surgically, it is unknown whether certain subsets achieve better pain relief and improvement of neurologic function., According to another context, (1) Does tumor removal with reconstruction improve the neurologic status? (2) Is any subset of patients more likely to have neurological recovery from palliative surgery? (3) What is the rate of surgery-related complications?, According to another context, We retrospectively reviewed 46 patients who had palliative surgery for metastatic solid tumor metastases of the subaxial cervical spine. Indications were neurologic deficits, life expectancy longer than 6\u00a0months, and a Karnofsky Performance Score of 50 to 70. Surgery consisted of anterior tumor removal and reconstruction with titanium mesh cages and/or tricortical iliac crest allograft plus plate fixation or of a combined procedure with adjunctive posterior decompression and stabilization with lateral mass screw fixation. Postoperatively, neurologic Frankel score grade, Karnofsky Performance Score, and complications were recorded., According to another context, Five of 18 nonambulatory patients (Frankel B/C) became ambulatory again (Frankel D). No patients were Frankel Grade E preoperatively, whereas 19 of 46 gained Frankel Grade E after surgery. One patient worsened neurologically and died 4\u00a0months after surgery. Patients with neoplastic pachymeningitis had less neurologic recovery than those without. Complications included dural tears (three), wound infection (three), and tumor relapse at the same or an adjacent level (four). Two of these four patients had instrumentation-related complications.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "is reduced bile flow associated with parenteral nutrition independent of oxidant load and parenteral multivitamins?", "passage": "Reduction in bile flow is a characteristic of cholestasis related to parenteral nutrition. Light exposure of parenteral multivitamin preparations is the major source of peroxides contaminating parenteral nutrition solutions. They may contribute to local oxidative stress. Oxidants are reported to affect transport mechanisms across the hepatocyte membrane into bile. The authors hypothesize that an oxidant-antioxidant imbalance is involved in parenteral nutrition related cholestasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of multivitamin preparations and peroxides on bile flow in newborn guinea pigs receiving parenteral nutrition., According to another context, Three-day-old guinea pigs were fed enterally or parenterally with solutions containing 8% dextrose/0.45% NaCl +/- multivitamin preparation +/- amino acids +/- lipids. The influence of the oxidant-antioxidant balance on bile flow was evaluated using 500 microM hydrogen peroxide and 1% and 3% multivitamin preparations +/- Na metabisulfite. Four days later, animals were anesthetized and bile flow was recorded over 2 hours. Glutathione determinations were performed on bile and liver samples. The percentage of oxidized glutathione, reflecting the redox status, was used as a marker of oxidative stress. Data were compared by analysis of variance with P < 0.05., According to another context, Bile flow decreased first on initiating dextrose + NaCl infusion (a 25% decrease) and subsequently by adding amino acids (a further 30% decrease). Although antioxidant vitamins and peroxides modified the hepatic redox status, they did not influence bile flow.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "does cytokine-stimulated nitric oxide production inhibit adenylyl cyclase and camp-dependent secretion in cholangiocytes?", "passage": "The biliary epithelium is involved both in bile production and in the inflammatory/reparative response to liver damage. Recent data indicate that inflammatory aggression to intrahepatic bile ducts results in chronic progressive cholestasis., According to another context, To understand the effects of nitric oxide on cholangiocyte secretion and biliary tract pathophysiology we have investigated: (1) the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on NO production and expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), (2) the effects of NO on cAMP-dependent secretory mechanisms, and (3) the immunohistochemical expression of NOS2 in a number of human chronic liver diseases., According to another context, Our results show that: (1) tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon (IFN)-gamma, synergically stimulate NO production in cultured cholangiocytes through an increase in NOS2 gene and protein expression; (2) micromolar concentrations of NO inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production by adenylyl cyclase (AC), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent fluid secretion, and cAMP-dependent Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) transport mediated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and anion exchanger isoform 2, respectively; (3) cholestatic effects of NO and of proinflammatory cytokines are prevented by NOS-2 inhibitors and by agents (manganese(III)-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin [MnTBAP], urate, trolox) able to block the formation of reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS); (4) NOS2 expression is increased significantly in the biliary epithelium of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "are skin fibroblasts potent suppressors of inflammation in experimental arthritis?", "passage": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are characterised by their capacity to suppress immune reactions. This function was reported to be shared in vitro by fibroblasts but their role has been poorly investigated in vivo. This study explored whether fibroblasts isolated from skin may suppress the host immune response in a model of autoimmune disorder., According to another context, It was first confirmed that skin fibroblasts lack the capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts or chondrocytes but possess the capacity to inhibit in vitro the proliferation of T lymphocytes. Fibroblasts also secrete modulatory molecules, in particular prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide, similar to MSC. To assess their role in vivo, the collagen-induced arthritis model was used, and showed that similar to MSC the intravenous injection of fibroblasts efficiently suppress clinical signs of arthritis and delay disease onset. This effect was associated with reduced inflammation as reflected by biological parameters and increased levels of IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 in the spleens of treated mice. To characterise the mechanism of immunosuppression further, phenotypic analyses were performed and could not detect any induction of CD4 CD25 Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. A population of CD4 IL-10(+) T cells was, however, detected that was slightly increased after fibroblast injection and significantly upregulated after MSC administration.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "do mutations in the arabidopsis homoserine kinase gene dmr1 confer enhanced resistance to fusarium culmorum and f. graminearum?", "passage": "Mutation of Arabidopsis DMR1, encoding homoserine kinase, leads to elevation in homoserine and foliar resistance to the biotrophic pathogens Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and Oidium neolycopersici through activation of an unidentified defence mechanism. This study investigates the effect of mutation of dmr1 on resistance to the ascomycete pathogens Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum, which cause Fusarium Ear Blight (FEB) disease on small grain cereals., According to another context, We initially found that the dmr1-2 mutant allele confers increased resistance to F. culmorum and F. graminearum silique infection, and decreased colonisation of rosette leaves. Meanwhile the dmr1-1 allele supports less rosette leaf colonisation but has wild type silique resistance. Three additional dmr1 alleles were subsequently examined for altered F. culmorum susceptibility and all showed increased silique resistance, while leaf colonisation was reduced in two (dmr1-3 and dmr1-4). Amino acid analysis of dmr1 siliques revealed homoserine accumulation, which is undetectable in wild type plants. Exogenous application of L-homoserine reduced bud infection in both dmr1 and wild type plants, whilst D-homoserine application did not. Delayed leaf senescence was also observed in dmr1 plants compared to wild type and correlated with reduced Fusarium leaf colonisation.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "is topical tacrolimus effective in chronic plaque psoriasis . a pilot study?", "passage": "Cyclosporine for the treatment of psoriasis constitutes a new approach. Alternative systemic cyclosporine derivatives have been studied to find an immunosuppressive drug with fewer adverse effects. Tacrolimus is one of these new immunosuppressive drugs. Systematically, it has been proven effective in treating psoriasis. A topical formulation of tacrolimus is attractive because it has fewer adverse effects and is useful for a large group of patients. We report for the first time on the efficacy of nonocclusive topical tacrolimus in the treatment of psoriasis., According to another context, After a washout phase of 2 weeks, patients were randomized to receive 0.005% calcipotriol ointment twice daily, placebo ointment once daily, or 0.3% tacrolimus ointment once daily. One psoriatic plaque was treated with a surface area of 40 to 200 cm2. Efficacy was estimated using the local psoriasis severity index.

{"question": "are abnormalities in gastrointestinal motility associated with diseases of oxidative phosphorylation in children?", "passage": "Disorders of the mitochondrial electron transport chain enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) have neurologic, musculoskeletal, ophthalmologic, cardiac, and GI manifestations. Many adult and pediatric patients with disorders of OXPHOS have abnormalities in intestinal motility. The purpose of this study was to describe pediatric patients who initially presented with signs of GI dysmotility and were later evaluated and found to have a disorder of OXPHOS., According to another context, Data were collected on six patients, including initial GI and neurologic symptoms, histology of skeletal muscle biopsies, mitochondrial DNA mutational analysis, OXPHOS enzyme assay, upper GI barium imaging, technetium-99M liquid gastric emptying scan, upper GI endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and antroduodenal manometry., According to another context, All six children presented with symptoms of GI dysmotility within 2 wk of life. Patients later developed symptoms of neurologic disorders. All patients had abnormalities in OXPHOS enzyme analysis. Muscle histology showed nonspecific changes with no ragged red fibers. Sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA showed no recognized mutations. No patient had any evidence of intestinal obstruction or malrotation by upper GI barium imaging. Four patients had delayed gastric emptying. Three patients had endoscopic and histologic evidence of esophagitis.

{"question": "does ideal tibial intramedullary nail insertion point vary with tibial rotation?", "passage": "The aim of the study was to investigate how superior entry point varies with tibial rotation and to identify landmarks that can be used to identify suitable radiographs for successful intramedullary nail insertion., According to another context, The proximal tibia and knee were imaged for 12 cadaveric limbs undergoing 5\u00b0 increments of internal and external rotation. Medial and lateral arthrotomies were performed, the ideal superior entry point was identified, and a 2-mm Kirschner wire inserted. A second Kirschner wire was sequentially placed at the 5-mm and then the 10-mm position, both medial and lateral to the initial Kirschner wire. Radiographs of the knee were obtained for all increments. The changing position of the ideal nail insertion point was recorded., According to another context, A 30\u00b0 arc (range, 25\u00b0-40\u00b0) provided a suitable anteroposterior radiograph. On the neutral anteroposterior radiograph, the Kirschner wire was 54% \u00b1 1.5% (range, 51-56%) from the medial edge of the tibial plateau. For every 5\u00b0 of rotation, the Kirschner wire moved 3% of the plateau width. During external rotation, a misleading medial entry point was obtained. A fibular bisector line correlated with an entry point that was ideal or up to 5 mm lateral to this but never medial.

{"question": "does esophageal remodeling develop as a consequence of tissue specific il-5-induced eosinophilia?", "passage": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is an increasingly recognized disease that mimics gastroesophageal reflux disease. Recently, EE has been associated with esophageal remodeling, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the development of EE in patients and in an experimental murine model would be associated with eosinophil-mediated tissue remodeling., According to another context, Histopathologic analysis of basal layer thickness and collagen accumulation was performed on the biopsy specimens of normal individuals, EE patients, and mouse esophageal tissue sections following experimental induction of EE in wild-type, eosinophil lineage-deficient, interleukin (IL)-5-deficient, and IL-5 transgenic mice, with the latter 2 mice groups having decreased and increased esophageal eosinophilia, respectively., According to another context, An impressive accumulation of collagen in the epithelial mucosa and lamina propria, as well as basal layer thickening, was observed in the esophagus of patients with EE as well as in mice with experimental EE compared with controls. Significantly reduced lamina propria collagen and basal layer thickness were observed in IL-5-deficient mice and eosinophil lineage-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice following the induction of experimental EE. Furthermore, the esophagus of CD2-IL-5 transgenic mice showed increased basal layer thickness and collagen accumulation compared with nontransgenic mice, yet IL-5 intestine transgenic mice did not have EE-like esophageal changes. Additional analysis revealed increased IL-5 levels in the esophagus of EE patients, allergen-challenged wild-type mice, and CD2-IL-5 transgenic mice but not in IL-5 intestine transgenic mice.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "does regenerative therapy prevent heart failure progression in dyssynchronous nonischemic narrow qrs cardiomyopathy?", "passage": "Cardiac resynchronization therapy using bi-ventricular pacing is proven effective in the management of heart failure (HF) with a wide QRS-complex. In the absence of QRS prolongation, however, device-based resynchronization is reported unsuitable. As an alternative, the present study tests a regenerative cell-based approach in the setting of narrow QRS-complex HF., According to another context, Progressive cardiac dyssynchrony was provoked in a chronic transgenic model of stress-triggered dilated cardiomyopathy. In contrast to rampant end-stage disease afflicting untreated cohorts, stem cell intervention early in disease, characterized by mechanical dyssynchrony and a narrow QRS-complex, aborted progressive dyssynchronous HF and prevented QRS widening. Stem cell-treated hearts acquired coordinated ventricular contraction and relaxation supporting systolic and diastolic performance. Rescue of contractile dynamics was underpinned by a halted left ventricular dilatation, limited hypertrophy, and reduced fibrosis. Reverse remodeling reflected a restored cardiomyopathic proteome, enforced at systems level through correction of the pathological molecular landscape and nullified adverse cardiac outcomes. Cell therapy of a dyssynchrony-prone cardiomyopathic cohort translated prospectively into improved exercise capacity and prolonged survivorship.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "does starvation-induced activation of atm/chk2/p53 signaling sensitize cancer cells to cisplatin?", "passage": "Optimizing the safety and efficacy of standard chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin (CDDP) is of clinical relevance. Serum starvation in vitro and short-term food starvation in vivo both stress cells by the sudden depletion of paracrine growth stimulation., According to another context, The effects of serum starvation on CDDP toxicity were investigated in normal and cancer cells by assessing proliferation, cell cycle distribution and activation of DNA-damage response and of AMPK, and were compared to effects observed in cells grown in serum-containing medium. The effects of short-term food starvation on CDDP chemotherapy were assessed in xenografts-bearing mice and were compared to effects on tumor growth and/or regression determined in mice with no diet alteration., According to another context, We observed that serum starvation in vitro sensitizes cancer cells to CDDP while protecting normal cells. In detail, in normal cells, serum starvation resulted in a complete arrest of cellular proliferation, i.e. depletion of BrdU-incorporation during S-phase and accumulation of the cells in the G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle. Further analysis revealed that proliferation arrest in normal cells is due to p53/p21 activation, which is AMPK-dependent and ATM-independent. In cancer cells, serum starvation also decreased the fraction of S-phase cells but to a minor extent. In contrast to normal cells, serum starvation-induced p53 activation in cancer cells is both AMPK- and ATM-dependent. Combination of CDDP with serum starvation in vitro increased the activation of ATM/Chk2/p53 signaling pathway compared to either treatment alone resulting in an enhanced sensitization of cancer cells to CDDP. Finally, short-term food starvation dramatically increased the sensitivity of human tumor xenografts to cisplatin as indicated not only by a significant growth delay, but also by the induction of complete remission in 60% of the animals bearing mesothelioma xenografts, and in 40% of the animals with lung carcinoma xenografts.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does airway hyperreactivity be delayed after mild neonatal hyperoxic exposure?", "passage": "Wheezing disorders are prominent in former preterm infants beyond the neonatal period., According to another context, We used a neonatal mouse model to investigate the time course of airway hyperreactivity in response to mild (40% oxygen) or severe (70% oxygen) neonatal hyperoxia., According to another context, After hyperoxic exposure during the first week of postnatal life, we measured changes in airway reactivity using the in vitro living lung slice preparation at the end of exposure [postnatal day 8 (P8)] and 2 weeks later (P21). This was accompanied by measures of smooth muscle actin, myosin light chain (MLC) and alveolar morphology., According to another context, Neither mild nor severe hyperoxia exposure affected airway reactivity to methacholine at P8 compared to normoxic controls. In contrast, airway reactivity was enhanced at P21 in mice exposed to mild (but not severe) hyperoxia, 2 weeks after exposure ended. This was associated with increased airway \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression at P21 after 40% oxygen exposure without a significant increase in MLC. Alveolar morphology via radial alveolar counts was comparably diminished by both 40 and 70% oxygen at both P8 and P21.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "is upper cervical range of motion impaired in patients with temporomandibular disorders?", "passage": "Clinicians increasingly suggest assessment and treatment of the cervical spine in patients with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD); however, few studies have investigated upper cervical spine mobility in people who suffer from TMD. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether patients with TMD pain (with or without headache) present with upper cervical spine impairment when compared with asymptomatic subjects., According to another context, A single blind examiner evaluated cervical range of motion (ROM) measures including axial rotation during the flexion-rotation test (FRT) and sagittal plane ROM. Twenty asymptomatic subjects were compared with 37 subjects with pain attributed to TMD, confirmed by the Revised Research Diagnostic Criteria. Subjects with TMD were divided according to the presence of headache (26 without headache TMDNHA, 11 with headache TMDHA). One-way analysis of variance and planned orthogonal comparisons were used to determine differences in cervical mobility between groups. All subjects with TMD were positive on the FRT with restricted ROM, while none were in the control group., According to another context, The analysis of variance revealed significant differences between groups for the FRT F(2,54)\u200a=\u200a57.96, P<0.001) and for sagittal ROM [F(2,54)\u200a=\u200a5.69, P\u200a=\u200a0.006].

{"question": "does increased pulsatility of the intracranial blood flow spectral waveform on transcranial doppler point to peripheral arterial disease in stroke patients?", "passage": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common in patients with acute cerebral ischemia. Indexes of resistance derived from the systolic and diastolic velocities are routinely used in diagnostic transcranial Doppler (TCD) to detect intracranial arterial disease. We sought to explore whether these indexes can predict the presence of PAD in acute cerebral ischemia., According to another context, We prospectively evaluated consecutive patients with acute cerebral ischemia. On TCD, peak-systolic and end-diastolic velocities in both middle cerebral and basilar arteries were manually measured to calculate pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI). Increased resistance was defined as PI equal to 1.2 or more and RI equal to .75 or more. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements were performed and an ABI equal to .9 or more was considered predictive of definite PAD., According to another context, We included 95 patients (45 male, 50 female) aged 66 \u00b1 9 years with a median National Institutes Health Stroke Scale score of 3 (interquartile range, 8) points. The ABI was abnormal and consistent with definite PAD in 24 of 95 (25.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 16.4-34.2) patients. Increased PI did not differ among patients with and without PAD (20.8% vs. 28.2%, P = .60). Only 1 patient with PAD had increased RI as opposed to 4 patients without PAD (4.2% vs. 5.6%, P = 1.0). Increased PI was not found to be an independent predictor of PAD (odds ratio [OR], .68; 95% CI, .22-2.12; P = .51).

{"question": "is the association between implicit alcohol attitudes and drinking behavior moderated by baseline activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex?", "passage": "Intense alcohol consumption is a risk factor for a number of health problems. Dual-process models assume that self-regulatory behavior such as drinking alcohol is guided by both reflective and impulsive processes. Evidence suggests that (a) impulsive processes such as implicit attitudes are more strongly associated with behavior when executive functioning abilities are low, and (b) higher neural baseline activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with better inhibitory control. The present study integrates these 2 strands of research to investigate how individual differences in neural baseline activation in the lateral PFC moderate the association between implicit alcohol attitudes and drinking behavior., According to another context, Baseline cortical activation was measured with resting electroencephalography (EEG) in 89 moderate drinkers. In a subsequent behavioral testing session they completed measures of implicit alcohol attitudes and self-reported drinking behavior., According to another context, Implicit alcohol attitudes were related to self-reported alcohol consumption. Most centrally, implicit alcohol attitudes were more strongly associated with drinking behavior in individuals with low as compared with high baseline activation in the right lateral PFC.", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "does oncogenic gene fusion fgfr3-tacc3 be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation?", "passage": "Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) are critical for cell proliferation and differentiation. Mutation and/or translocation of FGFRs lead to aberrant signaling that often results in developmental syndromes or cancer growth. As sequencing of human tumors becomes more frequent, so does the detection of FGFR translocations and fusion proteins. The research conducted in this article examines a frequently identified fusion protein between FGFR3 and transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3), frequently identified in glioblastoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, oral cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and cervical cancer. Using titanium dioxide-based phosphopeptide enrichment (TiO2)-liquid chromatography (LC)-high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), it was demonstrated that the fused coiled-coil TACC3 domain results in constitutive phosphorylation of key activating FGFR3 tyrosine residues. The presence of the TACC coiled-coil domain leads to increased and altered levels of FGFR3 activation, fusion protein phosphorylation, MAPK pathway activation, nuclear localization, cellular transformation, and IL3-independent proliferation. Introduction of K508R FGFR3 kinase-dead mutation abrogates these effects, except for nuclear localization which is due solely to the TACC3 domain.", "answer": "yes"}

{"question": "does trpm2 mediate histone deacetylase inhibition-induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells?", "passage": "Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity results in growth arrest and apoptosis in multiple types of cancer cells. It has been well established that p21 is responsible for HDAC inhibitor (HDACi)-induced growth inhibition, while the mechanism underlying HDACi-elicited apoptosis in bladder cancer cells remains largely unknown., According to another context, In this study, the apoptotic response to HDACi (trichostatin A and sodium butyrate) with different concentrations was determined by flow cytometry analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted to examine the TRPM2 (Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 2) expression change on HDACi treatment. TRPM2 knockdown and overexpression were performed to investigate the role of TRPM2 in HDACi-induced apoptosis. The mechanism of HDACi-elicited upregulation of TRPM2 was studied by chromatin-immunoprecipitation., According to another context, HDACi efficiently induced cell apoptosis and TRPM2 upregulation in a time- and dose-dependent manner in T24 bladder cancer cells. Functional analysis revealed that TRPM2 overexpression promotes apoptosis of T24 cells. Conversely, TRPM2 depletion remarkably antagonized HDACi-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, HDAC inhibition-elicited TRPM2 upregulation is caused by the increase of acetylated H3K9 (H3K9Ac) enrichment in TRPM2 promoter.", "answer": "yes"}
