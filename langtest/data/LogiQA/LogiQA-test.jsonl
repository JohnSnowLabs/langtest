{"passage": "By analyzing the light released or absorbed by the atoms of an object, you can measure whether the object is far away from the earth or close to the earth. When the object is far away from the earth, the frequency of these lights will move to the red end (low frequency) of the spectrum, referred to as \"red shift\" \"On the contrary, it is called\" blue shift \". The unique light emitted by the atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles that make up the atoms, especially the electrons. If the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons it releases will also become higher, so the release and absorption frequencies will be blue-shifted. Conversely, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will be red-shifted. Astronomical observations have found that most galaxies have a redshift phenomenon. Moreover, the farther the galaxy is from the earth, the greater the redshift. According to this, many scientists believe that the universe must be constantly expanding.", "question": "Which of the following, if true, can best refute the views of the above scientists?\n\nA.
