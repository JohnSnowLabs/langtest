{"id":"39386676","document":"Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone.\nBut last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood.\nForestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting.\nYou can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist.\nAspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.\nThat's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens.\nThe last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago.\nSo Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.\nNot all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.\nThe idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.\nWell this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.\nRobert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.\nIt's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.\nCan we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?\nWell yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.\nThose branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.\nIt's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.\nThe trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.\nMeaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.\nThe only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.\nFingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!","summary":"Aspens are one of our most beautiful native trees and there's a huge demand for seeds to grow new ones for planting."}

The BBC revealed their names after obtaining the county court documents.\nMore than 80 people from the Home Office and police gave evidence between February and June ahead of the orders being granted in July, which the force has revealed for the first time now.\nTwo have already been issued, three men are being sought by police and three properties were visited by officers on Wednesday.\nThe men are forbidden from associating with each other and entering the city centre, Handsworth, Newtown, Winson Green and Lozells.\nIn a copy of an injunction seen by the BBC, gang members are also banned from appearing in music videos that include material linked to the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. One such music video was shown during the court proceedings.\nTen other men will receive the orders in jail where restrictions will be imposed on certain visitors to limit any gang associations, police said.\nAmong those to be given the injunctions in prison are two men believed to have been the \"armed response\" faction of the Burger Bar Boys.\nReial Phillips, 21, from Winson Green was jailed for 27 years last year after seven people were injured in a series of shootings during a feud with members of the Johnson Crew.\nHis co-defendant 23-year-old Ashai Gray, from Walsall, was jailed for nine years after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin.\nPolice said their actions \"brought fear\" to people in the West Midlands.\nGang injunctions came into force in England and Wales in 2011. Home Office figures show that between January 2011 and January 2014, 88 had been put in place.\nThe first one issued in the West Midlands was in 2012.\nBut solicitor Errol Robinson, who represented two of the four men jailed for the new year murders, criticised the move.\n\"They don't change behaviour or address underlying issues,\" he said.\n\"Injunctions become a bit of a trophy and encourage rebellion. Gang members like to show that they're not listening to orders so will breach orders.\n\"It's a cheap way of trying to solve crime but there is no evidence to suggest that they work.\n\"They're just a cosmetic gesture to show people that something is being done about gangs - but actually the results are minimum to none.\"\nFrom former gang members the BBC has spoken to, there is little support for the mechanism, BBC Midlands Correspondent Sima Kotecha said.\nShe said a number of gang members had said that if a person is banned from going to a certain part of a city, they will just go somewhere else and find others who have the same goal of causing violence and disruption.\nBirmingham has seen another spike in gun and knife crime in 2017, with nine fatal stabbings this year. None of the men named in the injunctions are involved, police said.\nDet Sgt Ian Comfort said: \"This is relatively new legislation and we believe that securing final full injunctions on such a large number of gang members is a UK first.\n\"The injunctions are applied for in the civil court in addition to sentences handed out by the criminal court for offences. They are an additional measure to help control the offenders and keep the community safe.\"\nSupt Mat Shaer, neighbourhood policing superintendent for Birmingham, said the injunctions were \"not sought lightly\" and the police, council and other groups had already made \"exhaustive efforts with these men\" and their families to try and steer them away gang culture.\nOrganised gangs in Birmingham have been a part of the city's life since the 1870s. Some have been mythologised on TV such as the Peaky Blinders.\nBut today's gangs linked to guns and drugs are far from glamorous and bring terror and misery to many people's lives.\nThe names Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew sprang on to the crime scene in the late 1990s.\nChaotic and quick to wreak violence, their crimes reached a crescendo one night at a new year's party in 2003 when two innocent teenage girls, Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, died in a spray of machine gun fire in a drive-by shooting as members of the Burger Bar Boys attempted to kill a Johnson Crew man stood outside a Birmingham party.\nThat shocking display of gang callousness led to a concerted effort by government, police and the city council, and 10 years later it led some to believe that the gangs had been defeated as gun crime fell dramatically.\nBut in the last 18 months, a new generation of would-be gang members have arisen and shootings have begun to surge upwards.\nEven in the last few weeks, the police have been shot at as they carried out an anti-gun operation in the Ladywood area of the city.\nThe men made subject to the injunctions","summary":"Two rival criminal groups have been hit with what police describe as the largest ever gang injunction."}
