While illustrating this, he points out that when the action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal of a chemical synapse, the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open. Ca2+ ions trigger the release of neurotransmitters from vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. In this type of synaptic transmission, increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels cause the release of a neurotransmitter from small vesicles with dense cores.

A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious.

This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes.

{"original_question":"Question:\nBackground and Methods:\nAldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001).

{"original_question":"Question:\nA 48-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a headache, intermittent fevers and chills, generalized arthralgias, excessive thirst, increased fluid intake, and a progressive rash that developed on her back. Three days before seeking evaluation at the hospital, she noticed a small, slightly raised lesion appearing like a spider or insect bite on her back, which she considered to be a scab covering the affected region. The patient's fever reached 39.4\u00b0C (102.9\u00b0F) 2 days before coming to the hospital, with an intensifying burning sensation on the affected site. When a family member examined the bite, it was noticed that the bump had transformed into a circular rash. The patient took over-the-counter ibuprofen for intense pain so she could sleep through the night. The day before her hospital visit, the patient felt exhausted but managed to complete a normal workday. On the day of the hospital visit, she awoke feeling very ill, with shooting joint pains, high fevers, and excessive thirst, which led to her to seek medical attention. On physical examination, her temperature was 40.1\u00b0C (104.2\u00b0F), and there was a large circular red rash with a bulls-eye appearance (17 \u00d7 19 cm in diameter) on her back. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Her past medical and surgical histories were not significant apart from a history of anaphylaxis when taking a tetracycline. She recalled a walk in the woods 3 weeks before this exam but denied finding a tick or any other ectoparasite on her body. She denied any nutritional or inhalational allergies, although she emphasized that she is allergic to tetracyclines. Based on her symptoms, medical history, and physical examination findings, the attending physician decides to institute antimicrobial therapy immediately.

{"original_question":"Question:\nBackground: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.\nMethods: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose, 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (target dose, 50 mg twice daily). The patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), the previous admission for a cardiovascular indication, an ejection fraction of < 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention-to-treat.\nFindings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD, 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (SD, 0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (SD, 11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017).

The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008).

The rate of the other primary endpoint, death from cardiovascular causes, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events was reduced by inspra (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the inspra group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the inspra group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).\nWhich of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial?\nOptions:\nA: There was no significant difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia between trial arms.\nB: There was no significant difference in the rate of sudden cardiac death between trial arms.\nC: inspra, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreases all cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction.\nD: The most common causes of death seen in enrolled patients over the course of this trial were non-cardiac in nature.","answer_orig":"Eplerenone, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreases all cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction.","answer":"inspra, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreases all cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction."}
