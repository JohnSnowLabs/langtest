So when you vote for either of these parties, you're wasting your time.\nTweet 4. God doesn't want you to vote. The Bible says, \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\" Hosea 4:6 (KJV). Another translation reads, \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\" Hosea 4:6 (NIV). How much more knowledge do you need than the knowledge that your vote really doesn't count?\nTweet 5.

Would the results be different? Of course not. So, voting is useless.\nTweet 2. It's a waste of money. To spend thousands of dollars on a campaign is a complete waste of money.
