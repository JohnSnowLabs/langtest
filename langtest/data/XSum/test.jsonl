{"id":"39386676","document":"Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone.\nBut last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood.\nForestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting.\nYou can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist.\nAspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.\nThat's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens.\nThe last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago.\nSo Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.\nNot all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.\nThe idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.\nWell this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.\nRobert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.\nIt's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.\nCan we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?\nWell yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.\nThose branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.\nIt's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.\nThe trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.\nMeaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.\nThe only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.\nFingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!","summary":"Aspens are one of our most beautiful native trees and there's a huge demand for seeds to grow new ones for planting."}

Home Office figures show that between January 2011 and January 2014, 88 had been put in place.\nThe first one issued in the West Midlands was in 2012.\nBut solicitor Errol Robinson, who represented two of the four men jailed for the new year murders, criticised the move.\n\"They don't change behaviour or address underlying issues,\" he said.\n\"Injunctions become a bit of a trophy and encourage rebellion. Gang members like to show that they're not listening to orders so will breach orders.\n\"It's a cheap way of trying to solve crime but there is no evidence to suggest that they work.\n\"They're just a cosmetic gesture to show people that something is being done about gangs - but actually the results are minimum to none.\"\nFrom former gang members the BBC has spoken to, there is little support for the mechanism, BBC Midlands Correspondent Sima Kotecha said.\nShe said a number of gang members had said that if a person is banned from going to a certain part of a city, they will just go somewhere else and find others who have the same goal of causing violence and disruption.\nBirmingham has seen another spike in gun and knife crime in 2017, with nine fatal stabbings this year. None of the men named in the injunctions are involved, police said.\nDet Sgt Ian Comfort said: \"This is relatively new legislation and we believe that securing final full injunctions on such a large number of gang members is a UK first.\n\"The injunctions are applied for in the civil court in addition to sentences handed out by the criminal court for offences. They are an additional measure to help control the offenders and keep the community safe.\"\nSupt Mat Shaer, neighbourhood policing superintendent for Birmingham, said the injunctions were \"not sought lightly\" and the police, council and other groups had already made \"exhaustive efforts with these men\" and their families to try and steer them away gang culture.\nOrganised gangs in Birmingham have been a part of the city's life since the 1870s. Some have been mythologised on TV such as the Peaky Blinders.\nBut today's gangs linked to guns and drugs are far from glamorous and bring terror and misery to many people's lives.\nThe names Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew sprang on to the crime scene in the late 1990s.\nChaotic and quick to wreak violence, their crimes reached a crescendo one night at a new year's party in 2003 when two innocent teenage girls, Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, died in a spray of machine gun fire in a drive-by shooting as members of the Burger Bar Boys attempted to kill a Johnson Crew man stood outside a Birmingham party.\nThat shocking display of gang callousness led to a concerted effort by government, police and the city council, and 10 years later it led some to believe that the gangs had been defeated as gun crime fell dramatically.\nBut in the last 18 months, a new generation of would-be gang members have arisen and shootings have begun to surge upwards.\nEven in the last few weeks, the police have been shot at as they carried out an anti-gun operation in the Ladywood area of the city.\nThe men made subject to the injunctions","summary":"Two rival criminal groups have been hit with what police describe as the largest ever gang injunction."}

They imagine this as a tube sitting around the solid inner core, running along Earth\u2019s rotation axis.\nWhen liquid iron approaches the boundary from both sides, it gets squeezed out sideways to form the jet, which then hugs the imaginary tube.\n\"Of course, you need a force to move fluid towards the tangent cylinder,\" said Prof Rainer Hollerbach, also from Leeds and another co-author on the paper.\n\"This could be provided by buoyancy, or perhaps more likely from changes in the magnetic field within the core.\"\nAlthough the team believes it understands how wide and how long the jet is, the depth to which it descends is far from certain.\nDr Livermore told BBC News: \"It currently wraps about 180 degrees around the tangent cylinder.  Although observations only constrain the jet stream on the edge of the core, our theoretical understanding suggests that the jet could in principle go very deep indeed - possibly in fact all the way down to the edge of the core in the southern hemisphere (i.e. at the other end of the tangent cylinder).\"\nThat the team can make such inferences speaks to the impressive capabilities of the Swarm constellation.\nLaunched in November 2013, the European Space Agency satellites are providing unparalleled insights into the structure and behaviour of Earth's magnetic field.\nWith their highly sensitive instruments, they are gradually teasing apart the field's various components - from the dominant signal coming from the movement of iron in the outer core to the almost imperceptible contribution made by ocean currents.\nIt is  hoped the Swarm satellites\u2019 data could ultimately tell us why Earth\u2019s magnetic field has been weakening in recent centuries.\nScientists have speculated we could be on the cusp of a polarity reversal, which would see North become South, and South become North.\nThis occurs every few hundred thousand years.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos","summary":"Scientists say they have identified a remarkable new feature in Earth\u2019s molten outer core."}

Maybe not.\nBut there are some significant ways Mr Trump is already altering his campaign strategy - sometimes in direct conflict with promises and assertions he made during his long, successful race to the top of the Republican Party.\nHere are five.\nMr Trump has repeatedly boasted that he was paying for his campaign out of his own personal fortune.\n\"By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists,\" he posted on Facebook back in September. \"I am only working for the people of the US!\"\nEven though that's not exactly true - Mr Trump was loaning his campaign money and could someday pay it back, in addition to raising funds through donations - it was a central part of his pitch to those put off by the current political system.\nNow, however, all pretence is gone. Mr Trump announced he's hired a veteran money man - a former Goldman Sachs partner, no less - as his national finance chairman. And on Tuesday he reached an agreement with the Republican Party to conduct joint fundraising through a network of committees that can take donations of up to $449,400 (\u00c2\u00a3307,850) per person.\nMr Trump's move is an acknowledgement that he would be hard-pressed to self-finance a general election campaign, which could cost more than $1bn. He's wealthy - but he's not that wealthy.\nMr Trump has repeatedly insisted campaign-funded opinion polls are a waste of money.\n\"I don't have pollsters,\" he said last August. \"I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know, we have enough of that in Washington, with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and the lobbyists, et cetera, and the donors.\"\nIn fact, Mr Trump was dismissive of the whole idea of data-driven campaigns - including President Barack Obama's winning presidential bids.\n\"Obama got the votes much more so than his data processing machine, and I think the same is true with me,\" he told the Associated Press.\nThat was before the Trump campaign hired Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, a veteran of the presidential campaigns of Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Bob Dole and a host of other state-level candidates.\nAccurate, focused polling can serve as a presidential campaign's eyes and ears. It provides detailed information that helps a candidate's team determine where and how to spend resources.\nAt least that's what high-paid professional political pollsters will tell their candidates. And now Donald Trump is listening.\nLike many Republicans, Mr Trump loved to make fun of Mr Obama's reliance on Teleprompters during public events.\n\"I've always said, if you run for president, you shouldn't be allowed to use Teleprompters,\" he said in October. \"Because you don't even know if the guy's smart.\"\nPart of Mr Trump's appeal was his off-the-cuff style. He could say anything at any time, no matter how controversial - compared to controlled, careful career politicians like Hillary Clinton.\n\"I watched Hillary the other day, and she has the biggest teleprompters I've ever seen,\" he said in January. \"In fact, if you're sitting on that side of the room or that side of the room you can't see her because when they are outside, they are painted black and you can't even see her.\"\nThen Mr Trump used a Teleprompter to deliver a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March. And he used one to give a foreign policy address in April.\nHis campaign has said that more substantive, scripted speeches are in store, including on the military, education reforms and the Supreme Court.\nThis, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the Washington Post, represents \"the natural maturation of the campaign\".\nOver the course of his primary campaign Mr Trump hasn't been afraid to pick fights with fellow conservatives. He memorably sparred with Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly in the first Republican debate in August. He repeatedly criticised his party's foreign policy establishment. And he relentlessly disparaged the Republican Party leaders.\n\"They win their election, and they go to Washington, and they're with their wife or husband, and they say: 'Look at the beautiful columns. I don't want to leave this place, this is so beautiful,'\" Mr Trump said of Republican politicians in December. \"And they let us down.\"\nNow Trump has reunited with Kelly in a make-nice Fox interview. He's given a foreign-policy speech to a Washington think tank. He's made the rounds on Capitol Hill and \"planted seeds\" with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\nOn Wednesday afternoon he even had a closed-door meeting with the dean of the conservative foreign-policy establishment, Henry Kissinger.\nIn the past Republicans have pivoted from the right to the political middle. Mr Trump, it seems, is pivoting from the outside to the inside.\nOn Wednesday Mr Trump released his much anticipated list of potential Supreme Court nominees. For an unconventional candidate, it was decidedly conventional.\nWhile one judge, Don Willett of Texas, has an affinity for Twitter that almost rivals Mr Trump's, the list - eight men, three women, all white - is only surprising for its adherence to conservative orthodoxy.\nIt looks like it could have been the product of the right-wing Heritage Foundation. In fact, it largely was.\nAll of the names are judges currently on either state or federal courts, even though there is no constitutional requirement that Supreme Court nominees even be lawyers.\nWhile no one was expecting Mr Trump to suggest Hulk Hogan or Sarah Palin for the high court, his list looks a lot like business as usual for a Republican presidential candidate.\nThat may be just he way he wants it - but it's also not exactly what his primary campaign was all about.","summary":"Donald Trump has effectively won the Republican presidential nomination, leaving pundits and analysts wondering if a rhetorical \"pivot\" to a general election campaign is in the works."}

{"id":"40993250","document":"At Turf Moor on Saturday, Burnley and West Brom played out a game in which the ball was in play for only 160 seconds more than it was out.\nThough these are early days, no Premier League match so far this season has seen less action.\nTwo months ago, football's lawmakers revealed they were considering scrapping 45-minute halves, instead introducing two periods of 30 minutes, during which the clock would be stopped every time the ball went out.\nThe proposal, the International Football Association Board said, was one of a number of options to deter football's \"negativities\".\nSo would the rule have benefited supporters at Premier League matches so far this season? In a word, yes.\nOf 19 top-flight games across the opening two weekends of the campaign, the ball has been in play for more than an hour in only two of them.\nAnd no game has featured more than 61 minutes of play.\nFood for thought for fans and lawmakers alike.\nHere's the rest of the key Premier League statistics from the weekend.\nIt was a landmark weekend for Wayne Rooney as he joined Alan Shearer in the 200 Premier League goals club with his strike against Manchester City on Monday.\nHere's how and when he has scored them.\nRooney has some way to go to beat former Newcastle and Blackburn striker Shearer's record of 260 goals, although his goal at Etihad Stadium was his fifth in his past eight Premier League games.\nIf he can keep that up then who knows...\n... try, try again?\nWell doing just that doesn't appear to be yielding results in the Premier League so far this season.\nHarry Kane must have some sort of pox on him that prevents him from scoring in August, and it's hard not to sympathise as everything conspired to deny him a goal against Chelsea on Sunday.\nHe's attempted 14 shots so far this term - no player has managed more - all without reward.\n\"Obviously my decision not to read the British press was one of the best I ever made in my life.\"\nJudging by the above quote, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was perhaps getting a little tired of the criticism of his side's defending before they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday.\nIt was a welcome clean sheet after the Reds conceded three in their Premier League opener against Watford and then let in a late goal in the midweek 2-1 Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim. But is their defence really a problem?\nOn the face of it, the statistics suggest it is. No team has made more errors that have led to goals than Liverpool since 2012, while the Reds have not managed to concede fewer than 40 goals a season since 2009-10.\nA concern, no doubt, for a side with title ambitions. Only once in the past seven seasons has the Premier League been won by a side that has shipped 40 goals or more - Manchester United in 2012-13 (43).\nHowever, things appear to be going in the right direction under Klopp. Liverpool conceded eight fewer goals last season than they did in the German's first at Anfield, while Saturday's result against Palace was a fifth clean sheet from their past six Premier League games, as many as in the previous 21.\nThe run of four clean sheets in Liverpool's final four games of last season came with Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren in the side. When they are able to start together, Liverpool are generally rock solid at the back - of the 18 league games they started last season, the Reds lost just once and kept eight clean sheets.\nPossession football. Two words that will have Arsenal fans shuddering.\nThe Gunners often come out on top of the possession statistics but their game at Stoke on Saturday perhaps took the biscuit. With 77.3%, Arsene Wenger's side 'enjoyed' their highest possession figure in a single Premier League match since the 2003-04 season - yet lost 1-0.\nIt was a similar story for Tottenham. Against Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at Wembley, they threw everything (possibly including the kitchen sink) at the opposition goal, dominating the possession statistics with 68% of the ball - but ended up on the wrong side of a 2-1 result.\nClearly Chelsea were taking a leaf out of Burnley's books. Last weekend, the Clarets had just 38% possession compared with 62% for the Blues, but came away with the victory.\nJavier Hernandez did what Javier Hernandez does best on Saturday - score from inside the box.\nThe former Manchester United striker returned to English football by joining West Ham in the summer and scored in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014 with a brace against Southampton. Just like his strike against Newcastle 1,232 days ago, both of those goals came from within 18 yards.\nIn fact, not one of Hernandez's 39 goals in the Premier League have been scored from outside the area, making him one of the most lethal close-range finishers to have played in England's top flight.\nHernandez's failure to score from outside of the box is not for the want of trying.\nAgainst Southampton, the Mexico international had three shots on goal. Two from inside the box which ended up in the back of the net, the other from long range which, you've guessed it, went wide.\nThe fox in the box is very much in style. Of the 50 goals scored in the Premier League so far this season, only four have come from outside the area.\nLife just continues to get better and better for Huddersfield fans.\nThe Terriers, back in the big time after a 45-year absence, made it two wins from two in the Premier League by beating Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday.\nIt means they are now only the third team in Premier League history to win their first two games following promotion. Bolton, in 2001-02, went to finish 16th and earn another stint in the top flight - but Hull City last season would go on to be relegated. A sign that the season is a marathon and not a sprint.\nBut perhaps youthful exuberance will see David Wagner's men continue to upset the odds. Huddersfield have named two of the four youngest starting XIs in the Premier League so far this season - and average age of 25 years and 143 days at Crystal Palace and 25 years 331 days against Newcastle.","summary":"A 90-minute match but only 47 minutes and 40 seconds of actual football."}
{"id":"36543080","document":"Twenty years ago today, Craig Brown's side faced England at Wembley at Euro 96 and encountered the kind of cruel fate that leaves a lasting regret.\nScotland were undone by misfortune and brilliance; two momentary interventions that extinguished their hopes. The performance overall was not bereft, which was in keeping with the tournament as a whole since Brown's team drew 0-0 with the Netherlands in the opening match and went on to defeat Switzerland 1-0.\nEven so, the game still stands out in the long history of encounters between the Auld Enemy, for its circumstances, its drama and, to an extent, its heartache.\nEngland needed to recover from a disappointing 1-1 draw with Switzerland in their opening game that exacerbated the criticism of the players. Manager Terry Venables had taken the squad to Hong Kong prior to the tournament, where some were pictured out drinking heavily.\nDamage caused to the plane on the journey home brought further condemnation, while also building a siege mentality amongst the players and Venables, who had already announced he would be standing down after Euro 96 and would be succeeded by Glenn Hoddle.\nScotland were buoyed by holding the Dutch to a draw and although underdogs at Wembley, there was no sense of inferiority. Of the team that started the match, Colin Calderwood was at Tottenham, Colin Hendry had won the Premier League the year before with Blackburn (alongside England striker Alan Shearer), Gary McAllister was at Leeds and John Spencer was at Chelsea.\nThe rest of the team was made up of players from Aberdeen, Celtic and Rangers. For Scotland, naturally, the tie stirred memories of past excursions to Wembley and the fans mobilised en masse to London with a sense of living up to the zealous spirit of their predecessors.\nThe occasion worked with and against Scotland, though, since the England players were fired up by the historical significance of the game as much as the need to establish their worth at Euro 96. Before kick-off, England full-back Stuart Pearce could barely look at the Scots as they shook hands.\n\"You've got no friends when you play against a team like that,\" he later recalled.\nIt was a measure of Scotland's first-half performance that England used the interval to change their line-up. The game was still tied at 0-0, which suited Brown's side because the longer the game remained in the balance, the more doubt would enter the minds of the England players.\nVenables was too wily to be outfoxed, though. Recognising that his side was not dominating possession enough to threaten, he brought on midfielder Jamie Redknapp at half-time. Eight minutes into the second half, Redknapp was involved in the move that resulted in Gary Neville crossing for Shearer to open the scoring with a header.\nScotland were not subdued by the goal, and Gordon Durie's header forced David Seaman to desperately claw the ball away.\nDurie was involved in the next key moment, when he reached Stuart McCall's cross ahead of Tony Adams and was knocked over by the Arsenal defender's sliding challenge.\nMcAllister placed the ball on the spot, but as he ran to take his penalty kick, the ball rolled slightly. It was enough of a movement for Seaman to notice it and briefly wonder if the Scotland midfielder would stop and restart his run.\nInstead, he struck the ball firmly but relatively straight, and Seaman blocked the spot-kick. McAllister later insisted that the movement of the ball was not an excuse for missing, but also insisted that if he had scored, he was convinced Scotland's momentum would have driven them to victory.\nInstead, there was only further pain. Within 90 seconds the ball was worked out towards Paul Gascoigne, who lobbed it over Hendry then caught it on the volley to score past his Rangers team-mate, Andy Goram.\n\"You've got to hold your hand up at times and say it was a great piece of skill,\" Hendry later recalled.\nGascoigne ran to the byline and lay on his back while England players sprayed water into his mouth, mimicking the dentist's chair drinking game that had been caught on camera in Hong Kong.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe midfielder was typically mercurial, since it was his birthday the England players had been out celebrating in Hong Kong. He had been quiet in the opening match, too, and the Scotland bench were convinced Venables was about to replace him before he scored.\nThe England boss understood Gascoigne better than most, though, having worked with him at Tottenham as well.\nThe night before the Scotland game, Gascogine couldn't sleep and visited Venables in his hotel room. He confessed to being worried that he would not be selected for the game, and Venables told him he wouldn't be.\nEven with the player in tears, Venables left him thinking that for 45 minutes, before telling him he was playing and to get off to bed to sleep.\nSome of the Scotland players left the pitch feeling they had let their country down, while for many of the England players it was relief that underpinned their joy.\nThey went on to defeat the Netherlands 4-1, but Patrick Kluivert's consolation goal for the Dutch 12 minutes before the end meant Scotland were knocked out on goals scored, despite both countries finishing on four points and with a goal difference of minus one.\nEngland reached the semi-final, only to lose to Germany on penalties. Their defeat was overseen by Berti Vogts, who led his country to the title, and then six years later became manager of Scotland.","summary":"It remains a game that Scotland cannot escape."}

{"id":"19897695","document":"One of them, the blogger Prof Michael Pettis of the Beijing Business School, had earned kudos as one of the first to predict the sharp slowdown in China's economy seen over the last year.\nThe other was the Economist. The magazine, that is.\nTheir bet - for a bottle of booze - was over whether China's economy was about to run out of puff.\nThe country has managed 9.9% growth on average over the past 35 years, but Prof Pettis thinks that the growth rate will fall to a measly (by Chinese standards) 3% this decade.\nThe more gung-ho Economist by contrast was forecasting that China would stay on course to overtake the US as the world's biggest economy by 2018.\n\"China has grown very rapidly in the last 30 years, but it has been following a model that is not unique,\" says Prof Pettis.\n\"In the 50s and 60s almost everyone 'knew' that the Soviet Union would overtake the US in the 70s - even Jack Kennedy - but it didn't happen. Instead, the Russian economy got mired in debt and years of stagnation.\"\nOther examples include the Brazilian economic \"miracle\" of the 1960s and 1970s, says Prof Pettis, that ended in a 1982 financial crisis and a \"lost decade\" of growth, or Japan's rapid ascent up until its own 1990 crisis and subsequent two-decade stagnation.\nWhat these countries have in common is an enormous level of government-led investment - in roads, trains, schools, hospitals, education and training.\n\"You can get tremendous growth by keeping investment levels high,\" he explains. \"And in the early days, growth is healthy and sustainable.\n\"But later... you very easily reach a point where you can't identify economically viable projects any more, and you overshoot and start misallocating capital in a pretty significant way. That's when debt rises more quickly than the economy's capacity to service it.\"\nChina has been overinvesting perhaps since the 1990s, according to Prof Pettis, and certainly in the last five to 10 years.\n\"A lot of growth is fake,\" he says. \"If you spend $1bn building an airport, it generates the same amount of [economic output] today whether or not anyone actually uses the airport.\n\"If no-one uses it, however, the economic value created by the airport is not enough to repay the debt, and so future growth must decline as wealth is transferred from some other part of the economy to pay down the debt.\"\nHe says that there are three main sources of growth for China. The first, investment, is already exhausted. The second, exports, are also no longer viable, as China's main export markets in Europe and the US are depressed, and China's trade surplus has become politically contentious in those countries.\nThe third option is for ordinary Chinese people to increase their spending on consumer products and services.\nBut here the numbers just don't stack up. Consumers account for just a third of spending in China - an unprecedentedly low share for any major economy - while investment accounts for a whopping half of the economy.\nIf investment just stagnates - and in developed capitalist economies it usually falls after such a long boom - then, with consumer spending starting from such a low base, China would have to pull off the biggest consumer spending boom in history just to maintain overall economic growth at the planned rate of 7%-8%.\nBut the kinds of policies that would be needed to pull this off - such as paying Chinese households more interest on their savings, paying Chinese workers higher wages at the cost of state-owned company profits, or providing Chinese migrant workers with decent social benefits - run up against powerful politically-connected interests.\nProf Pettis is doubtful that it can be done.\n\"The bet's still on,\" says Simon Cox, Asia economics editor at the Economist. \"Though it won't be resolved till the end of the decade.\"\nThe Economist's side of the bet - that China will overtake the US by 2018 - was the default scenario in an interactive forecaster that they stuck on their website to let readers play God with the Chinese economy.\n\"[2018] seems quite soon, but then you look at the individual assumptions, and they don't seem too whacky.\"\nOne crucial assumption is the exchange rate. Mr Cox's team expects the yuan to strengthen against the dollar, even while prices rise more quickly in China, meaning that measured in dollars China's economy could still grow very rapidly, even if in reality the country actually slows down.\n\"I agree with Pettis on a whole range of things. I think the investment rate is too high, and it is difficult to invest wisely when you are doing it so fast. A lot of investment, especially by state-owned companies, is inefficient.\"\nWhere he parts company with the Beijing-based professor is on the question of whether China is running out of decent investment opportunities.\nChina is still a very underdeveloped country, and he says the capital stock per worker - the quantity of buildings, machinery, infrastructure, vehicles and suchlike relative to the population size - is still very low by Western or Japanese standards.\nHe also says that while Prof Pettis is focused on where spending will come from, what really matters for long-term growth is China's ability to improve skills and adopt new technology.\nWill China fall flat on its face?\nChina's economic miracle\nChina businessmen's stories\n\"China is very good at absorbing knowhow from the rest of the world. It is much more open to foreign investment than Korea and Japan were. And it has a large domestic market, so foreign producers have an incentive to tutor local suppliers in their products.\"\nMr Cox confesses to being an old-school Keynesian. As such, he believes that even if - as Prof Pettis believes - China does run into the same problem as the West, that ordinary citizens are not increasing their spending fast enough, the government can cope.\n\"If the alternative is unemployment, it is better to employ people to do something, even if it is not very value-adding.\n\"Lots of people are still living in old housing units left over from the 1990s, so it would be worthwhile employing people to build replacements for those.

For his final question, he called on the PM to launch an inquiry into arms export licences to Saudi Arabia amid UN reports of coalition air strikes on civilians in Yemen.\nThe prime minister responded to that last point by saying the UK had some of the strictest rules for arms exports in the world. He added that Britain was \"not part of Saudi-led operations\" in Yemen.\nBut it was one of those weeks when reaction to what was said at PMQs overshadowed anything that was said during the session, as Labour seized on Mr Cameron's \"bunch of migrants\" comment.\nMr Cameron was coming to the end of a clash with Jeremy Corbyn about Google's tax deal with the government, when he decided, as he often does, to broaden out his attack to other issues.\nThe Labour leader had just accused him of failing to stand up to Google.\nMr Cameron replied: \"The shadow chancellor's pointing - the idea that those two right honourable gentlemen would stand up to anyone in this regard is laughable.\n\"Look at the record over the last week - they met with the unions and they gave them flying pickets.\n\"They met with the Argentinians, they gave them the Falkland Islands.\n\"They met with a bunch of migrants in Calais, they said they could all come to Britain.\n\"The only people they never stand up for are the British people and hard-working taxpayers.\"\nSeveral Labour MPs objected to Mr Cameron's \"bunch of migrants\" comments on Twitter, describing them as \"shameful\" and \"inflammatory\" and the PM as \"odious\".\nA Labour spokesman said Mr Cameron's use of the phrase \"demonstrates an attitude that is wholly unacceptable to a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep\".\nYvette Cooper, who is chairing Labour's refugee task force, said Mr Cameron should use \"much more statesmanship-like\" language on such a \"complex and sensitive\" issue, particularly given ongoing commemorations of Holocaust victims.\nShe got to her feet immediately after Prime Minister's Questions to raise a point of order\nShe asked Commons Speaker John Bercow to ask Mr Cameron to \"withdraw\" the comment.\nMr Bercow told Ms Cooper: \"You speak with enormous experience in this House and I respect what you say.\n\"I completely identify and empathise with your observations about Holocaust Memorial Day, which you and I on other occasions have marked at events together - so I take what you say extremely seriously.\"\nHe ruled that it was not \"disorderly\" or \"un-Parliamentary\" but added \"people will make their own assessments of this matter\".\nThe prime minister's spokesman said the government had spent \u00c2\u00a31.2bn to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in camps in the region and he said Labour's approach would \"open the door and provide an incentive for more to come to Calais\".\nAsked if he considered the phrase \"bunch of migrants\" to be pejorative the spokesman said \"the PM thinks that the key thing here is getting the policy right\".\nMr Cameron was accused by some opponents of using the \"bunch of migrants\" phrase to distract attention from criticism of the Google agreement.\nBut this was dismissed as \"silly and playing cheap politics\" by small business minister Anna Soubry\nShe told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had been using the \"language of ordinary people\", adding \"we all use slang\" in the heat of the moment.\nDavid Cameron insisted he has done more than any other prime minister to crack down on aggressive tax avoidance and blamed Labour for failures in collecting taxes from large multinationals.\nMr Corbyn claimed Google was paying an effective tax rate of 3% - and accused the government of sending out mixed messages, with Chancellor George Osborne initially describing the deal as a \"major success\" before No 10 rowed back, calling it a \"step forward\", while, he said, London mayor Boris Johnson labelled it \"derisory\".\nMr Cameron then went on to explain the measures the Government has put in place to tackle tax avoidance and evasion before claiming the tax rate for Google under Labour was \"0%\".\nMr Corbyn also pointed to a series of meetings Google had had with Government ministers.\n\"Millions of people are this week filling in their tax returns to get them in by the 31st,\" he said.\n\"They have to send the form back, they do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.\n\"Many people going to their HMRC offices or returning them online this week will say this - 'Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary, small businesses and self-employed workers?\"'\nMr Cameron brushed off the criticism by launching into an attack on all the things Labour did not stand up to, including migrants.\nFirstly: George Osborne risked sounded far too content when he hailed the deal as a \"victory\" and a \"major success\". Government spokesmen were reluctant to repeat his verdict.\nSecondly: Labour reacted quickly and managed to get a hearing. Their message sounded louder than their internal disputes, for a change.\nThirdly: voters care. The perception international firms get a better deal than ordinary people is toxic.\nHMRC collects tax, not ministers, and the government says it has acted and got results where Labour did not.\nBut few politicians ever caught the mood of a nation declaring themselves happy with a big business's tax return.\nMr Cameron began Prime Minister's Questions by announcing that a \"striking\" memorial to the victims of Nazi atrocities is to be erected beside Parliament, in Victoria Tower Gardens, where a number of monuments already stand.\nDowning Street said an international design competition will be launched in the coming weeks and the memorial built by the end of 2017.\n\"It will stand beside Parliament as a permanent statement of our values as a nation and will be something for our children to visit for generations to come,\" Mr Cameron said.\n\"It is right that our whole country should stand together to remember the darkest hour of humanity.\"\nThe SNP again challenged the prime minister to help those women born in the 1950s, affected by pension equalisation, with the party's leader at Westminster using both of his questions to press the point.\nHe called on David Cameron to respect a Parliamentary decision to immediately introduce transitional arrangements for those women negatively impacted (the vote was non-binding and does not compel ministers to act).\nMr Cameron did not address the point directly, but claimed the introduction of a single tier pension at \u00c2\u00a3155 a week would end discrimination because \"so many women retiring will get so much more in their pension\".\nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron is guaranteed one question at PMQs every month and he used his latest opportunity to urge the prime minister to do more to alleviate the refugee crisis facing Europe.\n\"The only way to challenge a crisis of that magnitude is by starting working with our European colleagues at the heart of a united Europe,\" he said.\nHe urged Mr Cameron to \"welcome in and provide a home\" to 3,000 unaccompanied children as recommended by campaigners.\nIn response, Mr Cameron said no country in Europe had been \"more generous\" in supporting refugee camps in the Middle East but the UK would not be taking part in the EU's refugee relocation and resettlement schemes as it was not in its national interest.","summary":"David Cameron is facing Labour calls to apologise for calling refugees at a camp in Calais \"a bunch of migrants\" at Prime Minister's Questions."}

Then if my partner has a degree too then I will marry him,\" she says.\n\"So what job do you want to do?\" I asked.\n\"Prime minister,\" she replied without hesitation.  Look out Meles Zenawi!\nAbay has joined a girls' club known as Berhane Hewan - Amharic for \"Light for Eve\".\nShe has learnt about issues which have prepared her to resist early marriage; personal health, HIV\/Aids, and the medical complications associated with giving birth at a young age, like fistula.\nFemale circumcision is also discussed and in the 36 villages where the clubs have been set up, I am told fewer girls are now getting cut.\nBeside the road several boys are playing table football. They seem to welcome the idea of delaying marriage.\n\"You can't afford to run a family when you're too young,\" said 20-year-old Tazab, who has no plans to wed any time soon.\n\"Also it's bad for a girl's health to have children too early,\" he says.\nIn a rectangular mud-walled building which serves as a meeting hall and classroom for the Berhane Hewan participants, I met 15-year-old Serkaddis Assefa.\n\"Because of the Berhane Hewan programme I know about the issue of early marriage. If I hadn't joined, I might have been married off already,\" she said.\nSitting alongside was her mother, Enguday Assefa, whose forth child was fast asleep on her back.\nAround Ms Enguday's neck was part of her dowry payment; a coin bearing the face of Ethiopia's last emperor, Haile Selassie, and another of Queen Taitu, wife of the monarch Menelik II who died in 1913.\n\"I still feel bad when I think about my friends who now have jobs and have reached different positions,\" said Ms Enguday, who was forced to quit school and was already married with a child by the age of  15.\nFor the Elders, the behavioural change which has only happened in the last five years is worth celebrating.\n\"When Nelson Mandela brought us together at our first planning meeting he did say to us: 'Be bold, talk to those whom others won't talk to, be on the side of the most deprived, the most isolated, the most undervalued in society,'\" recalls Mrs Robinson.\n\"And in many ways those young girls, brides and mothers are very undervalued by their community and have very little sense of self-worth so the issue of child marriage, as far as I'm concerned, is a very good way of having an entry point into the effect of poverty.\n\"The effect of a lack of equality within communities, the effect of harmful traditional practices on the community - the effect of all the things that the Elders should be championing.\"\nBerhane Hewan started off with 700 girls and at its peak reached around 12,000 - just a small fraction of the vulnerable population.\nWhile considered to be a successful initiative, the programme will need to be scaled up significantly to make a major difference in Ethiopia.\nFor the first time the girls here are starting to shape their own destinies.\nThe hope among the Elders is that lessons from Ethiopia's Amhara Region can be applied to other parts of the world where child marriage is common, like India.","summary":"\"I wanted to get an education but my parents were determined to marry me off,\" says Himanot Yehewala, an Ethiopian girl who was married five years ago at the age of 13."}

The company doesn't exist anymore.\"\nSalaries for Swiss top managers are higher than most and their taxes are lower.\nThese two things alone would not necessarily anger most voters, however.\nWhat has attracted support for Mr Minder's initiative has been a series of perceived disasters for major Swiss companies, coupled with salaries and bonuses staying high.\nThe main example is banking giant UBS, which wrote off billions in the wake of the 2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis, and then had to be bailed out by the Swiss government.\nAfter that, the bank lost more billions because of a rogue trader, and announced thousands of redundancies.\nBut high salaries and bonuses for the bank's top managers continued throughout.\n\"The fat cats are getting fattest in the banks,\" says Edouard Dommen of the Swiss shareholders group Actares.\n\"The other companies are getting fat, but not quite so grossly.\"\nMr Dommen, who supports the new measures, believes voters are especially angry about UBS, because their own tax money had to be spent to bail out the bank.\n\"People are fed up,\" he says. \"They know that this is at their expense.\n\"Small people had to dig into their own pockets to bail out these banks, and then see people, some of whom turned out to be literally crooks, walk off with their money, so of course they are angry.\"\nIf passed, the measures would give Switzerland some of the strictest laws on executive pay in the world, far tougher than the limit on bonuses just approved by the European Union.\nBoth the Swiss government and Swiss business leaders have been campaigning against the measures.\nThe government says it understands that voters want some control over high salaries and has offered a milder alternative, but so far this seems to have attracted little interest.\nMeanwhile the Swiss Business Association has been arguing that the measures would undermine Switzerland's ability to compete.\n\"Certainly, it will damage our competitiveness,\" says the association's deputy head of competition and regulation, Meinrad Vetter. \"We are against this initiative because it violates Switzerland as a business location.\n\"It's not good if the corporation law is too strict and too rigid in comparison to other countries, and with this initiative we will be an island in corporate governance all over the world.\"\nBusiness leaders have argued that some of Switzerland's biggest companies might simply leave, if they were unable to attract top quality managers because they were not allowed to pay them what they wanted.\nFor the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, such a move might actually be quite easy.\nThe company's current headquarters is in Basel, within sight of both the German and French borders.\nConcerns over loss of competitiveness, and fears that Swiss companies might emigrate, did at first seem to be striking a chord with voters.\nBut one event, caused ironically by Novartis itself, seems to have changed a lot of minds.\nIn February of this year it was announced that Novartis' outgoing chairman Daniel Vasella would be receiving a 72m Swiss francs (\u00c2\u00a351m; $78m) \"non-compete\" pay off over six years, designed to stop him working for other related industries.\nThere was amazement and anger in Switzerland. Mr Vasella's salary had been regarded by many as excessively high for some time. Meanwhile, Novartis had been cutting jobs.\n\"I thought this was absolutely astonishing,\" says Mr Dommen, a man who doesn't mince his words.\n\"He is an idiot. I say he's an idiot because given this vote is coming up, to do something so grossly provocative at that moment just guaranteed that the opposition was going to win.\"\nThe payment was scrapped in response to protests.\nAnd indeed, the latest opinion polls seem to reflect that, showing that 64% of voters will say yes to the \"fat cat initiative\".\nMr Dommen does not believe a yes vote will isolate Switzerland.\nInstead, he says, it would bring his country into line with public opinion across Europe.\n\"Times are changing throughout Europe,\" he says.\n\"The period when people could get away with these enormous salaries is going out of fashion.\n\"In Switzerland we are not on a different planet - it's going out of fashion here too. Most Swiss voters think something has to change.\"\nOpinion polls have been wrong in the past, of course, but all the signs are that on Sunday, Switzerland's fat cats will have to start tightening their belts.","summary":"Switzerland's voters go to the polls to decide on controversial proposals which would impose strict limits on the salaries awarded to top executives."}

Only Greeks, Bulgarians and Latvians smoke more.\nA survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 27% of Austrian 15-year-olds smoke at least once a week, more frequently than any other children in the OECD area.\nSeveral years ago, when many countries had already banned smoking in bars and cafes, Austria first adopted the idea of introducing separate smoking and non-smoking areas.\nSmall restaurants could choose whether to go smoke-free or not.\nLarger restaurants, like Cafe Ritter, were obliged to provide a separate smoking section, sealed off by glass partitions.\nThe law was heavily criticised by doctors and anti-smoking groups as half-hearted and badly enforced.\nEarlier this year, after the death of a prominent anti-smoking journalist from lung cancer, Austria's coalition government of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party announced plans to bring in a total ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018.\n\"We have finally arrived in Europe with anti-smoking protection,\" Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser said.\nHowever there were protests from the far-right Freedom Party and from Austria's Chamber of Commerce.\nThe Chamber of Commerce opposes the ban, because it says restaurants and cafes invested around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100m ($109m; \u00c2\u00a3714m) to install ventilation systems and glass partitions to accommodate the separate smoking areas.\nThe economy minister, Reinhold Mitterlehner, has said their interests will be taken into account.\nAt Cafe Ritter, one of the waiters, Michael Schneider, told me the smoking ban should be brought in as soon as possible.\n\"Working in the smoke is bad for the health of me and my colleagues,\" he said.","summary":"After years of debate, Austria's government has announced plans to introduce a total smoking ban in cafes and restaurants by 2018."}
{"id":"40671838","document":"Will that promising full-back relish being thrown deeper into the public spotlight?\nWhat if the \u00a3200m superstar doesn't settle in Paris?\nThese are the types of questions being asked by clubs as they consider investing eye-watering sums on new players.\nAn emerging field of analysts and experts believe they have the answers.\nBut how do they find them?\nEver sent a tweet you've come to regret?\nLast season, Burnley striker Andre Gray apologised and asked \"for forgiveness\" after homophobic tweets he sent in 2012 were shared.\nAnd, just last week, Chelsea forward Kenedy was sent home from their pre-season tour of China after being accused of xenophobia and racism. He apologised for the Instagram posts.\nBut what can a club learn from a player's social media presence?\nBen Wright is head of sport at communications agency Cicero, which produces reports on players for clients across the globe, including seven in the Premier League and two in Spain's La Liga.\nHe says: \"We look all the way through a player's online presence. By doing this you can get an idea of what kind of person they are and how their character has evolved over time.\n\"We analyse media coverage, social media, fans' forums, everything that is available online, across 13 languages, to build up a public picture of their life.\n\"Are they using social media late at night? Do they blur the boundaries of public and private? How have they changed over time as they have begun to earn more money?\n\"Are they posting the kind of insight into their private lives that fans really appreciate, or is it all about new cars and new clothes? And are they posting this kind of stuff regardless of whether it's been a good or bad result the weekend before?\"\nSome clubs have developed in-house teams - sometimes within their scouting departments - to perform similar research.\nBut in January, Cicero produced a report on a promising young Premier League player, who will remain anonymous.\nThe analysis uncovered a series of social media posts, dating back several years, that were sexually explicit in nature, and found angry responses to opposition fans that included offensive language.\nUltimately, the client who commissioned the report decided not to offer the player what would have been a significant development in his career.\nCase study: Andrea Belotti\nTorino striker Andrea Belotti has been linked with a move to the Premier League for much of the summer.\nIn July, Cicero was asked to produce a report on the \u00a390m-rated Italian, and the findings were largely positive.\nOne section in the report - written for a Premier League club - analyses the \"tone and approach\" of his social media activity, while another addresses the '\"likelihood of future issues\".\nBelotti's posts, which featured regular tributes to his wife and family, displayed \"no instances of bad language, prejudice or public disagreements\", the report said.\n\"It is extremely unlikely he would ever post something or engage with fans on social media in a way that brings himself or his club into disrepute,\" it added.\nBut, in a section titled \"social media presence\", it says there would - at this stage - be a slim chance of a club harnessing his online following to counter-balance a hefty transfer fee.\nBelotti's 30,000-plus followers were, the report said, heavily Turin-based; his appeal is markedly different to the global reach of, for example, Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.\nPerhaps that outweighed his good behaviour? Belotti, 23, remains in Serie A, where he scored 23 goals last season.\nReach, tone and risk\nFragile fan base\nNumbers\nIs he worth 100m euros?\nDespite the benefits to be gained from monitoring it, social media can give players an outlet to project themselves as something they are not.\nThat becomes harder when they cross the white line on match day.\nGeir Jordet, professor in sport psychology at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, works with several top clubs across Europe - including in the UK.\n\"The best way to learn about about the psychology of a player is to observe what he does on the pitch,\" he says.\nJordet has devised a model of 11 attributes that can be used to judge whether a player will succeed, or can be helped to succeed, at the very highest levels.\nAmong the things he advises clubs to do are watch a player immediately after they make a mistake, see how they communicate with team-mates and assess to what extent the player is proactively involved in the game.\n\"I have built up a research portfolio on observing players' body language in matches, and I help clubs to see that,\" he says.\nJordet says clubs must also ensure any new player must fit in with the \"coaching culture\".\n\"The heavy training culture at one club, for example, might be a very powerful part of their recipe for success, and they might be especially keen to sign a player who fits into that - someone like Romelu Lukaku, for example.\n\"But there might be other clubs who would be willing to take more of a risk on a player who does not seem to be as dedicated, because they are good at dealing with so-called problem players, those who might be easily distracted by life off the pitch.\"\nTo put it simply - everyone is different. Two individually brilliant footballers may not play well together.\nJesse de Preter, a director at Atticus Sports Management, says everyone involved in the talent-spotting process is thinking more than ever about the personality of players.\nBut he still regards it as an \"underdeveloped part\" of the business.\nDe Preter said: \"In the UK clubs it is a permanent search for talent, and many have specialists who are involved in the psychology of targets.\n\"The scouting departments, even at many of the Championship clubs, are full of people, full of TV screens, they have the most expensive software available, staff travelling constantly around the world. It is an extensive system, backed by a lot of money.\n\"Footballers are very highly paid employees, but for some reason we still think everyone should be treated in the same way. That is the same as saying: 'OK, it is physical training today, everyone runs five miles together.'\n\"You can see the proof every year. When a brilliant player goes for a lot of money somewhere, and does not do well, the player is blamed, the coach is blamed.\n\"Then, when the player goes away to another environment and becomes a star, everyone says 'oh it was too early for him', when there will be many other factors why it didn't work out, completely linked to his personality; the way he functions in a group, or the other people in a group.\"\nSo where does this fit in with the traditional methods used by scouts?\nTor-Kristian Karlsen is now an 'independent advisor' to clubs but he used to work as a scout across Europe. He believes that the \"expertise of psychologists is a useful addition to the scouting process\".\nHowever, he also makes the point that the traditional role of scout - if done well - has always involved \"studying players in a social context\".\nThis could include observing behaviour in training, a player's standing within the group dynamic in social situations, such as at a team hotel, or their reaction to the media.\nHe says: \"In our environment, you have seen so much of a player before you sign him - in training, in matches, interviews - and you have spoken to people that you trust, like previous coaches and other people in the football world. Usually the total of all that information is deemed to be sufficient to make a call on a player.\n\"If you look at a player like Kylian Mbappe, you know that he has come through the French elite national academy at Clairefontaine, then the Monaco academy, so already you know he has gone through an excellent school with really high standards. That would make you comfortable about signing him.\n\"Football always involves an element of risk. I don't think even the most skilled psychologist in the world could project with great accuracy where a player is going to end up. But of course it makes sense to involve such professionals, and there are clues to be found in his behaviour on the pitch, in his reputation, in his development.\"\nDe Preter describes the increasing focus on personality as a \"new trend\".\nAnd while former Tottenham and Liverpool director Damien Comolli says clubs have \"always checked players' backgrounds extensively\" he acknowledges the game is changing.\nHe says people are beginning to \"look more at the individual as a human being before as a football player\", a trend he describes as \"one of the main current topics in recruitment\".\n\"High-level sport is so demanding,\" he adds. \"If we get the wrong individual in on day one, that can destroy everything the club is trying to achieve.\n\"When I was at Tottenham we were thinking about a massive investment on a striker who was playing abroad. I travelled to meet him, and in our conversation I asked him why he would like to join Tottenham.\n\"His reply was: 'Well, I would like to live in London, because there I can have a quiet life with my girlfriend without everyone recognising me in the street.'\n\"I left that meeting feeling very uncomfortable. He never told me he wanted to win, he never told me he wanted to help the club or help himself improve.\n\"This is what clubs are trying to understand before they sign players, and now I think everyone is pretty much talking about the same thing: getting the right person in as well as the right player.\n\"It is a trend that is not going to stop evolving, and we are only at the beginning.\"","summary":"Will a \u00a3300,000-a-week salary change a hot prospect's attitude to the game?"}

{"id":"35646843","document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nA winner must be declared on the night - as an ice hockey rink needs to be laid at midnight for a match at the same Hallenstadion venue the following day.\nBut what else do you need to know?\nBBC Radio 5 live's sports news correspondent Richard Conway explains.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFifa's 209 nations will gather in Zurich for what is billed as an \"extraordinary congress\".\nIt was called after Sepp Blatter dramatically announced last June that he would step aside after 18 years as Fifa president.\nThe 79-year-old Swiss said he was \"laying down his mandate\", which has led to some concern he may not have actually resigned.\nHowever, Fifa officials are confident he will not make an awkward re-appearance - not least because he has been banned from football for eight years over a \"disloyal payment\" of \u00a31.3m to suspended Uefa president Michel Platini.\nBoth men deny wrongdoing and are appealing against their bans.\nBlatter also has no accreditation to get into the conference hall on the outskirts of Zurich where the congress is being held.\nThere are two big issues to settle.\nFirst, the FA representatives have to agree to a package of reforms designed to eliminate the problems that have plunged Fifa into crisis in recent months and restore its reputation.\nThen, if and when that is formalised, they have to appoint a new president.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGiven the hype and spin around the election the reforms have been slightly forgotten about - but they are vitally important to the organisation's future.\nOne Fifa insider believes it would be a \"disaster\" if measures to clean up the governing body fail.\nSpecifically, Fifa wants members to agree to term limits for top officials along with disclosure of their salaries.\nResponsibility for everyday business decisions will be removed from the \"political\" representatives of national associations.\nThe \"executive committee\" will be disbanded. In its place will come a new 36-member Fifa council, which will include a minimum of six women, to set global strategy.\nThe day-to-day running of Fifa will pass to a new \"general secretariat\" - equivalent to a corporate executive board - and the secretary general, effectively the CEO, will be a powerful position.\nThe checks and balances will be carried out by a series of committees, the most important of which will be the fully independent audit and compliance committee.\nFifa wants the regional confederations and national associations to mirror their efforts over time and they will place immediate new demands on them, such as annual audits.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nYou would think so given Fifa's recent history. However, officials aren't taking any chances.\nThe proposals need 75% approval to be passed.\nActing president Issa Hayatou has been very active in spreading the message about the need to adopt the raft of proposals.\nHayatou was censured by the International Olympic Committee for his part in the ISL scandal - where the sports marketing company paid $100m (\u00a366.2m) to officials, including former Fifa president Joao Havelange and ex-Fifa executive Ricardo Teixeira, in return for lucrative television and marketing rights throughout the 1990s.\nAdditionally, he has been accused of taking a $1.5m (\u00a31.1m) bribe from Qatar to vote in favour of their bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Both he and Qatar categorically deny any wrongdoing.\nSo it is of interest that Hayatou has been at the forefront of the reform efforts.\nHayatou has an unassailable reputation (although not in Europe) amongst large sections of the 209 Fifa nations, despite his alleged wrongdoing. His voice carries weight amongst the \"family\" and the vote should therefore be carried without any issues.\nFifa is still in a perilous position with ongoing American and Swiss investigations into the activities of current and former officials.\nAs it stands, the organisation is considered a \"victim\" by the US Department of Justice. But that could change.\nIf the DoJ believes Fifa is not reforming or is carrying on as usual then it could be charged under US racketeering laws designed initially to tackle organised crime.\nPassing the reforms are therefore vital if Fifa is to continue operating and not be shut down.\nYes. This is where it gets complicated.\nThe DoJ and the Swiss authorities are very interested in how the Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 World Cups were awarded and if any wrongdoing took place.\nIf Fifa were to be shut down it could render the contracts for both those tournaments null and void.\nGeopolitically that could cause huge friction, especially given the delicate military situation in Syria at the moment.\nIn addition, the US is a big ally of Qatar and has a strategic air base there.\nGiven all of this, many question whether there is the political will from President Barack Obama's administration to carry out the ultimate threat. One insider said recently he believes there is pressure on Loretta Lynch, the US Attorney General, not to act in this regard.\nFar from it.\nIn December, when the US made its second wave of arrests, it issued a superseding indictment.\nThere are 24 unnamed co-conspirators within the document, including high ranking Fifa officials and members of national FAs. Some may be cooperating with the US already, others not.\nAt some stage the US will have to act and a grand jury has been sitting in the US to consider ongoing matters.\nIn addition, the Swiss investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bidding process is ongoing. That enquiry has widened and has resulted in Blatter being criminally investigated.\nBig question. No one knows right now.\nIf they do take action, the effect that has on the election will depend largely on who is targeted and where. The US is believed to be diverting its attention away from America and more towards Europe, Asia and Africa.\nIt is hard to see the mechanism by which the election could be stopped - but this is Fifa, so let's not rule anything in or out just yet.\nSheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain is still the front runner according to many observers.\nHe has the backing of his own Asian confederation and Africa, though the continents do not vote as a bloc and the ballot is held in secret.\nHowever, such political backing from two of the biggest confederations should not be underestimated.\nThe national associations do not want to back the loser either\u2026 even though the vote is secret. There may be big swings in the vote between the rounds.\nFifa presidency: Meet Sepp Blatter's five possible successors\nWhat about GianniInfantino?\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe Uefa general secretary Infantino has, according to the 45-year-old Swiss' camp, made gains in recent weeks. They believe he is the man to beat.\nWell, yes\u2026 but this is the same PR team behind Prince Ali bin al-Hussein's failed election attempt last May.\nBack then they made very different noises in the build-up, briefing that 40-year-old Jordanian Prince Ali was unlikely to win but would give Blatter a bloody nose.\nSo their bullish confidence with Infantino should not be underestimated.\nInfantino has strong support in Europe, South America and significant backing in the potentially crucial Caribbean.\nThey also think they will get half the votes in Africa. If that proves true then it's game over. He wins. \"If\" is the key word though.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPrince Ali lost the support of Europe for this election when Platini announced he was standing.\nHe failed to make gains after the 60-year-old former France captain was banned and Infantino stepped into his shoes.\nA safe prediction for Prince Ali would be that he has between 20 and 30 pledges of support.\nThat means he simply cannot win - but he could be a significant player in deciding the eventual victor if he drops out and asks his supporters to back a rival candidate.\nFrenchman Jerome Champagne will stay on to the bitter end but is highly unlikely to get more than 10 votes.\nSouth African businessman Tokyo Sexwale's efforts have been something of a mystery and he has been criticised for running a lacklustre campaign.\nHe went on a joint visit to Robben Island, where he was a political prisoner, with Infantino on Monday.\nDespite that he says he will not quit. He seems to be playing a longer game - perhaps with his eye on a new Fifa if the current organisation is ever abolished.\nThere are 207 eligible voters, with Kuwait and Indonesia currently barred from taking part.\nThat may change on Friday and the total number of voters will be announced before the ballot.\nIn the first round, the winner needs two-thirds of the available votes. If no candidate achieves that then a simple majority (105 in a 209-nation contest) is all that is required to win.\nIf there is still no winner then a third round will take place and the candidate with the fewest votes in round two would drop out at this point.\nThe candidates will each have 15 minutes to address Friday's congress, which is due to start at about 12:00 GMT.\nIn theory, the first round of voting should start at approximately 13:30 GMT.\nFifa estimates each round of voting will take one hour and 40 minutes. A safer bet is two hours, judging by previous elections.\nSo the earliest a winner is likely to be declared is about 17:30 GMT\u2026 let's see.","summary":"Football's crisis-hit world governing body Fifa will meet in Zurich on Friday and elect a new leader to try to take the damaged organisation forward into a new era."}

{"id":"32106990","document":"Physicists hope it could lead to discoveries that could potentially represent the biggest revolution in physics since Einstein's theories of relativity.\nAmong them is Prof Jordan Nash from Imperial College London, who is working on the CMS experiment at the LHC.\n\"We are opening a new window on the Universe and looking forward to seeing what's there,\" he said.\n\"As much as we have a lot of theories of what might be out there we don't know. We'd love to find something completely unexpected and we might, and that's the exciting bit.\"\nThey want a glimpse into a world never seen before. By smashing atoms harder than they have been smashed before physicists hope to peel back another veil of reality.\nThe aim of the various theories of physics is to explain how the Universe was formed and how the bits that make it up work.\nOne of the most successful of these theories is called the \"Standard Model\".\nIt explains how the world of the very, very small works.\nJust as the world became very strange when Alice shrunk after drinking a potion in the children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, physicists have found things are quite different when they study the goings on at scales that are even smaller than the size of an atom.\nBy doubling the energy of the LHC, it will enable them to discover new characters in the wonderful and mysterious tale of how the Universe works and came to be.\nThe Standard Model describes how the basic building blocks that make up atoms and the forces of nature interact.\nAnd just as in Alice's stories it features some eccentric characters, notably a family of 17 elementary particles.\nSome are familiar from school physics lessons, household names if you like.\nOne of the best known in the sub-atomic world is perhaps the electron, which orbits the atom and is involved in electricity and magnetism.\nAnother flashy A-lister is the photon, which is a particle of light.\nBut most particles from the Standard Model family are more niche, a little more art house if you like, and have strange names.\nIn fact, one of them is actually called \"the strange quark\".\nAnd others from this group of particles are named as if by thoughtless and unimaginative parents: \"up\", \"down\", \"top\" and \"bottom\" though \"charm\" does sound a little more, well, charming.\nA couple of these combine in various ways to form protons and neutrons, which along with electrons make up atoms from which the world is made. These are all members of a group called \"fermions\".\nAnd there is another group called the \"bosons\", that quite literally hold the place together.\nThey are called the \"force carriers\" in physics text books and give rise to the forces of nature: electrical, magnetic and nuclear forces, which pull other particles together or push them apart.\nWith the discovery of the sub-atomic world's biggest celeb of all, the Higgs boson, scientists have now detected all the particles predicted by the Standard Model: a theory that beautifully explains how the Universe works in intricate detail.\nOr so scientists thought.\nIt is incomplete. For a long time physicists thought that their Standard Model theory could explain almost everything.\nThen came two phenomena that showed that it explained hardly anything.\nFirst was the observation that galaxies are rotating much more quickly than they should.\nThe faster a galaxy rotates the more material it contains.\nThe observations suggested that they contain five times more material than could be detected.\nThis invisible material has been called \"dark matter\" which physicists believe accounts for a quarter of the Universe.\nSecond was the observation that galaxies were accelerating apart from each other driven by an even more mysterious force that the researchers who discovered it called \"dark energy\".\nSo all in all the Standard Model, brilliant though it is at explaining how our tiny corner of the cosmos works can't account for how the remaining 95% of the Universe works.\nEven then, of the 5% it is good for it can't explain gravity.\nAnd, just as the erstwhile poster child of physics slinks off to find a place to curl up and quietly weep, comes the biggest humiliation of all: it can't explain why the Universe exists at all.\nShortly after the Big Bang there were equal amounts of matter, from which all the atoms, stars and planets are made and anti-matter.\nMoments later the two should have cancelled each other out, as ripples sometimes do when meeting in a pond, to create a gigantic blast of energy and then, nothing but light.\nOur very existence demonstrates that clearly this did not happen.\nYou might have thought that this was bad news for physics - but actually physicists such as Prof Nash couldn't be more excited.\n\"It's our biggest opportunity in a generation to find out what's the next step, where do we go from here and how do we explain the things we don't understand about the composition of the Universe.\"\nThat is what physicists are hoping for. With the Large Hadron Collider set to double its energy, physicists hope that they will discovery weirder and even more wonderful particles that will point the way to a new more complete theory of sub-atomic physics.\nIn other words a sequel, with new even more bizarre characters and with no doubt some twists and turns in the plot.\nBook two has the working title of: \"Beyond the Standard Model\".\nScientists hope to find evidence of the invisible \"stuff\" called dark matter: the unseen Cheshire Cat behind the grin of the visible Universe we see around us.\nThere are lots of different theories for what the cat might look like.\nAmong them is an idea called supersymmetry or \"Susy\" for short.\nThis idea predicts new particles that are invisible partners of the ones we know already about.\nOne of these could be dark matter.\nAnother idea is that dark matter could be explained by the wonderfully evocatively named \"dark sector\".\nThis comprises shadowy new particles that don't obey the same forces as everything else but cannot easily be detected. They might be the invisible culprits that have been making our galaxies rotate faster than they should.\nResearchers will also be looking to find particles that are manifestations of extra-dimensions that we cannot detect but are predicted in some theories that extend the Standard Model to incorporate gravity.\nAnd the LHCb experiment will be studying the differences between matter and anti-matter in unprecedented detail.\nWho knows, but possibly one of the biggest changes in thinking in physics for 100 years.\nResearchers, such as Prof Tara Shears of Liverpool University who is working on the LHCb experiment hope to have their first taste of so-called \"new physics: a set of discoveries that will radically transform the theories of physics and our knowledge of how the Universe works.\n\"If I could have just one outcome form the next run of the LHC this would be it,\" she explained with a far away look in her eyes.\n\"It would be to make a discovery so unexpected that it doesn't fit with any of our theories, something that would show us that we have been on the wrong track in our efforts to understand the way that the forces of nature work, the way that matter is composed, something that will knock our heads sideways to make us come from a new direction.\n\"And that would be the paradigm shift and that shift, in my dreams would lead us to a much deeper understanding of the Universe.\n\"It would be wonderful if we could make a head start that would point us in the right direction.\"\nThe sub-atomic world is set to become \"curiouser and curiouser\".\nFollow Pallab on Twitter","summary":"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been restarted after a two-year shutdown."}

{"id":"34941396","document":"This time last year rugby club Wasps was putting the final touches to its move from High Wycombe to Coventry, a 75 mile journey it hoped would transform it from a club losing more than \u00a33m a year into a thriving leisure business.\nAs part of its relocation Wasps did not just move into, but acquired, the Ricoh Arena stadium complex in the West Midlands city for \u00a320m.\nThe fact that the Barbadian artist - famous for hit singles like Umbrella, We Found Love, and Diamonds - is kicking off her high-profile tour in their stadium is a source of pride to club executives, and an indication of how far financially as well as geographically they have come.\nIt also illustrates how the Premiership club sees its new commercial model as being as much about leisure as it is about sport.\n\"The entertainment side is where we see the biggest commercial growth,\" Wasps Group chief executive David Armstrong tells me.\nIt was 13 months ago that Wasps, then based in Buckinghamshire, announced they would play their home games at the Ricoh Arena, completing the stadium purchase a month later. Their first game as owners of their new home was a win against London Irish in December 2014.\nA year on, the club is no longer the tenant of Wycombe Wanderers football club, but a multi-venue, multi-use business.\nMoving a major sporting \"franchise\" lock, stock and barrel from one city to another is not uncommon in the United States, but in the more conservative UK, such uprooting is greeted with suspicion.\n\"The primary reason for moving was commercial,\" Mr Armstrong said, speaking to the BBC at the annual Rugby Expo conference at Twickenham.\n\"We were looking to create a stable long-term business model that would take us forward over the next 250 years,\" he adds, referring to the length of their Ricoh lease.\n\"With our previous business model, we were losing in the region of \u00a33m to \u00a34m a year. Our only revenue then was ticket sales. Food and beverage sales went to the football club, while other revenue went to our sponsors.\n\"We were a shell of a club, and couldn't be competitive and make money.\"\nAs well as its new income strands, earlier this year, the club raised \u00a335m with the issue of a seven-year bond, paying a fixed gross rate of interest of 6.50% a year until 2022 . Funds raised were used to restructure the club balance sheet and pay down existing debt, including loans acquired with the Ricoh Arena.\nAccording to Mr Armstrong the banks backed the bond issue because of the strength of the club's various income strands.\nOwnership of the Ricoh Stadium complex gives Wasps control over other income streams, not just from rugby matches.\nAs well as the main sports stadium bowl, the purchase also saw the club acquire the indoor 12,000-standing-capacity Jaguar Exhibition Hall, which hosts smaller music concerts, and can also be hired for trade shows, company presentations and other business use.\nAnd the Ricoh also contains three restaurants, five bars, 20 retail units, one of the biggest casinos in England, and a 121 bed hotel. Meanwhile, football club Coventry City football club, currently top of League One, are paying tenants.\n\"We are now a full end-to-end leisure brand, hosting conferences, banqueting, concerts, but headed by the rugby club,\" says Mr Armstrong.\n\"The important thing is that the other income strands give financial stability to the rugby team, they wrap around it.\"\nHe said that before the club moved it carried out thorough research, which showed an appetite within the West Midlands region, home to about five million people, for top-flight rugby .\n\"So we knew there was a potential fan base before we arrived in the area,\" Mr Armstrong says. \"The West Midlands, although it has a strong rugby union heritage, has never had a Premiership club.\"\nHe adds: \"In addition, we were looking at what we thought was the ultimate stadium for rugby union.\n\"It is not too big, not Manchester United-sized.  It is a 32,000 capacity, where crowds of 19,000 and 20,000 look comfortable. And it is also the right size for us to grow into as we extend our fan base.\"\nAnd the club, which currently sits eighth in the Premiership table after four games, has further expansion plans.\nSchemes in the pipeline include building a new training centre in the next year or two in the Coventry area, a second or even third hotel at the Ricoh complex, and a new 150,000 sq ft \"multi-use leisure facility with retail, and food and beverage\".\nThere are also plans for an expanded Wasps rugby retail business in the West Midlands.\nMeanwhile, the club says it also wants to provide a \"compelling digital offer\" not only for its rugby fans at the stadium (such as ordering food and drinks from your seat), but also for its other business customers who use the Ricoh facilities.\n\"But we never lose sight of what we are,\" he adds. \"We are a leading Premiership rugby club, and that will always be the heart of what do.\n\"The revenue we make means we can invest in training centres, coaches, physios, players and salaries, to give ourselves the best possible chance on the pitch.\"\nDominic Hayes, commercial director of Premiership Rugby observes:  \"I think the work that Wasps have done to up sticks and move city is a testament to the strength of the Wasps brand.  We have got to acknowledge there is some real strength there.\n\"Similarly with the Wasps bond, that was on the strength of the Wasps brand, not the Ricoh.\"\nAnd, while other famous music acts have played in the main Ricoh Arena bowl in the past before Wasps took over, Mr Armstrong is particularly pleased at the Rihanna news.\n\"For us it is important to get these big names... and it's nice to give a poke in the eye to Birmingham,\" he laughs.","summary":"When pop superstar Rihanna last week unveiled her 2016 UK concert tour dates, her choice of opening venue was seen as a vindication for an English rugby union club that has financially come back from the brink."}

{"id":"37750798","document":"Chinese electronics firm Hangzhou Xiongmai issued the recall soon after its cameras were identified as aiding the massive web attacks.\nThey made access to popular websites, such as Reddit, Twitter, Spotify and many other sites, intermittent.\nSecurity experts said easy-to-guess default passwords, used on Xiongmai webcams, aided the hijacking.\nThe web attack enrolled thousands of devices that make up the internet of things - smart devices used to oversee homes and which can be controlled remotely.\nIn a statement, Hangzhou Xiongmai said hackers were able to take over the cameras because users had not changed the devices' default passwords.\nXiongmai rejected suggestions that its webcams made up the bulk of the devices used in the attacks.\n\"Security issues are a problem facing all mankind,\" it said. \"Since industry giants have experienced them, Xiongmai is not afraid to experience them once, too.\"\nIt has also pledged to improve the way it uses passwords on its products and will send customers a software patch to harden devices against attack.\nThe recall affects all the circuit boards and components made by Hangzhou Xiongmai that go into webcams. It is not clear how effective the recall will be in reducing the numbers of vulnerable devices hackers can call on to mount attacks.\nYes, and it probably will. The smart devices making up the IoT are proving very popular with the malicious hackers who make their living by selling attack services or extorting cash by threatening firms with devastating attacks.\nBefore the rise of the IoT it was tricky to set up a network of hijacked machines as most would be PCs that, generally, are more secure. Running such a network is hard and often machines had to be rented for a few hours just to carry out attacks. Now anyone can scan the net for vulnerable cameras, DVRs and other gadgets, take them over and start bombarding targets whenever they want.\nFor the same reason you would care if your car was stolen and used by bank robbers as a getaway vehicle.\nAnd because if your webcam, printer or DVR is hijacked you have, in effect, allowed a stranger to enter your home. Hackers are likely to start using these gadgets to spy on you and scoop up valuable data. It's worth taking steps to shut out the intruders.\nNot easily. Many of the devices being targeted are hard to update and the passwords on some, according to one report, are hard-coded which means they cannot be changed.\nThere is also the difficulty of identifying whether you are using a vulnerable product. A lot of IoT devices are built from components sourced from lots of different places. Finding out what software is running on them can be frustrating.\nAlso, even if recalls and updates are massively successful there will still be plenty of unpatched devices available for malicious hackers to use. Some manufacturers of cheaper devices have refused to issue updates meaning there is a ready population of vulnerable gadgets available.\nBecause security costs money and electronics firms want to make their IoT device as cheap as possible. Paying developers to write secure code might mean a gadget is late to market and is more expensive. Plus enforcing good security on these devices can make them harder to use  - again that might hit sales.\nDespite this, many industry bodies are trying to draw up standards that enforce good security habits. Unfortunately, these initiatives are taking time to have any impact, meaning there are millions of insecure devices already installed and working.\nRight now, we don't know. Some hacker groups have claimed responsibility but none of their claims are credible. We might never know because the vulnerable devices making up the IoT attack network are changing hands regularly as rivals scramble to gain control of as many as they can.\nIn one sense the large web attacks are marketing exercises which show how effective a particular network of bots can be when turned against a target. Competition among rival bot operators is ferocious so a successful attack can be a good way to impress potential customers. It might also persuade victims of extortion emails to pay up rather than risk being knocked out.","summary":"Home webcams that were hijacked to help knock popular websites offline last week are being recalled in the US."}

{"id":"35959949","document":"Nigel Farage is wondering why, as Jonathan Portes has been pointing out, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures for migration to the UK from other EU countries is so much lower than the number of National Insurance numbers allocated to EU nationals.\nAccording to the most recent comparable statistics, migration to the UK from the rest of the EU was 257,000 in the year to September 2015, but during the same period, 655,000 EU nationals registered for National Insurance numbers (Ninos).\nMr Farage smells a rat: \"They are pulling the wool over our eyes. Ninos are a simple and clear reflection of the real numbers of people in this country, as without them you can neither legally work, nor claim benefits.\"\nNow the government has promised to tell us how many of the Ninos issued are still active - in other words, how many of the EU citizens who registered are currently paying UK tax or claiming benefits.\nBut are Ninos a good measure of immigration?\nThere is no question that the official immigration figures, based on a survey taken at ports and airports, are imprecise, with the ONS 95% confident that the immigration figure is within plus or minus 23,000 of the true figure.\nMore importantly, though, the ONS figures only aim to measure long-term migration. They use the UN's definition of a long-term migrant as someone who moves country for a year or more.\nWhen it comes to National Insurance numbers, on the other hand, there is no minimum stay in the UK. Everyone who wants to work in the UK must have a National Insurance number, even if they're only working in the country for a few weeks.\nWhat's more, Ninos are unique to an individual, so once you've received one, it's yours forever. This means that not all those who HMRC reveal to be \"active\" will necessarily belong to people who have been in the country continuously since their number was issued - they could have left and returned.\nThe ONS statistics also include people who are not planning to work or claim benefits, such as children or non-working partners. These people don't need a Nino when they arrive, but can apply for one in the future. This means someone registering for a Nino could have arrived at any time, not necessarily in the year or quarter in question.\nIt's not hard to see how the two sets of figures would be different. The question is, should they vary this much, or is there a problem with the way the ONS currently gathers its data? HMRC has said it will work with the ONS to help reconcile all available sources of statistics, including Ninos, to ensure the figures are as accurate as possible.\nWith this process rumbling on - and the latest immigration and Nino statistics due out on 26 May - this issue is sure to keep providing fuel for the EU debate, coming just a month before the referendum.\nReality Check verdict: There are good reasons why the two numbers would be different, but they are strikingly far apart, and next month's figures showing how many of the numbers are active should help reconcile the two.\nREAD MORE: The facts behind claims in the EU debate","summary":"Campaigners to leave the European Union have been badgering the government about the reliability of the official immigration statistics."}

{"id":"19875247","document":"These colourful lizards can scamper rapidly up walls, scuttle along ceilings and even hang upside down on polished glass.\nYet the secret of their amazing climbing ability remained a mystery until relatively recently.\nThe underside of a gecko's foot looks like a tyre tread and is covered in millions of microscopic hairs. Each hair splits into hundreds of tips just 200 billionths of a metre wide.\nThe secret of this lizard's adhesion turns out to be the relatively weak intermolecular forces that draw materials together any time they get close.\nThese van der Waals forces nevertheless explain how a gecko can support its own body weight on just one finger, and a single gecko hair can lift the weight of an ant.\nTo un-stick, the gecko pulls its foot away at a different angle.\n\"What we're talking about is something that is about as sticky as sticky tape - it's not crazy glue,\" says Prof Kellar Autumn, who became intrigued by gecko adhesion after being funded to develop climbing robots by the US military.\nProf Autumn, from Lewis & Clark College in Oregon, added: \"What is special about it is that it is controllable. And its controllability is based on geometry and physics, not chemistry.\"\nThe effort to uncover the mechanisms behind gecko climbing has already yielded synthetic material that sticks in the same way.\nStick, peel and re-stick a piece of existing adhesive tape several times and it quickly loses its clingy properties.\nProf Autumn and Mark Cutkosky, from Stanford University, compared natural and polymer-based synthetic gecko hairs using a machine that simulated gecko climbing. This showed both versions could be re-used some 30,000 times without losing their stickiness.\nSynthetic adhesives could yield transformative applications in robotics, industry, medicine, sports and clothing.\nBut one possible use always comes up in any popular discussion: could they allow humans to scale walls like Spider-Man?\nIn 2007, physicist and engineer Nicola Pugno, from Turin Polytechnic in Italy, calculated that a person wearing gloves and boots made of carbon nanotubes and structured to mimic gecko feet could indeed cling safely to a wall or a ceiling.\nChallenges would include wear and tear and the propensity for dirt particles to collect and inhibit stickiness.\nThe suit would have to work on every kind of surface and for long periods of time. But Prof Pugno says: \"We are not very far, in my opinion, from a kind of Spider-Man suit.\"\nProf Metin Sitti, from Carnegie Mellon University, says the idea is \"not impossible\". Selecting a lightweight person and applying the adhesive to many parts of the suit (not just the feet and hands) would improve the chances of success, he explains.\nBut, he comments: \"We get questions like: 'Can you carry a one-tonne weight'. And we say: 'Maybe, but that's not our biggest advantage'.\"\nA. The toes of geckos are covered in ridge-like lamellae, producing a tyre tread pattern\nB. Millions of microscopic hairs, or setae, cover each toe. These are only as long as two diameters of a human hair\nC. Each seta ends in up to 1000 even tinier tips, called spatulae\nD. The spatular tips are only 200 billionths of a metre wide -below the wavelength of visible light\nSeveral institutes have been developing robots that can climb walls - Stanford University's \"Sticky-bot\" can be seen in action here. Some scientists envisage \"geckobots\" being used to search for survivors in a burning building or disaster zone, to explore the rocky terrain of Mars, or even as toys.\nBut many in the field are most excited by more routine applications.\nMedicine is one target area for these adhesives. They could spawn advanced bandages that can be removed easily after healing or gripping surfaces on instruments designed for delicate surgery. Since the mechanism works in the wet, it could be used to affix implants within the body.\nStanislav Gorb, from the University of Kiel, studies biological adhesion; his work also looks at the way beetles stick to surfaces.\nHe says gecko material has several advantages when compared with generic sticky tape. There is no \"visco-elastic\" adhesive to dry out, so it stays attached for longer and leaves no residue.\nBut he says that with current production methods, they are unlikely to replace classical sticky tape.\n\"Maybe in 5-10 years we will have a method that will make the tape very cheap - right now it isn't. Secondly, right now, the forces are in the range or even lower than traditional sticky tape.\"\nZip it up\nMetin Sitti thinks gecko material could provide alternatives to current \"closure\" technologies, such as hook and loop fastening, zips and sealing systems on food packaging.\nIt is one area he is exploring through his company NanoGripTech, set up to commercialise his lab's gecko work.\nSynthetic adhesives work best on glass; rough or uneven surfaces pose more of an obstacle. Getting high performance out of gecko material on a variety of surfaces and in different conditions represents the firm's first challenge.\n\"We have been focusing on what happens when the surface gets wet, oily, dirty and what happens when temperatures change from very cold to very hot,\" says Prof Sitti.\n\"The second challenge is how can you manufacture and sell this [material] at high volume and at low cost?\"\nProf Sitti is working on this problem and expects within a year to begin manufacturing at low volumes.\nA silicone-based bio-inspired adhesive made by German firm Binder has been on the market for some six months. Prof Gorb was involved with its development.\nThe company has been exploring medical applications and the \"pick and place\" technology used in clean rooms to precisely position components on to circuit boards.\n\"Clean rooms often work with suction systems. That generates dust and requires a lot of energy, which contributes to the cost,\" says Jan Tuma, managing director of Binder.\n\"We are only sticky on really flat, shiny surfaces. It depends on the pins per sq cm and at the moment we have 29,000 pins per sq centimetre.\n\"Geckos have more, but they have had millions of years to develop, and we have had only a few.\"\nProf Autumn says: \"We can look to Nature as a giant library of design principles. The way gecko adhesives work is so bizarre and so different from the way that adhesives have been engineered, that I don't think we would have invented it.\"\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk","summary":"Geckos are among the superheroes of the animal world."}

The average payment was \u00c2\u00a317,735.

We watch a giant tractor extend two vast arms to spray a bright green crop of wheat.\nThe farm attracts tens of thousands of pounds in CAP payments, but Bruce and Isabel are convinced that British farmers would be better off without them.\nIn their view, the subsidies swirling through the agricultural economy artificially inflate prices which means - according to Bruce - that the payments are not worth as much as they sound.\n\"If we don't have subsidies\", he says, \"I believe our costs would come down. Land values would probably come down, rents would certainly come down, machinery costs would come down because a lot of these things are priced at what the market thinks we've got in our pockets.\n\"So the loss would not be as great as many people think.\"\nAnd, because the payments come from the EU via the UK government, there is notorious bureaucracy. Isabel says it's hugely time-consuming and she resents it.\n\"For our children's future we should take things back in hand, make our own rules and regulations in Great Britain for our benefit.\n\"Now we have Brussels making our decisions. Yes, we have a slight input, but we can't change anyone's minds.\"\nOn his hill farm, Mark Williams has an answer to that.\n\"If they think there's going to be any less regulation, the UK is not going to revoke sheep tagging, they're not going to revoke the licences, they're not going to revoke the burial of livestock.\n\"We're still going to have to put up with all of that.\"\nWhat about access to markets? Of the UK's agricultural exports, just over 63% went to the EU with about 36% going to the rest of the world.\nMark says that makes the EU a crucial outlet.\n\"Over 90% of British beef and lamb ends up in the EU. With such a high number, to mess about with that could have big consequences.\"\nBut Bruce Udale argues that if the UK did withdraw, trade with Europe would not be over.\n\"With everything except sheep, we import more than we export, so I don't have too many worries that the EU would want to do a reasonable deal with us.\"\nAnother hot topic is labour. About 24,000 farm workers have come from the rest of the EU and at harvest-time the most labour-intensive farms - cultivating fruit and veg - require far more.\nThere are no exact numbers but some estimates suggest that around 60,000, mainly East Europeans, come for the summer.\nHidden behind tall hedgerows near Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire is Eric Drummond's fruit farm, where as many as 350 Bulgarians and Romanians work at breakneck speed, picking strawberries in huge plastic polytunnels.\nWithout EU membership, he fears that the supply would simply dry up and paralyse production.\n\"It's a huge risk to your business, to any horticultural business. The whole industry relies on this labour coming into the country. So we are personally in favour of staying in because there's no word on what happens if we come out.\"\nBut like every point in this debate, there's a counter-argument.\nBruce Udale says there could be a scheme, similar to one that operated in recent years, where foreign workers could be brought in for a temporary period.\n\"I say tick them in, know where they're going, tick them out when they've finished. We can't have them just coming and going.\"\nFarmers themselves are probably too small in number to make much of a difference in the vote, but their sector of the economy is hugely important.\nNot only does the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) command the largest share of the EU budget, but also the farms themselves provide much of the food we eat.\nAnd how that work is carried out, and how it's organised, shapes the landscape itself.","summary":"Behind the quiet tapestry of farmland stretching across the UK is a turbulent debate over Britain's membership of the European Union."}

The US insists on the right to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.\nIn 2014, a row over a Chinese oil rig near the Paracel islands led to clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels and anti-China riots in Vietnam.\nWhy Vietnam wants US weapons\nBeijing's new South China Sea islands\nHigh hopes for Obama visit\nWhite House officials had indicated the arms ban, in force since 1984, would be lifted only if human rights in Vietnam improved.\n\"Sales will need to still meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights, but this change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself,\" Mr Obama said after talks with President Tran Dai Quang.\nVietnam had been arguing for an end to the embargo, which was partially lifted in 2014.\nPresident Obama's easing of all remaining restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam is powerfully symbolic. But what does it mean in practice?\nUp to now, Vietnam has relied on Russia to supply most of its defence equipment, a legacy of the Cold War, when they were allies. The government would certainly like to diversify its sources, and is looking at a number of potential alternative suppliers. But it won't be rushing into the arms of US manufacturers just yet.\nOne reason is that a lot of US technology may be too sophisticated and expensive for Vietnam's needs. And while Vietnam's defence spending, which has doubled over the past decade, is driven by the rivalry with its giant neighbour China, it will not want to antagonise China by seeking state-of-the-art US weapons that might alter the military balance.\nAnother reason is the complicated process of procuring US weapons. In his announcement, Mr Obama said any military contracts would still be subject to provisos on human rights, and given the Vietnamese government's poor human rights record that might hold up possible arms sales in Congress.\nThe greatest potential for US sales probably lies in areas like military surveillance systems and coastal defence. Vietnam would welcome technology that helps it track Chinese naval forces. The partial lifting of the embargo two years ago was with the specific aim of improving US sales in this area, yet Vietnam is taking its time to decide what it most wants to buy.\nMr Obama's visit comes 41 years after the end of the Vietnam War in which the US sought to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam.\nSeveral million Vietnamese - civilians, communist fighters and South Vietnamese soldiers - were killed, as well as more than 58,000 US soldiers.\nBy the end of the war in 1975, the communists had gained control of the entire country.\nWhile in Vietnam, Mr Obama is expected to meet dissidents and make the case for Vietnam to remove obstacles to the US-led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal.\nAmnesty International on Monday accused Vietnamese authorities of \"carrying out their repressive business as usual\" in arresting six activists.\n\"Before leaving Vietnam, President Obama must insist on the release of all prisoners of conscience,\" said its international advocacy director, T Kumar.\nIn a separate move, Vietnamese officials have removed the accreditation of the BBC's Jonathan Head in Hanoi after accusing him of conducting an unauthorised interview - something he denies.\nThe US president flies later to Japan for a summit of the G7 industrialised nations. His visit will include a tour of Hiroshima, where the world's first nuclear attack was carried out in 1945 by the US, killing at least 140,000 people.\nThe lifting of the US arms embargo \"will tighten the strategic pressure on China\", Vietnamese Communist Youth Union newspaper Tuoi Tre says on its website.\n\"It will also provide Vietnam with leverage in future arms deals with traditional weapons suppliers, particularly its long-time security patron, Russia,\" the paper says.\nChina's privately-owned portal Sina News sounds a note of alarm, saying that the lifting of the arms embargo \"is a cause for concern\" because it may have an impact on territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\nA commentary (in Chinese) by Phoenix TV's news anchor Cheng Helin on Sina's \"Headlines Blog\" argues that Vietnam is being drawn into \"co-operation to contain China\" as part of \"a three-way alliance with the US and Japan\".

However, Dr Levine is concerned that eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too.\nMany previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion of them have been flawed.\nSome have investigated a relatively small number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts.\nThere is also concern that studies that claim to show a decline in sperm counts are more likely to get published in scientific journals than those that do not.\nAnother difficulty is that early methods of counting sperm may have overestimated the true count.\nTaken together these factors may have created a false view of falling sperm counts.\nBut the researchers claim to have accounted for some of these deficiencies, leaving some doubters, such as Prof Allan Pacey of Sheffield University, less sceptical.\nHe said: \"I've never been particularly convinced by the many studies published so far claiming that human sperm counts have declined in the recent past.\"\n\"However, the study today by Dr Levine and his colleagues deals head-on with many of the deficiencies of previous studies.\"\nBut Prof Pacey believes that although the new study has reduced the possibility of errors it does not entirely remove them. So, he says, the results should be treated with caution.\n\"The debate has not yet been resolved and there is clearly much work still to be done.\n\"However, the paper does represent a step forward in the clarity of the data which might ultimately allow us to define better studies to examine this issue.\"\nThere is no clear evidence for the reason for this apparent decrease. But it has been linked with exposure to chemicals used in pesticides and plastics, obesity, smoking, stress, diet, and even watching too much TV.\nDr Levine says that there is an urgent need to find out why sperm counts are decreasing and to find ways of reversing the trend.\n\"We must take action - for example, better regulation of man-made chemicals - and we must continue our efforts on tackling smoking and obesity.\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter","summary":"Humans could become extinct if sperm counts in men continue to fall at current rates, a doctor has warned."}

{"id":"32621768","document":"From the moment it premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Bande de Filles, or Girlhood, was a homegrown hit.\nThe film - \"a work of cinematic art\" according to The Guardian - made more than \u00c2\u00a31m (1,346 euros) at the French box office, was nominated for four prestigious Cesar awards and secured an international film release.\nGirlhood is the story of a black teenager, Marieme, who lives in the vast banlieues, or suburbs, of Paris. With a dead-end future in front of her, she forms a relationship with a group of other young girls.\nNone of its leads, including Parisienne Karidja Toure who plays Marieme, had ever acted before - a consequence, says director Celine Sciamma, of her not being able to find enough professional black actresses for the roles.\n\"We were looking for four months,\" she recalls, \"with a casting director and two assistants. We basically went everywhere.\n\"We went to agencies, but there were very few black girls. And then we went in to theatre classes and high schools, but we met most of our cast randomly on the street.\n\"We had to invent a group, with its alchemy and energy. But we also needed girls with wit, who were able to improvise, because some of the scenes required it.\n\"All the girls are non-professionals, whereas all the boys had already been on screen. That says something about the representation of black women in cinema.\"\nToure, 21, was asked to audition as she sat outside a restaurant in Paris's 14th arrondissement. \"At first I thought the casting process was a little strange,\" she admits.\n\"But there aren't many black actresses in Paris, so they had to do it that way. You know, black teenagers in Paris, boys and girls, don't watch French movies.\n\"When you watch French films, you don't see many black characters. So we boycott them, and watch American movies instead.\n\"During the casting there were around 300 girls, who all have dreams about being actresses. But I guess we don't really believe we can do it, because we don't see many others doing it.\"\nLike Richard Linklater's Oscar-winning Boyhood, Girlhood is a coming-of-age movie. The circumstances, though, are vastly different.\nSciamma grew up in the Paris suburbs herself and says she was writing \"from the things I know - that there are people who have such energy, but they are not given a vision of who they should be.\"\nTold by her teacher to stop studying and get a job, Marieme plays truant with her new group of friends and becomes a gang fighter. Soon, footage of her beating up other girls is filmed and put on to social media.\n\"It's very true to life,\" says Toure. \"If you know the suburbs, you know you have the same gangs, the same fights - every French teenager can relate to it.\n\"Even when I read the script, there were similarities to my life. I've been followed in stores by shop security guards who are told to do it just because I am black.\n\"My own teacher told me not to bother continuing to study, but to go and get a job.\"\n\"I wanted to make a contemporary film,\" explains Sciamma, \"and this is an important part of contemporary culture in France.\n\"The situation is defined by our history with France's former colonies, France's urban policies, even France's architectural choices with the housing estates that make up the banlieues.\n\"It's a very French setting with an universal plot, which is why I think it's being seen by an international audience.\"\nGirlhood earned Sciamma a Cesar nomination for best director, while Toure was nominated as most promising actress.\n\"I was only the second black actress to be nominated for a Cesar in France,\" she points out. \"I think this has to have an impact on the film industry.\"\n\"Girlhood is statistically and symbolically a step,\" Sciamma goes on. \"It can change something because it did well at the box office. It shows that there is an audience and an interest for black characters.\n\"The film allowed the faces of four young black women to be everywhere in the street of Paris, on billboards, in the subway. I hope it means more stories are on the way.\"\nToure has gone back to study but hopes to continue acting. \"Lupita Nyong'o is my inspiration,\" she says. \"I think perhaps her breakthrough in 12 Years a Slave was the British having their own Girlhood moment.\n\"I love her performances, but most of all she's a very dark black woman and she's proud of her colour. That's what I want.\"\nGirlhood is out in the UK and Ireland on 8 May.","summary":"The director and lead actress of a film about female teenagers that has been an award-winning hit across the Channel say they hope it will pave the way for more French films about young black women."}

In one recent call, she told Jean: \"I've been crying my eyes out because I've been so upset. All the painkillers - it's not doing me any good.\"\nShe understands why the visits have become phone calls but says: \"You feel closer to the people who are coming to visit you than [those who talk] on the phone, you get a picture of them.\"\nBetty is worried about how the cuts affect people in her age group and says they can't get the help they need.\nSelby has a Conservative MP, Nigel Adams, and District and County Councils with Tory majorities.

{"id":"14728563","document":"For a man supposedly worth millions, you would not know it by his boots. When the BBC interviewed Col Gaddafi in March, I was expecting the meeting to take place at a secret desert pavilion. Instead it was a seaside restaurant in central Tripoli. His eyes were hidden behind gold Cartier sunglasses. His flowing brown robes gave off the light scent of sandalwood. \"I don't like money,\" he said. \"I have a tent\". One look at his black cowboy boots and you would think he was telling the truth. The soles were cracked and pitted, the heels worn. Last week, when I walked around his Bab al-Aziziya compound on the day it fell, I saw where the money had gone. He had a tent like no other tent in the world. But by the end of the day it was just ashes.\nThe next image shows the last big demonstration in the Tripoli area of Tajoura before the authorities cracked down with pre-dawn raids and mass arrests. It was just after prayers one Friday in March. I went back the following week when the BBC team broke away from their government minders at the Rixos Hotel. There was no demonstration. The anti-Gaddafi graffiti had been painted over and the local imam told us many young people had been taken away during the night. Soon after we turned up, government heavies arrived in minivans to take us away. This was the last time journalists were able to move easily around the capital before it fell five months later.\nThe next audience with Col Gaddafi was on 2 March, the anniversary of the \"establishment of the people's authority\". This is when Col Gaddafi says he handed over all power to the people, so he could not technically stand down. The crowd was delighted, the rest of us bemused because he arrived in a brand new golf buggy, its front seat draped with a white sheepskin rug. He talked for three hours. Occasionally he allowed some chants and cheers, and then tapped his microphone, at which the crowd promptly shut up. The last time I saw Col Gaddafi, he was driving his buggy towards a lamp post. But his security team cleared a path and he drove off with two secret service types clinging to the back.\nThis was one of the government soldiers who had taken back the town of Zawiya, near Tripoli, from the rebels. The fighting was brutal as was the treatment of those arrested by the authorities. Some BBC colleagues were detained for 24 hours and subjected to mock executions. When journalists did get in, it was by media bus under strict supervision of the authorities, but the green-and-white bunting could not hide the scale of the destruction. The makeshift cemetery in the town square, where the rebels had buried their fallen fighters, had been bulldozed. The rebels winning it back proved to be a turning point in the war.\nThe man below was typical of the rebel fighters on the eastern front outside Ajdabiya in April. They were mostly disorganised and ill-disciplined. He was among those who fled at the first sign of an incoming round. It was at this time that the Libyan government was trying to push the idea that these fighters were linked to al-Qaeda. We tended to see them as more of a danger to themselves than to us. Their evolution into a proper fighting force took many months and some training from foreign military experts. Combined with a steady stream of new weapons and Nato's air campaign, over time they became a force to be reckoned with.\nYears of being silenced have led to an explosion of graffiti in Libyan towns and cities. Artists played a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities in Tripoli - they sprayed by night and government lackeys whitewashed by day. This wall - in Liberation Square in Misrata - is in no danger of being repainted. Less artistic but more poignant was graffiti by the family of Abdel Salem Fouzy Alshaba, a 23-year-old economics student. The day after I took this picture, I watched him die at a hospital on the city's western front line. He sustained head and back injuries from a grad rocket fired by Gaddafi forces. Within days, his family was using a spray can to rename streets across the city in his honour.\nThis building in the Bab al-Aziziya compound is where Col Gaddafi made most of his anti-Western speeches. It was bombed in 1986 by US warplanes in revenge for a nightclub bombing in Germany that targeted US servicemen. The fist crushing the US fighter jet symbolised Col Gaddafi's defiance. After the compound fell to rebel forces, young men were queuing to have their photo taken on it. A few days later, someone \"liberated\" the famous fist from its mount and it has not been seen since.\nThey could not get to the man so they were tearing apart everything he owned. This was inside Gaddafi's compound, where I watched rebels walking away with vases, paintings and fridges. What they could not carry, they smashed to pieces. Comparisons have been drawn with the fall of Baghdad, raising fears of what may follow. But Tripoli is a very different story. Only symbols of the regime have been attacked. The rest of the city has remained largely secure.\nThis would have got this young boy's family in a lot of trouble a few months ago. But the images people were once forced to mount at their homes and businesses are now used to show their contempt for the regime. This was outside a hospital in Misrata. But everywhere in Tripoli, people are walking over images of the self-styled father of the nation. Libyans have lived with the cult of Gaddafi for more than four decades. No-one knows where he is hiding, but what is clear is that this young Libyan is not going to grow up like his parents - in Col Gaddafi's shadow.","summary":"BBC's Middle East Bureau Editor Paul Danahar reflects on six months of covering the Libyan uprising from both sides of the conflict, using pictures of some of his more memorable moments."}

{"id":"34508711","document":"Prof Deaton, 69, is currently professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, in New Jersey.\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said that Prof Deaton's work has transformed several fields of economics.\nMore specifically, the organisation said he had made an impact on economic theory, and on the practical application of data to investigate poverty, and devise economic policy.\nThe headline to the statement from the academy that announced that Prof Deaton was its 2015 winner said: \"Consumption, great and small\". What does this mean?\nConsumption, to an economist, means spending on goods and services by individuals and households.\nUnderstanding it means looking at how consumers allocate spending between different things, how they divide their incomes between spending and saving, and how these patterns vary over time.\nThe \"great and small\" in the academy's headline reflects Prof Deaton's analysis of consumer spending across a whole economy, and at the level of the individual and the household.\nOne theme that runs through the academy's analysis of his work is the extensive use of data on spending taken from household surveys. Previously, economists worked much more from aggregate data for the whole economy.\nThis focus enabled Prof Deaton to produce a theoretical approach that was more consistent with the fluctuations in consumer spending that he found.\nA more arcane achievement was in developing (with another economist John Muellbauer) a theory of demand for goods and services - how people allocate their spending between different products - that was motivated by problems in earlier analysis.\nTheir system, and subsequent improvements by other researchers, \"has had an immense impact in academia as well as being greatly influential in practical policy evaluation\".\nProf Deaton has been an influential figure in development economics. The academy describes him as an important driving force in the transformation of this area of economics - in moving from aggregate data to household surveys.\nTo take one example - his research shed light on the question of whether rising incomes do lead to more calories being consumed, in other words to reducing malnutrition.\nHis work suggests that it does - so encouraging economic growth can help tackle malnutrition. If that were not the case it would be an argument for reorienting policy towards direct food aid.\nIn addition to the greater recognition of his work, and the further respect of his peers, Prof Deaton receives a financial price of 8m Swedish krona ($966,000; \u00c2\u00a3630,000).\nBorn in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, Prof Deaton attended Fettes College, a private school in the city, before going on to study at Cambridge University.\nAfter teaching at Cambridge and the University of Bristol, he continued his economics career in the US.\nHe holds both British and American citizenship.\nUnlike the other five annual Nobel prizes, the economics one was not established by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, although like the Physics and Chemistry prizes it is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nInstead it was set up by Sweden's central bank in 1968 as a memorial to Mr Nobel, who died in 1896.\nIts official title is the Riksbank's Prize in Economic Sciences.","summary":"The 2015 Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to Scottish-born economist Angus Deaton."}

I fell to the ground and when he left, I ran away. Then he came back with some glass bottles and pelted me down.\"\n\"It happens a lot here in Guyana to transgender women,\" she added. \"We live in a very homophobic society.\"\nMs Trotman reported the matter to the police and the case went to Georgetown Magistrates Court.\nBut seeking justice as a transgender woman is not easy in Guyana due to a colonial-era law, now 124 years old, that criminalises cross-dressing.\nGuyanese Summary Jurisdiction Act\nOn her first day in the courtroom, Ms Trotman was told by the presiding magistrate to \"dress like a man\" at her next court date.\nWhen she returned to court on 2 March to hear the final verdict, she defiantly wore a blue top and a long, patterned skirt.\nThis time, Magistrate Dylon Bess refused her entry, citing \"inappropriate dress\".\n\"I felt really bad because the magistrate ordered me out of the court and he literally tried the case without me,\" Ms Trotman told the BBC.\nThe case was dismissed and, with Ms Trotman not allowed inside the court, she only learned of the decision when her alleged attacker shared the news upon leaving the courtroom.\nMagistrate Bess defended his demand that Ms Trotman dress in male clothes.\nHe said that while it was \"a preference and not a requirement\" that transgender women dress as men in his courtroom, \"sometimes persons commit offences dressed as males and then when they appear in court dressed as a female it can have implications for how a victim can identify his or her accuser, or vice versa\".\nHe also said that it would be up to parliament to abolish Guyana's law criminalising cross-dressing and not a court of law.\nThe managing director of Guyana's Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination (SASOD), Joel Simpson, strongly disagrees.\n\"It's really a dereliction of duty for Magistrate Bess to say that parliament has to change the law,\" he said.\n\"While he is a magistrate, not a judge, the court should not be applying an unjust, unconstitutional law... Where there's conflict, the constitution prevails.\"\nA former president of the Guyana Bar Association, Ronald Burch-Smith, also questioned the continued application of the law.\n\"There's a legitimate concern when it comes to things like crime and robbery, that persons dressed in disguise might take advantage of female clothing,\" he said.\n\"But in the [cases] that have come up so far that has never been an issue. It's taking advantage of an already oppressed minority.\n\"I think the courts should take the lead in recognising that these things are irrelevant to justice.\"\nOpposition to the cross-dressing law was sparked in 2009 when transgender activist Quincy McEwan and six others were arrested and fined for loitering and wearing female attire.\nIn protest, Ms McEwan founded Guyana Trans United (GTU) and in 2010 launched a Supreme Court challenge against the cross-dressing law, in partnership with sister organisation SASOD and the University of the West Indies' Rights Advocacy Project, U-RAP.\nWhen the case came before the court in 2013, Guyana's then-chief justice, Ian Chang, ruled that cross-dressing was legal unless done for an \"improper purpose\".\nHe did not say what constituted an improper purpose.\nSeeking clarification, Ms McEwan and her supporters took the matter to Guyana's Court of Appeal, denouncing the law as \"discriminatory\" and \"unconstitutional\".\nBut late in February they received the news that their appeal had been dismissed and Mr Chang's ruling upheld.\nAlthough frustrated with the decision, GTU and SASOD are determined to press on.\n\"Our next step is to continue to have protests, let our voices be heard and then to get a petition before parliament,\" Ms McEwan said.\n\"And we're not stopping there. We're going to appeal our matter before the Caribbean Court of Justice.\"\nIf the Caribbean Court of Justice upholds their case, Guyana will have to amend its laws. \"That's the highest court so we will have to follow the decision,\" said Attorney General Basil Williams.\nLGBT activists will likely face opposition along the way, particularly from religious pressure groups.\n\"The Church is one factor in all of this,\" said the Attorney General. \"But as time goes by everything becomes more enlightened.\"\nMs Trotman is hoping change comes soon. Without the money to appeal Magistrate Bess's decision, she said: \"I finished with the case. It's sad but what you can do? Certain laws need to be changed. It's very discriminating to us here in Guyana.

Payments have to be made in cash, and prices are a matter of negotiation.\nBy contract, Go-Jek recruits and trains its staff, who get uniforms, helmets, and a smart phone on which they manage their pick ups.\nThe company also sets standard fare levels, and provides its drivers with insurance.\nGo-Jek now has no less than 10,000 riders on its books, based not just in Jakarta, but also across the cities of Bandung and Surabaya, and the island of Bali.\nThe company makes its money by taking a 20% commission from each journey.\nMr Makarim has been a regular ojek user since his early 20s, but he admits that his childhood journeys were often a lot more luxurious.\nBorn into an affluent Indonesian family, he would be taken to primary school in Jakarta in a chauffeur-driven car.\nMr Markarim was then educated overseas, attending high schools in both New York and Singapore, before going to Brown University in the US state of Rhode Island to study international relations.\nThis was followed by getting a master of business administration degree from Harvard University in Boston.\nReturning to Indonesia to work as a management consultant in Jakarta, the idea of creating Go-Jek came to him when he was speaking with his regular ojek rider.\nMr Markarim says: \"\"I asked him, 'how long do you work?'.\n\"The ojek driver said he normally works 14 hours a day.\n\"And, I also asked him how many orders he normally took in a day. He said about four or five, so it meant that for 70% to 75% of his work hours, he's not actually working, he just sits there waiting for customers.\"\nRealising that there was a problem of supply and demand, Mr Markarim realised that developing a phone app could better connect would-be passengers with ojek riders, and via versa.\nHe also decided that passengers would like to see an increased level of trust and accountability. Therefore the app allows customers to see the distance to their destination, and calculate the exact cost of the journey.\nFor each kilometre (0.6 miles) travelled with Go-Jek, customers are charged 4,000 rupiah (29 cents; 20p).\nMr Markarim also came up with the idea of utilising Go-Jek riders as a fleet of delivery men, and even personal shoppers.\nSo instead of just using Go-Jek to transport themselves, customers can book a Go-Jek driver to collect a takeaway for them, or even do a food shop.\nMr Markarim says this gives the riders a new revenue steam, especially in times of the day when demand for passengers is low.\n\"This way, ojek drivers do not just earn money during rush hours,\" he says.\nTo launch Go-Jek Mr Markarim quit a secure full-time job. Despite having recently married at the time, he felt it was a risk worth taking.\nWith the business proving a big success so far, he is proud of what he is achieving.\n\"We only live once,\" he says. \"What do I want to tell to my grandkids about what I have done? Is it that I've made money or invented something that changed an industry forever?\n\"For me what I have been doing is a lot more than just making money. This is about what I leave as my legacy when I'm no longer around in this world.\"\nMr Markarim, who has since accepted investment from friends and other investors, now plans to expand his business operations by releasing a sister app called Go-Truk.\nGo-Truk aims to show which lorries in Jakarta have spare space, which can then be more easily hired out.","summary":"With Jakarta's traffic gridlocked in the middle of a Friday afternoon rush hour, German expat Jana Hauser thought she had little chance of catching her flight."}

James's personal story has become a tantalising fantasy for aspiring authors. But one that technology and social media are making increasingly realisable.\n\"There was a time when self-publishing was equated with vanity,\" explains John Bond, co-founder of Whitefox, one of several new companies helping 'amateur' authors publish professionally on platforms like Amazon Kindle, Google Play, Apple's iBook Store or Kobo.\n\"Because of the digital revolution, democratisation has happened. It's almost as if the writer has become his own entrepreneur around the publication process.\"\nIn their competition to get noticed, self-publishers are proving willing to take risks.\nAndy Weir's The Martian eventually went on to become a Hollywood blockbuster. But the story was originally published chapter by chapter on the author's blog for free.\nThis turned out to be great exposure and it became a huge hit as an audiobook, e-book and physical book.\n\"There was an adversarial attitude between mainstream publishing houses and self publishers a few years ago,\" says Mr Bond, \"but I think that's changed dramatically.\"\nHe attributes this to traditional publishers' new-found admiration for the self publishers' social media skills, which have helped them find new readers without the benefit of expensive marketing campaigns.\nLawyer-turned-author Mark Dawson, for example, uses his website and Facebook page to give out free copies of his thrillers and curates 'Readers' Groups'. Online conversations help him establish a closer relationship with his readers encouraging them to come back for subsequent publications.\nAnother thriller writer Joanna Penn has bolstered her following by helping others to self-publish through her website which explains how to go about self publishing.

It allows authors to retain copyright and gives them a non-exclusive deal.\nIn the US, the most mature market, independent authors are now collectively earning more from e-books than authors handled by the so-called Big Five publishers, according to advocacy website Author Earnings.\nHowever, they also charge roughly half the amount for their e-books, and there are many more of them.\nGenerous profit margins don't mean so much if you are selling cheap and struggling to sell at all in a crowded market.\nPhilip Jones, editor of The Bookseller magazine, believes it's a lot harder to make money from self-publishing now that the Kindle-inspired gold rush has petered out.\n\"Smart, entrepreneurial authors\" could use clever marketing on social media to get their e-books into the Top Ten charts, timing it to sell enough books over Christmas to make a tidy profit.\nBut that trick is harder to pull off when there are so many e-books out there, he argues.\n\"I do worry that as the market has slowed so the number of sharks willing to take money from authors has grown,\" warns Mr Jones.\n\"Publishing, when it works properly, should be about moving money towards authors.\"\nThe exact number of self-publishers and their impact on publishing is surprisingly hard to pin down.\nAmazon does not disclose its e-book sales, which are worth more than a billion dollars annually in the US alone, but remain a comparatively small part of its retail empire.\nAuthor Earnings, which scrapes public data from Amazon's bestseller lists for its analytics calculates that in the US, the amount of money spent on self-published books went up from around $510m in 2014 to $600m in 2015.\n\"E-book sales are like dark matter,\" says Michael Tamblyn, chief executive of e-book retailer, Kobo, though he is willing to volunteer some information.\n\"For us, 12% of the books we sell globally are self-published.\"\nThe fragments of available data build up a picture of a new literary landscape, where the self-published author looms large.\nFollow Dougal Shaw and Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter.","summary":"Erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey began life as a humble, self-published e-book, unable to satisfy the tastes of traditional publishers."}

Asking for him to be banned on TV is ludicrous and is akin to asking retailers to stop selling iPhones because [Apple has a] gay CEO,\" said commenter Ivan Lin.\nAs of Friday evening, both petitions were neck-to-neck with thousands of signatures each, drawing in supporters from Malaysia, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan as well.\nLambert previously performed in Singapore in 2013 to few complaints, and concerts by other artists such as Lady Gaga have generated greater controversy.\nThe debate over Lambert this time stems from a cultural divide in Singapore that has widened recently.\nA modern and open city-state with a thriving gay scene and liberal minority, much of its society also remains deeply conservative. A religious right, supported by some Christians and Muslims, has grown in tandem with a burgeoning gay rights movement.\nThe annual gay rights event Pink Dot, where supporters don pink as a message of inclusion, has sparked a counter campaign called Wear White where conservatives tog themselves in white as a symbol of purity.\nBoth sides have become more vocal in recent years, and though the conflict has not gone beyond heated debate, it has unnerved Singapore officials charged with maintaining the peace on the tiny island.\nThey have tried to strike a balance. A controversial law that bans gay sex - a key flashpoint in the divide - remains on the books, but the government has promised never to enforce it.\nAuthorities have also sought to rein in both camps by curbing their public demonstrations, in some cases refusing permits to both conservative and gay rights groups to hold or expand their public events.\nAs for Lambert, they appear to have come to a compromise.\nMediaCorp has not dropped him - but has promised that the show will conform to strict broadcast regulations and be made \"suitable for family audiences\".\nMeanwhile, Lambert has said in a statement that his performance would \"celebrate the entire human family in all its diversity\" and that he was \"a uniter, not a divider\".","summary":"A growing controversy over a Singapore concert starring openly gay US singer Adam Lambert has highlighted a widening cultural divide in the strait-laced city-state."}

It includes appeals to government ministers and could see changes to the law.\nAs well as eight \"reasonable precautions\" which could have prevented the crash - all relating to Mr Clarke's health - the sheriff outlined 19 recommendations which could reduce the chances of such an incident recurring in future.\nRead more from BBC Scotland reporter Philip Sim, who covered the inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court\nIn his report, Sheriff Becket concluded: \"The most effective measure to prevent such an occurrence would be to seek to avoid drivers becoming incapacitated at the wheel.\n\"Responsibility in that regard lies with drivers themselves and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\n\"It may well be that the single most useful outcome of this inquiry would be to raise awareness of the dangers involved in driving if subject to a medical condition which could cause the driver to lose control of a vehicle.\"\nDuring evidence at the inquiry, it emerged that Mr Clarke had suffered an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope.\nHe passed out at the wheel while the bin lorry was on Queen Street in Glasgow city centre, just days before Christmas.\nJust 19 seconds later, the vehicle came to rest against the Millennium Hotel in George Square, leaving six people dead and 17 injured.\nThose killed in the crash were Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, from Dumbarton, Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh.\nAfter hearing five weeks of evidence earlier this year, Sheriff Beckett issued a determination which identifies eight reasonable precautions which could have prevented the tragedy.\nAll relate to an earlier blackout Mr Clarke experienced at the wheel of a bus on 7 April 2010 and his subsequent failure to fully disclose his medical history.\nSheriff Beckett said Mr Clarke could have \"told the whole truth\" to his doctors about this incident, \"refrained from continuing to drive buses\" and provided \"true and accurate information about his medical history\" in later health questionnaires and assessments.\nOther precautions relate to doctors advising Mr Clarke to notify the DVLA and clarifying the circumstances of his blackout \"before concluding that he had suffered a simple faint\".\nA final precaution would have been for his then employer, bus firm First Glasgow, to have \"provided a full, accurate and fair employment reference to Glasgow City Council\".\nThe inquiry heard that the council was not made aware that Mr Clarke faced disciplinary procedures at First Bus, related to repeated sick leave, when he left First Bus.\nSheriff Beckett also made 19 recommendations which covered possible legislative changes, disclosure of medical information, the DVLA, Glasgow City Council and local authorities in general.\nOne of the most significant is for the UK transport secretary to look at whether doctors should be given greater freedom, or an obligation, to report fitness to drive concerns directly to the DVLA.\nThere is also a call for the transport secretary to consult on how best to ensure that the DVLA has the proper information to make fitness to drive licensing decisions.\nSheriff Beckett said part of this should consider increasing the penalties and altering the method of prosecution for non-disclosure.\nHis report also calls on the DVLA to provide greater clarity and guidance on how people who suffer losses of consciousness should be treated in respect of fitness to drive.\nHe also recommends the DVLA should \"change its policy\" so relevant information on fitness to drive, from third parties such as the police, could be investigated.\nSheriff Beckett also said the agency should \"redouble its efforts to raise awareness of the implications of medical conditions for fitness to drive\".\nA DVLA spokesman said: \"We are carefully considering the recommendations in the report.\"\nThe General Medical Council said vital \"lessons were learned\" from the crash.\nChief executive Niall Dickson said: \"We will be studying the report in detail and any implications for the GMC and its responsibilities.\n'The responsibility for informing the DVLA about medical conditions sits first and foremost with the patient.\n\"But doctors have responsibilities too and we are clear that they do have a vital role in helping to keep the public safe.\"","summary":"A family which lost three members in the Glasgow bin lorry crash is to go ahead with a bid to stage a private prosecution of the driver."}
{"id":"29870980","document":"I called it a circus act, a freak show. I said it had all the weird fascination of one of those Victorian Odditoriums with Wang the Human Unicorn and Ella the infamous Camel Girl. The appeal of an Old Firm derby is not so much the football but the grisliness surrounding the football.\nThat's the marketability of this game - the rot. It's not known as one of the most storied derbies in world football because of the quality of the action on the field. Maybe it was back in the day - undoubtedly it was - but that hasn't been the case for a long time now.\nThose who get drawn to it do so because of its essential madness, its toxicity, its poison. That's an uncomfortable admission given the nature of some of the things that go on around this match - the bigotry, the violence, the viciousness and hysteria on social media. But it's the truth.\nAt its craziest, it's football's equivalent of the Jim Rose Circus. And, love it or loathe it, for the next three months, there will be little escape from it.\nIt's back - or soon will be. It was inevitable. Plenty have missed it. Plenty of others have not.  It is possible to celebrate its return while also having an acute dread. That might seem like a contradiction, but in the strange world of the Old Firm, it makes some kind of sense.\nBy the time it comes around, it will have been almost three years since the previous meeting of these two clubs. Expect that to be reflected in the acreage of newsprint and radio hours that will be expended on this Scottish League Cup semi-final.\nBefore a previous meeting, I spent the week counting the number of newspaper pages given over to the fixture, from the Monday before to the Monday after. I gave up halfway through when the count had soared to over 100. One title had 27 pages dedicated to the game on one day alone. After a gap of three years, the mind boggles as to what lays ahead in terms of countdown.\nIf you stop your stopwatch at the point when it was obvious that they would be drawn together, it probably it took a fraction of a millisecond for the first tweets to land, like blows to the jaw of their rivals.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSome among the Celtic support are steadfast in their belief that a unique occurrence is going to take place next year - the first meeting of the sides.\nSomething akin to virtual spontaneous combustion happened on social media. As commentators ran through the gamut of Things We Cannot Say (TWCS), there was a predictable and plentiful response.  \"Previous meetings\" - there's been none. \"Rivalry\" - doesn't exist. \"Rangers\" - no such club.\nThis coterie of Celtic fans say they see this League Cup semi-final as a match with no history. We must assume, by extension, that they believe the Celtic crowd at Hampden for the semi-final will be no more passionate and no more desperate for success than, say, a crowd at a Celtic v Dundee United semi; that victory, if it comes, will taste no sweeter than if it was Aberdeen they were playing.\nJust another semi-final? Really? Truly?\nListening to the reaction from Celtic Park would have done nothing for those who hang on to the belief that next year's meeting will be the first of its kind. Respectfully, the very people at the heart of their own club do not agree.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the draw, Ronny Deila, the Celtic manager, spoke about the renewal of the Old Firm derby. Stefan Johansen's comments were those of a man who believes that this is a continuation rather than a beginning.\nThey're not alone. From the boardroom to the dressing-room, Celtic people have spoken in the recent past (sometimes off the record for fear of incurring the anger of some of the support) about Rangers not as a new entity but as a club they were looking forward to playing against again  - if only for the financial benefits that will come with having their ground full and their media partners salivating anew at a minimum of four Celtic v Rangers matches every season.\nIn the real world, the Old Firm rivalry lives on and we'll see it in all its dubious glory on 31 January or 1 February. It will look the same, it will sound the same. Victory and defeat will engender the same response as it always has - joy and despair on an industrial scale.\nDeila said something else when he was asked for his reaction upon hearing the draw. He said that that the game was three months away and as a result \"it's a little bit early to be talking about it.\"\nGod bless him in his innocence. Rangers manager Ally McCoist knows only too well what's coming and it's a media whirlwind the like of which Deila has never seen before in his footballing life. If he thinks his time at Celtic has been intense then it's about to build to a dizzying high.\nDeila needs to strap himself in. There's turbulence ahead.","summary":"A few years back, in the days before former owner Craig Whyte ever darkened Rangers' door and in a time when Charles Green was selling his bombast elsewhere, I wrote a column about the nature of the Old Firm derby as I saw it."}

{"id":"37628866","document":"\"I recovered from anorexia, I became bulimic and struggled with self-harm and depression and I was diagnosed with bipolar after that,\" says Ruby, who is now 22.\nThe illustrator and author, now known as Ruby etc, found herself in a cycle of hospitalisation from the age of 14, and she found each return to the classroom painfully stressful.\n\"I was too unwell for school a lot of the time and hated formal art classes in particular,\" she says, and night-school was a non-starter too.\nRuby is now building a successful career in art and has landed a publishing deal.\nAt 17 she left education and began to draw every day. At the time, it was one of the only things she could engage with and it became an important coping mechanism.\n\"When I drew it was a relief. It was catharsis,\" she says.\nHer sketches started on post-it-sized bits of paper always with the aim of making herself laugh. The \"bizarre\" nature of the mental health system provided plenty of inspiration  - from the therapists to the mood stabilisers,  which she thought of as bike stabilisers that required her to \"do the peddlin'\".\n\"Often when I'm feeling really down I'll draw very silly things to take my mind off it all. Other times I might be feeling okay, but want to focus on something a little deeper or more serious,\" she says.\nAfter encouragement from a friend, Elliot started to post her images online. Over the next three years she amassed 200,000 subscribers to her Tumblr blog, 31,000 fans on Facebook and 28,000 Instagram followers.\n\"I was so unwell and isolated but being able to put stuff on the internet and communicate with other people is something I could do from inside the house when I couldn't leave due to paranoia.\"\nElliot now takes her sketchpad everywhere she goes and regards it as her \"safety blanket\". She doesn't do draft versions of her work, she just goes straight to it in pen - generally in black ink.\nBeing depressed for me feels like I've been steam-rollered by an external force that renders me a grotty non-human pancake of sadness. I become so saturated and overwhelmed with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness that the simplest of things become a giant effort - it can take me a week or more to convince myself to crawl into the shower. The subsequent shame and embarrassment about not being able to Do Anything is the icing on the cake really. I become noticeably slower. I sleep more. It's a scary place to be.\nThe other side - mania - or hypomania (mania but without psychotic symptoms) is like a switch flicks within me and I suddenly have masses of energy; I sleep less, I do more. I can seem quite happy and 'well'. But I will have a pretty constant stream of rushing thoughts I'm trying to manage, and although they can be exciting, when I get sleep deprived I get agitated. It can get to a point where I can't 'switch off' and that gets quite dangerous and destructive.\nIn the early days she had to deal with being \"hypercritical\" of herself and describes her sketchpad as one of the only places she didn't judge herself, saying: \"It's like a separate mental space.\"\nThe healing power of art has now been formally recognised. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends art therapy as a cost-effective way of helping people with depression.\nCal Strode from the Mental Health Foundation says it offers \"expression when the emotional issues we're experiencing are too confusing or distressing to communicate with words\".\nHe says focussing on an activity calms the mind, \"occupying and holding it in the present moment where it can't dwell on the past or worry about the future\".\nHis father, Liverpool artist Steve Strode, says he too has witnessed the power of art when he worked with another group which often finds itself isolated - inmates at a prison.\n\"Although people wouldn't openly talk about feelings or emotions to keep up a front, often these things would come through in their art,\" he says. \"People in my classes would sit and meditatively paint from photographs of family members for hours.\n\"It was their escape.\"\nFor Elliot, that freedom has culminated in a book-deal which caused a five-way bidding war, for a collection of drawings and personal essays about her experiences.\n\"It was emotional digging things up and feeling them all over again, and battling with 'I'm not good enough' while trying to put this thing together and look after my health at the same time. But luckily I can sit at home and draw stuff at my desk if I don't want to go out. It has been stressful but very exciting.\"\nElliot says she aimed to write and draw about mental health in the context of the person rather than \"the stuff\" which goes with it. \"I'm quite interested in bridging that polarising gap between illness and wellness - it's the question of degree and extent,\" she says.\nHer book It's All Absolutely Fine is an irreverent look at mental health issues from anxiety to eating disorders and alienation.\nCommitting to the book project was a practice in managing her own condition and she was strict at giving herself time out. Sometimes she would work for a couple of hours, other days just 10 minutes, and she was also aware of how much social media influenced her productivity and motivation.\n\"I learned that I didn't have to post everything and I tend to steer clear of a lot of the negative stuff, but the positive response is a really great driving force,\" she says. \"I've never made it my prerogative to help people, but I'm touched and humbled when people say it's helped them.\"\nElliot who works at \"an incredibly messy desk\" at her parents' house in London or in cafes \"without the distraction of computers\" said balancing her sanctuary against her new-found job was crucial when it has been so instrumental in her recovery.\n\"I still struggle with mood episodes so I try and retain as much of the enjoyment as I can with drawing - but it can be stressful knowing you've got to produce work,\" she says.\n\"The best work happens when I'm enjoying it; because if you're playing to the audience too much, or worrying about how popular it'll be, it always ends up being less funny, less 'you'.\"\nRuby's story and pictures can be seen in her book It's All Absolutely Fine.","summary":"For Ruby Elliot her sketchbook was her only sanctuary from a life in \"constant crisis mode\"."}
{"id":"37035966","document":"Now, after nearly two years in the post, his union is involved in four simultaneous fights with four different rail companies.\nOn Southern railway and ScotRail, his members have staged strikes against plans by the train companies to run more trains on which drivers, rather than guards, operate the doors.\nThe ScotRail dispute may be nearing resolution, while the latest Southern train strikes have now been called off for talks.\nMore recently, Virgin East Coast rail workers have voted for strike action, while RMT staff on Eurostar are set to stage two walkouts this month.\nIt seems that Mr Cash has a lot on his plate at the moment. But his tactics are still the same as those he outlined to the Guardian in September 2014, shortly after taking office.\n\"We negotiate first, we seek to get deals, but if we can't, we give our members the opportunity to have their say,\" he told the newspaper.\nMr Cash has been a member of the RMT, and its predecessor the National Union of Railwaymen, for 35 years.\nHe had some big shoes to fill when he became the union's general secretary. The previous occupant of the post, Bob Crow, widely portrayed as a left-wing bogeyman and a throwback to the more militant era of the 1970s, had become the best-known trade unionist in the UK.\nIn contrast, Mr Cash, who had been Mr Crow's deputy for 12 years, was immediately labelled a \"moderate\", despite his assertions that there would be \"no deviation from the industrial, political and organising strategy mapped out by RMT under Bob's leadership\".\nMr Cash is a long-time Labour supporter who has served on the party's National Executive Committee and as a local councillor. His association with Labour has continued even after the RMT was expelled from the party in 2004, while the union itself is now affiliated to the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.\nHe has never made any secret of his view that the railways should be renationalised. He has referred to rail companies as \"parasites\" and written that \"the only answer to this continuing rail chaos is public ownership\".\nBut rail industry observers say the RMT's main objective in the current round of disputes is not a political one, merely a desire to hold back a growing tendency to hand more tasks to train drivers and reduce the role of guards.\nThis, for the union, is an issue of safety. And given the way that passenger numbers have increased and trains have lengthened in recent years, some analysts feel the RMT does have a case.\nMr Cash is a railwayman through and through, having begun work with British Rail in 1978 in the signal and telegraph department. He joined the RMT full-time in 2002.\nIn the current wave of industrial action, he has been popping up on picket lines from Glasgow to Eastbourne, always ready to denounce rail bosses for \"ripping apart the safety culture on our railways\".\nTrue, his public profile remains self-effacing, unlike that of his ebullient predecessor. But that may not matter too much, since he has held on to the big increase in membership that happened on Mr Crow's watch.\nThe RMT had just 57,000 members in 2002, but the total now stands at more than 82,000.\nWithout attracting the same attention, Mr Cash has quietly followed in Mr Crow's wake, following much the same policies.\n\"This union is in fighting shape for the battles that we know lie ahead,\" he said when he took office, and whatever the travelling public may think of the outcome, he has certainly faced those battles head on.","summary":"When Mick Cash took over as general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, he defined his approach as \"pick your fights\"."}
{"id":"36425775","document":"Traditionally a place for studios to show off what they have been working on, this year the gaming industry extravaganza has shaped up a little differently.\nPublisher EA has decided to run a separate event aimed at gamers, while rival Activision is letting the console companies promote its games, rather than having its own showcase.\n\"Usually it has been a retail show connecting publishers with buyers, but that is less relevant now due to the digital opportunities in gaming,\" said Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games at consultancy IHS Technology.\n\"But E3 still has an important role to play. It's where people learn about new products coming to market.\"\nAnd plenty of studios have capitalised on the excitement around E3 to tease their new releases, many squeezing out announcements before doors open on 14 June.\nOf course, if previous years are anything to go by, there are likely to be a few surprises during the week.\nHarvey Smith has worked on critically acclaimed games including cyberpunk role-playing adventure Deus Ex, and stealth-action thriller Dishonored, which won the Bafta award for best game in 2013.\nThe BBC asked him to share the games he's most looking forward to at E3.\nOverland\nI'm a big fan of Adam Saltsman. His game Capsule - an incredibly tense and claustrophobic space travel game - is sublime. Overland is a thoughtful, soulful, post-apocalyptic road trip game with a beautifully laconic art style. Every year, there's an indie game or two that just feels like it was made for me. This year, it might be Overland.\nLuna\nI really like Robin Hunicke's work and the art style is super cute - but it goes beyond that. I love that you're not really sure what kind of game it will be. It's the combination of looking sweet and naive on the surface, but somehow hinting at something more complex and sophisticated. I suspect it's a bit of a Trojan horse in that respect.\nNo Man's Sky\nWe play games for a variety of reasons. Some people play games to demonstrate mastery over systems; some play to marvel at a reality beyond ours; some play to feel a sense of wonder at the ecological grandeur of the world. No Man's Sky promises all of that, seducing us with unknown possibilities.\nDeus Ex: Mankind Divided\nAs one of the people to have participated in the genesis of the Deus Ex brand of dystopia, I am full of hope for the new Deus Ex game. If it's all I want it to be, it will present players with a gritty world gone wrong, challenging moral terrain, and flexible game systems that lead to improvisational \"play\" in the true sense of the word.\nState of Decay 2 (Rumoured)\nAs a fan of often nihilistic zombie fiction, I was really drawn to State of Decay. The original was a gem in the rough. The best thing about the game was the way it kept enabling player-driven stories. So many times, I got into a tight spot of my own making, then managed to get out of it through creative play. Some moments left me sweating and yelling when I got back to home base, and those moments were generally unscripted. If the new game is more polished, this could be really strong.\nRed Dead Redemption 2 (Rumoured)\nI grew up watching spaghetti westerns. They're problematic, but they occupy a mythic place in my soul. I loved Red Dead Redemption for its pacing and exploration value - watching a good western is cool, but inhabiting one is another thing entirely. I still miss my beautiful horse, killed by a pair of mountain lions, both of which I shot dead and skinned. I hope the developers took note of the stories players told after engaging with the game.\nThree short years have passed since the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Xbox One went on sale, but there is an expectation that both consoles will soon be refreshed.\nIn the past, Microsoft and Sony refined their consoles during their lifecycles with cosmetic changes and occasionally some useful upgrades such as a larger hard drive.\nBut this time round more significant changes are planned.\nSony revealed to the Financial Times on Friday that it is working on an upgraded PS4 codenamed Neo. It said it would be able to handle 4K output - four times the detail of 1080p high definition - but would not be ready to unveil at E3.\nSony added it would be more expensive than the basic version, which will continue to be made, but did not say by how much.\n\"I do not believe the new PS4 will be possible of native 4K gaming,\" commented Mr Harding-Rolls.\n\"The cost implications on both the device and content creation make this unfeasible.\n\"It is likely to support 4K video - as this is where the majority of 4K content is emerging - and will probably upscale PS4 games to 4K output.\n\"Whether this upscaling significantly improves the visuals probably depends on the game, the size of the 4K TV it is shown on and the quality of upscaling.\"\nGaming blogs have also suggested that a smaller Xbox One could be unveiled at E3.\nThe console has been criticised for being bulkier than its predecessor, although Microsoft designer Carl Ledbetter has explained the size helps keep the machine cool and allows it to run quietly.\nNintendo has already confirmed it is working on a new console - codenamed NX - but has said it will not be showing  the device at E3.\nVirtual reality was expected to steal the show at last year's E3, but despite high-profile backing from the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, gamers with VR headsets are still few and far between.\nHeadsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are finally making their way onto gamers' faces, so 2016 could be the year that blockbuster titles that attract the masses are announced.\nSony's PlayStation VR is due out in October - perhaps perfectly timed for the highly anticipated space exploration game No Man's Sky to be revealed as a launch title.\nCreator Sean Murray has said it would be a \"perfect fit\" for VR, and it has been tested in Oculus - but he has yet to reveal more.\nMicrosoft currently has no VR hardware of its own, instead focusing on its Hololens augmented reality helmet, which superimposes graphics over real-world views.\nBut the Xbox controller already works with the Oculus Rift headset, and there is speculation that Microsoft will announce a tie-up with the Oculus platform.\n\"Microsoft has been looking at an open approach to VR, inviting manufacturers to use its Windows platform to build their businesses on,\" said Mr Harding-Rolls.\n\"I think it would be a stretch to go from those ideas, to announcing an exclusive agreement to bring a particular VR headset manufacturer to Xbox One.\n\"But it has to put forward strategies to convince Xbox 360 users who haven't converted yet to upgrade.\"\nThe PS4 has pulled ahead of Xbox One in the console race, so gamers will be watching Microsoft closely for exclusives. Gaming blogs have suggested two series featuring the undead will be revived.\n\"We're expecting Dead Rising 4, and State of Decay 2 - both have performed well on the Xbox platform before,\" said Tom Phillips, deputy news editor at Eurogamer.\nSome of last year's biggest announcements - such as first-person shooter Gears of War 4, and role-playing game Scalebound - have yet to be released.\nSony too has yet to deliver on some of its previous announcements, such as The Last Guardian, a fantasy-adventure about a boy who befriends a cat-bird hybrid creature. It was first announced at E3 in 2009.\n\"The Last Guardian has achieved an almost mythical quality by this point,\" said Mr Phillips.\n\"It's finally coming out this year, so hopefully it's the last time we'll see it trailed at E3. But it does feel like when these big games do come out, they are generally well received, as with Uncharted.\n\"This year, I think we'll see Sony hand over the stage to some of the games it has tie-ins with, such as Call of Duty.\"\nThe military-inspired shooter began as a Windows game in 2003, but now offers some add-on content to PlayStation gamers first.\nIt's shaping up to be a relatively quiet E3 for Nintendo, but it is likely to attract attention with its much-delayed Legend of Zelda game, with a new quest for the young sword-wielding hero Link.\nIt is one of the bestselling series of all time, but the latest instalment has been repeatedly delayed. First announced in 2014, is now tipped to be a launch title for the NX console, and could end up being the last big home-grown game Nintendo releases for the Wii U.\nNot everything promised at E3 is successfully delivered.\nUbisoft was criticised after its 2012 demo of Watch Dogs featured superior graphics to those that appeared in the released console games.  A San Francisco-set sequel has been teased ahead of E3.\n\"First time round there was huge interest in the game, but it didn't quite live up to expectations,\" said Mr Phillips.\n\"Ubisoft has a history of having a good idea but not quite getting it right until the second release, as with Assassin's Creed.\n\"Hopefully with this sequel they have had time to refine it.\"\nSunday 12 June\nEA - 21.00 BST (13.00 PDT)\nMonday 13 June\nBethesda Softworks - 03.00 BST (Sunday 19.00 PDT)\nMicrosoft - 17.30 BST (09.30 PDT)\nPC Gaming Show - 20.00 BST (12.00 PDT)\nUbisoft - 21.00 BST (13.00 PDT)\nTuesday 14 June\nSony - 02.00 BST (Monday 18.00 PDT)\nNintendo - 17.00 BST (09.00 PDT)","summary":"This year's E3 could prove to be a turning point - not just for gaming, but for the event itself."}

In addition it can be used to accept or reject calls, and control what music is being played from the linked phone's library.\nThe company says that the watch's key innovation is its use of its proprietary Mirasol technology.\nRob Chandok, president of Qualcomm Interactive Platforms, described this as being similar to the e-ink displays commonly used by e-book readers and another smartwatch - the Pebble - but better.\n\"In addition to the fact it offers colour, the refresh rate of Mirasol can be 30 frames a second, which allows you to build a touch interface,\" he told the BBC.\n\"That's tremendously important when you are trying to offer some of these experiences.\n\"In an e-ink display you can't refresh the screen fast enough to follow the finger.\"\nMirasol is significantly less power-hungry than the OLED tech used by Samsung's Galaxy Gear watch, meaning that unlike its rival, its screen does not have to turn itself off when angled away from the user's face to extend battery life.\nSony's Smartwatch 2 does offer an always-on LCD display - however, it requires the user to switch on a backlight in dim conditions.\nAlthough Qualcomm suggests the Toq's lack of an on\/off switch makes it the superior option, Mr Chandok acknowledged that the Toq display's graphics were not as vibrant or crisp as the alternatives.\n\"But we've got other versions of Mirasol in the pipeline that are going to have a better colour gamut and vibrancy,\" he added.\nQualcomm has also included three other technologies it has developed that it hopes will attract the attention of manufacturers:\nMr Chandok said \"tens of thousands, but not hundreds of thousands\" of the watches were being produced, adding that its appeal was likely to be limited to an \"early adopter\" crowd.\n\"We would consider making more if the demand were high,\" he said. \"But our preference is for our partners to bring out products [using the new technologies] in the next six months, and we're working hard with a few people to do that.\"\nHe declined to name the companies involved, but did reveal that in theory the Toq could be made compatible with Apple's iPhones.\n\"We limited the spend on what we were doing and just built the applications on the Android side,\" he said.\n\"There's nothing keeping us from doing an iOS app, we just haven't invested in that.\"\nMany analysts believe the market in smartwatches and other wearable technologies - such as Google's Glass eyewear - has the potential for huge growth.\nThe research firm NextMarket Insights has predicted 373 million smartwatches will be shipped in 2020 compared with fewer than one million this year.\nHowever, one expert warned that Qualcomm and others had to make major improvements to achieve such numbers.\n\"They are still relatively bulky in watch terms and you still have issues with recharging, which is an alien concept to people with watches,\" said Chris Green, an analyst at the consultants Davies Murphy Group.\n\"The Toq offers a little bit more than some of the other smartwatches in terms of what it can do, but it's still ultimately a basic thing offering little more than a second screen, and is quite gimmicky.\n\"We've still to see anyone offer a smartwatch that delivers something that we actually need.\"","summary":"Qualcomm has released a smartwatch that it says can last days between recharges despite the fact its touchscreen display is always on."}

But - of course - that may all turn out to be a naively rosy expectation when the results are finally in.\nThe votes have yet to be counted, after all, and it's possible the Labour Party may end up wishing the outcome was merely painful and no worse.\nIt could just conceivably turn out to be catastrophic.\nIf this all sounds a little apocalyptic, forgive me.\nHair-rending and teeth gnashing\nDoom-laden adjectives are the stock in trade of political punditry at election time, especially when the occasion lends itself to a little hair-rending and teeth-gnashing.\nAnd there is already a not-especially-orderly queue of Jeremy Corbyn's critics in the Labour Party, waiting to blame poor results for their party on his leadership, and clearing their throats to strike up the chorus of voices wanting him to go.\nIn so far as an objective analysis exists, what would a bad night for Labour look like?\nNo main opposition party has suffered net losses of council seats for 30 years.\nThe English local council seats up for grabs were won at the height of Labour's popularity under Ed Miliband - though that's not saying a great deal. Now, losses look inevitable, and a pantheon of psephologists predict 150, 190, more?\nMr Corbyn's Labour enemies have set the bar for respectability impossibly high.\nFour hundred gains are the minimum to show progress, according to the likes of defeated leadership contender Liz Kendall, and given the fact Labour's trailing the Conservatives in the national polls, she might as well have demanded 400,000.\nIf Labour comes third in Scotland - though that's not thought very likely - or loses in London - something almost no-one expects to happen, the hair-rending and teeth-gnashing will be so frenzied as to leave the entire Labour Party, Corbynistas and anti-Corbynistas alike, bald and toothless.\nAs it is, we can expect a cacophonous set of rival choruses.

That would smack too much of treachery with a defining struggle for Britain still to be won and lost.\nWill they strike afterwards?\nWill any MP risk the certain wrath of Mr Corbyn's army of loyal supporters subsequently?\nFrom all I hear, at least two and possibly more Labour MPs of vintage and deep anti-Corbyn conviction, have told friends and colleagues that they will.\nAs of now - tonight - a challenge looks to me more than a plausible possibility. But let's see.\nRemember Michael Foot? Remember Gordon Brown at the nadir of his fortunes? Yes, Labour dumped Tony Blair, but he had a truly dedicated and ruthlessly ambitious replacement in Mr Brown (and the compromises he forced on the party grated horribly with the faithful well before Iraq). Put bluntly, Labour has always been rubbish at regicide.\nThis time, as far as I can detect, the mood is different.\nSomething damaging and conceivably dangerous for the Labour leader is about to happen. Will it end with the Labour leader's position damaged or even strengthened, at least internally?\nWith the Labour faithful, the ordinary members new and old, who elected Jeremy Corbyn in the first place in no mood to dump him, the chances of a challenge succeeding look remote. That doesn't mean the mutineers won't try.\nAs for the Conservatives, David Cameron's enjoying an easier ride than any leader of a governing party as divided as the Conservatives has any right to expect.\nSplit and bitterly fractious over Europe, some feeling rebellious over bossy and, it's argued, \"un-Conservative\" plans to force through academisation of schools and push hard for more elected mayors, the Tories really ought to be struggling, oughtn't they?\nAnd what about the continuing austerity of the chancellor's two-steps-forward-and-one-step back drive towards deficit reduction?\nThe prime minister must be offering a prayer a day in thanks for Labour's troubles.

He wanted to make some money and make our lives better.\"\nSixteen Sherpas lost their lives on 18 April in what has been described by many as modern mountaineering's deadliest single tragedy. Three of them have not been found and are presumed dead.\nSince the avalanche, more than 300 international climbers have abandoned their plans to scale Mount Everest - the world's highest mountain at 8,848m (29,029ft), which straddles the border between China and Nepal.\nNepal's tourism and mountaineering authorities have been left high and dry.\nAnita Lama, 23, is the widow of Asman Tamang, 26, who also died on the mountain.\n\"I never thought that such a tragedy would happen,\" she told the BBC, her eyes welling up as she carried her daughter, 11-month-old Dolma Tamang.\n\"He started going to the mountains for work for the past four years or so.\n\"Before the accident he said he would come back after two months. He was planning to build our own house after a couple of years.\"\nAfter the disaster struck, the Nepali government announced a compensation and insurance package worth about $15,000 (\u00a38,800) to the families of the Sherpa climbers.\nBut the families and friends of those killed were not satisfied.\nNimi Sherpa, who is a climber herself and an aunt of Phurba Ongyal Sherpa, 25, who also died in the avalanche, said the government had insulted the country's climbing community by initially announcing compensation worth merely $400 (\u00a3238).\n\"We are being treated like beggars,\" she said.\n\"We were treated miserably in the past, too, that's why many Sherpas have left the country.\"\nNepal's Himalayan Sherpa people are believed to have migrated from eastern Tibet centuries ago, and their population in Nepal currently stands at just over 112,000, according to Nepal's Population and Housing Census 2011.\nThe term \"Sherpa\" is now widely used to identify a climbing guide, and not all come from the ethnic Sherpa community of Solukhumbu, the district where Mount Everest is located.\nAccording to the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), around 9,000 Sherpas are engaged in mountaineering working as guides and climbing aides, and they make between $5,000 (\u00a33,000) and $7,000 each climbing season - several times higher than the average Nepali income.\nBut the job is fraught with risks and there is no proper official social security arrangements, senior Sherpas say, so thousands have chosen to migrate to greener pastures.\nMany have gone to America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and others to neighbouring India.\nAfter the avalanche, Nepal's tourism and mountaineering officials were unable to persuade the 300 international climbers at the Everest Base Camp to continue climbing.\n\"All climbers have packed up and left the base camp by now,\" Ang Tshering Sherpa, president of the NMA, told the BBC.\n\"But the expedition plans from the Chinese side of the mountain are on.\"\nIn recent years, Nepal's tourism ministry has been earning an annual sum of more than $3m (\u00a31.7m) from the climbers heading to Mount Everest alone.\nAfter the disaster on 18 April, officials decided to extend the permits issued this year for five years. They also announced better rescue and security measures for mountaineers.\nAs well as the security measures, the government announced education and welfare benefits for the families of those Sherpas killed.\nBut 77-year-old Nima Sherpa, who lost her youngest son, Ang Kaji Sherpa, 37, in the avalanche, is still worried that her six grandchildren may suffer.\n\"He went to the Himal [mountain] to make money, earn daily bread for the family, build a house. Now who will do that?\" she asked, as she joined prayers organised in memory of her son at a Sherpa monastery in Kathmandu.\nHer granddaughters Chhechi Sherpa, 19, and Sumi Sherpa, 15, go to school in Kathmandu, but now, after the sudden death of their father, they are worried about their future.\n\"The government must help us complete our education,\" Chhechi said. \"It must also give us facilities such as taking up government jobs.\"\nIn the weeks since the avalanche, some Sherpas at the Everest Base Camp have demanded seats in parliament and access to civil service roles such as mountain liaison officer assignments - a job assigned to mostly non-Sherpa Nepali officials until now.\nTourism Minister Bhim Acharya responded to this, saying: \"The government is serious about the demands put forth by our brave Sherpa climbers. We are doing whatever we can.\n\"But as far as a government job without the proper qualifications and education is concerned, that's not possible because we have to follow the rules and laws.\"\nWangchu Sherpa, president of Nepal Climbers Association, says it is not always fair to blame the government for all the problems facing the Sherpa community.\n\"There was no provision for compensation until a few years ago,\" he said. \"Gradually things are improving for the Sherpas. There are provisions for compensations, education and welfare. That's a good thing.\"\nShailee Basnet, a member of Nepal's all-women expedition team called Seven Summits Women Team, thinks emotions are too raw now.\n\"The Sherpas will go back to Everest again next year,\" she said. \"That's why the government and the climbing operators must ensure the technical, social and economic safety of the Sherpa climbers.\"\nAng Tshering, president of the NMA, told the BBC he welcomed the government's efforts, and said his organisation had decided to set up a separate trust worth $100,000 (\u00a360,000) for the bereaved families.\nBut he said the association was calling for the insurance package for Sherpa climbers to be increased to $2m (\u00a31.2m).\nSince the 1960s, Nepal's Sherpa community has increasingly received support from international groups.\nNew Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary, who became the first man to reach the summit of Everest in 1953 along with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, founded the Himalayan Trust in 1960, which helped to build airstrips, schools and hospitals in the Everest region. Since then other charitable individuals and organisations have followed suit.\nInternational climbers have continued to show warmth and support since last month's avalanche. Japanese climber Ken Noguchi gave $100,000 (\u00a360,000) towards the education and welfare of the deceased Sherpas' families.\n\"It's very sad that the Sherpas went to the extent of boycotting climbing expeditions this year,\" Mr Noguchi told the BBC. \"It probably reflects their long pent up anger and resentment.\n\"It's good to see the government and the mountaineering association extending support to them....

{"id":"21032595","document":"It follows proposals put forward last year in a review for an overhaul of police pay, conditions and allowances.\nThe Police Federation says it is \"disappointed\" by the announcement.\nWhat are the key changes?\nThe recommendations of the mammoth two-part Winsor Review of police pay had one simple aim: to stop paying police officers for the time they have served and start paying them for their skills and the challenges they face. In other words - the days of paying an officer more just because he had done 28 years would go.\nThe first part of the review said police were being paid under a system that had been devised for a world that no longer existed. Forces have shifted resources increasingly into specialised units. That's because (broadly speaking) expert teams - be they officers working on burglary intelligence or those who deal with child abuse - should be able to amass the knowledge needed to solve more crimes more quickly.\nWinsor said that reforming pay and conditions would help chiefs to focus resources where they were needed, while preventing some officers from seeking out the easiest of posts.\nThe second part of the review called for chiefs to be able to make officers redundant - a fundamental shift in the employment protection enjoyed by sworn officers. it also called for physical fitness tests and direct entry into senior ranks for recruits with relevant outside experience - be it military or business management skills. He also wanted accelerated promotion to inspector for the best recruits, to encourage more top graduates into policing.\nPolice pay is set through a national negotiating board - and disputes go to a arbitration tribunal.\nThere were a number of sticking points during the negotiations:\nThe government said that pay needed to be based on skills and how they were used, rather than number of years served. It said forces needed this flexibility because of the different challenges each area of the country faced. Although forces were broadly on track to make spending cuts of up to 20% by March 2015, that was not guaranteed.\nStarting salaries will be cut by up to \u00a34,259 from April, making the starting salary \u00a319,000. This salary will be given to those with the least or no relevant experience - such as those who join at 18. But some recruits will start on \u00a322,000 if they have some experience, such as time spent as a special constable. The change in starting salaries will save an estimated \u00a3140m over five years.\nBut the deal also means that many constables will have the opportunity to move to the top of the pay scale -  currently around \u00a336,000 - more quickly, .\nThe Police Federation which represents rank-and-file officers says this cut in starting salary fails to reflect the dangers inherent in the job and that police constables have lost out because of an unfair comparison between their jobs and those of other public sector workers.\nFrom April, chief constables will have discretion over whether to pay officers regional allowances. Currently, all officers in the Metropolitan and City of London police get a \"London allowance\" which amounts to an extra \u00a34,338. Officers in other forces in south-east England get an extra payment of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a33,000.\nBut in the future it will be up to the chiefs of those forces whether to continue paying that. An additional allowance in the capital, known as \"London weighting\" stays.\nAll officers from constable to chief inspector can apply for a special payment of \u00a31,212 when they reach the top of the pay grade. The idea was that it would act as an incentive for officers at the top of their scales to carry on working hard.\nThis payment for the lower ranks was introduced following a deal to give bonuses to police chiefs. But nine out of 10 eligible officers receive the payment. Critics say that means the payment has in effect become a rise for time served. From April, CRTP will be phased out, saving an estimated \u00a373m in the first year.\nConstables can't be made redundant. The Winsor Review called for chief constables to be able to get rid of officers to help them make sure they have the right mix of officers and other staff. This is a highly controversial area and negotiations will continue.\nThe Home Office has decided that there should be direct entry into some of the higher echelons of the police, rather than forcing every recruit to go through the same lengthy career that begins with being a constable. The idea is to encourage more, older, people from a range of backgrounds into the police, particularly high-flying graduates.\nThe Home Office will start a consultation soon on how direct entry will work.","summary":"The Home Secretary is implementing a range of major reforms to police pay in England and Wales after two years of tense negotiations between officers and government."}

Over the past year, the newspaper has been at the forefront of investigations into Mr Trump, and has published several editorials condemning the candidate.\nOn the news site's Right Turn blog, Jennifer Rubin says Mrs Clinton had very little to do in order to go \"the last little way in wrapping up the election\".\nShe writes that Mrs Clinton handled the audience well when answering questions, adding that the former secretary of state effectively won the debate early on by \"simply keeping her cool\".\nIssues ranging from Mr Trump's tax payments to his foreign policy have, according to the Post, given Mrs Clinton plenty of material for a new raft of political ads.\nIn a separate piece for the Post, opinion writer Eugene Joseph Dionne Jr writes that Mr Trump's \"petulant\" and \"boorish\" approach on the night was an indication of \"a man aware that his campaign was at the edge of extinction\".\n\"It took the nastiest, most bitterly personal presidential debate in recent memory for the Republican nominee to stanch the downward plunge\" - so writes Stephen Collinson for CNN.\nHe says that Mr Trump will live to fight another day \"after throwing out a battery of vicious counter punches\", while US politics \"changed in the course of one nasty night\".\nMeanwhile a CNN\/ORC poll of debate watchers handed Sunday's victory to Mrs Clinton. But the results also showed that Mr Trump managed to exceed expectations.\nMrs Clinton took the win with 57% of the vote, the poll says, while Mr Trump managed to achieve 34%. The result could be considered a disappointment for Mrs Clinton, who scored 62% in the first presidential debate.\nThe Atlantic, which endorsed Mrs Clinton last week, suggests that Mr Trump suffered an \"implosion\" in St Louis on Sunday.\nRon Fournier, whose coverage of US politics dates back to the days of Bill Clinton, writes that Mrs Clinton did about as well as anyone could while dealing with a \"barking\" opponent and \"pouting menace\".\nMr Fournier said that throughout the debate the controversial Republican \"failed to patch together his collapsing campaign\".\nThe website suggests that Mrs Clinton perfectly handled Mr Trump's comment about \"instructing my attorney general to get a special prosecutor\" to look into allegations that she deleted thousands of emails in violation of a congressional subpoena.\nMrs Clinton laughed and said it was a good thing \"somebody with Donald Trump's temperament\" doesn't have such power.\n\"Nothing hurts a bully like somebody laughing at him,\" the column says.","summary":"The US media have given their verdict on who won the second presidential debate after Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton engaged in attack and counter-attack."}

{"id":"30347441","document":"The top places are invariably filled with the US and UK academic powerhouses. And then coming up fast are the ambitious Asian universities.\nBut what about the French, with their centuries of scholarship and ancient institutions? There was a university in Paris before Oxford or Cambridge.\nFrench universities are conspicuous by their absence. In the most recent QS World University Rankings there were none in the top 20 and only two in the top 100.\nThat could all change from next year.\nAs part of a huge government-driven academic and economic project, there will be a new university called Paris-Saclay, with a campus south of the French capital. The project has initial funding of 7.5bn euros (\u00c2\u00a35.9bn) for an endowment, buildings and transport links.\nThe French government is bringing together 19 institutions into a single structure, with the aim of building a university big enough to compete with global giants like Harvard or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\nDominique Vernay, the president of this new university, says that within a decade he wants Paris-Saclay to be among the top ranking world universities.\n\"My goal is to be a top 10 institution,\" he says. In Europe, he wants Paris-Saclay to be in the \"top two or three\".\nIn university rankings, big is beautiful, and the Paris-Saclay will have 70,000 students and 10,000 researchers. There will be an emphasis on graduate courses and recruiting more international students and staff.\nMore stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch\nThe idea of bringing together individual colleges into a \"federal university\" has been borrowed from the UK.\n\"Our model isn't that far from the Oxbridge model,\" he says.\nTo put it into scale, Mr Vernay says Paris-Saclay is going to be twice the size of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the flagships of the US university system.\nWithout any extra investment, he says that the existing component parts of the university will put Paris-Saclay straight into the top 20 of the Shanghai global university rankings.\nIt will inherit staff with Nobel Prizes and some very well-established founding partners, including the Ecole Polytechnique, the HEC Paris business school and the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).\nGetting into the top end of the league tables is not the purpose of the investment, he says. But it would be an important indicator of how France can create a much more concentrated and globally competitive research base.\nThe big idea is to create a \"knowledge hub\" around Paris, bringing together top-level universities with research institutes, hi-tech businesses and start-ups.\nThe classic example of such a project would be Silicon Valley in California where Stanford University has been the launchpad for firms such as Google and Hewlett Packard.\nBoston would be seen as another such hi-tech cluster, with Harvard and MIT feeding ideas into technology firms. In London, Imperial College and University College London are planning expansions to tap into this drive for innovation.\nBut in this industrial geography of the internet age, with the emergence of these academic-industrial complexes, Paris has been falling behind.\n\"The essence of the plan is that we are missing growth in France. It's not the big companies, what we're missing is the new technology, those small companies that grow very fast and become new players,\" said Mr Vernay.\n\"We need to strengthen the links with industry, strengthen our ability to launch start-ups.\"\nThe president says that the Paris-Saclay project should be seen as part of the next great historic wave of French higher education.\nThe grand ecole that produced the scientists and administrators for Napoleon's empire were very successful specialist institutions. And investment after World War Two supported more research in specialist areas, such as nuclear power.\nBut Mr Vernay says they have been too small, too disparate and lacking in co-ordination to compete in the modern, globalised economy.\nHe likens it to a \"French garden\", with different types of flowers growing in splendid isolation.\n\"There is a very fragmented landscape. We want to re-group institutions so that they can run as a single organisation, in terms of strategy, research and training.\"\nAnother barrier to overcome has been the past reluctance to use anything except the French language.\nThe common language of higher education, particularly in the sciences, has increasingly become English.\n\"I am very pragmatic,\" he says. That now means that Paris-Saclay will be offering master's courses fully taught in English as well as French.\n\"It's not only allowed, it's now encouraged to teach in English.\"\nFrom next year, degrees from the constituent colleges will begin to be awarded by Paris-Saclay.\nPreparing the 1,300-acre campus, he says is like organising the building of a town. The Paris metro is being extended, linking the university with the city and Orly airport.\nIn some ways it's a very French response to globalisation.\nParis-Saclay will be part of a chain of centrally planned, academic \"grand projets\", fast-tracking research in the way that a generation ago France was building high-speed railways or the monumental architectural projects in Paris.\nThe ambition is about safeguarding an uncertain future for France.\n\"We want to give something back to our country. We are in an economic war,\" says Mr Vernay.","summary":"Imagine the chagrin of French universities whenever international rankings are published."}

We showed some resilience.\n\"Some of the link-up play and finishing was pretty special. Cammy's composure and movement for the goals was outstanding, he has done really well since coming in on loan. I am delighted for him.\n\"There were huge positives all over. Young left-back Jamie Robson was outstanding, Scott Fraser was outstanding, Blair Spittal was excellent and Tope Obadeyi playing as a lone striker was fantastic.\"\nUnited hat-trick hero Cammy Smith: \"The standard has been set after that.

an investigation into undercover policing at the Metropolitan Police - has unearthed \"serious historical failings\" in undercover policing practices.\nMr Ellison - who in 2012 successfully prosecuted Gary Dobson and David Norris for the murder of teenager Stephen Lawrence - has been examining police corruption during the original investigation into the killing in 1993.\nShe added: \"As I said last year, I was profoundly shocked by Mark Ellison's findings and committed to establishing a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the SDS.\n\"While I initially said that Mark Ellison's further work and criminal investigations needed to conclude before the inquiry commences, it has become apparent that these pieces of work were much larger than initially envisaged.\n\"In the interest of learning the lessons of past failures, I have decided to establish the inquiry now while ensuring existing work is not affected.\n\"Undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future.\"\nThis latest inquiry will be led by judge Lord Justice Pitchford.\nMrs May had announced her intention to set up a judge-led public inquiry following the report of the independent Ellison Inquiry in March last year.\nThat had found Scotland Yard spied on Stephen Lawrence's family.\nAnd Operation Herne found that the SDS had carried out undercover operations to gather information on 18 justice campaigns over 35 years.\nThis included the campaign regarding Jean Charles de Menezes, shot by police after being mistaken for a terrorist in the days following the London Underground bombings in 2005.\nThe SDS was set up in 1968 to infiltrate pressure groups and remained operational until 2008.\nIt has been the focus of controversy over claims that some undercover officers had sexual relationships and fathered children with campaigners, to help build trust in their false identities.\nChief Constable Mick Creedon of the Association of Chief Police Officers said: \"Undercover policing is a vital police tactic has saved lives, protected victims and brought dangerous criminals to justice.\"\nHe also said that the public inquiry would help make sure that the \"unacceptable behaviour of some officers in the past never happens again\".\n\"Changes have already been made to the authorisation and management of these operations.\n\"New training and guidance for undercover officers guidance developed with the College of Policing reinforces the need for them to meet the highest ethical standards.\"\nThe allegations about the SDS include that its officers worked to discover information about the Lawrence family, which could be used to smear them following Stephen Lawrence's death.\nHis father, Neville, said he would like to be fully involved in the inquiry.\nHe added: \"I've always felt that my family were under greater investigation than those guilty of killing my beloved Stephen and so it is only natural to want to discover what was really going on.\"\nJules Carey, of Bindmans solicitors, which represents the woman known as \"Jacqui\" who had a child with an undercover officer, said: \"For the inquiry to fulfil its purpose of restoring public confidence it will be vital to ensure that there is proper consultation with all interested parties in the framing of the terms of reference for the inquiry.\"\nShe also said that the inquiry must be \"conducted in an open manner that allows those affected by spying to question the undercover officers and those who responsible for their deployment\".\nMeanwhile, Mrs May has also published an independent review of the Home Office's knowledge of SDS activities, commissioned in March last year and conducted by Stephen Taylor, former director at the Audit Commission.\nMr Taylor said it was not possible to say if a missing file regarding SDS, which would have included documents classified as \"secret\" and \"top secret\", was due to \"human error or deliberate concealment\".\nMr Taylor also said that \"given the absence of documents and the passage of time\" he could not rule out the possibility that \"an individual or individuals within the Home Office\" may have been aware of:","summary":"An inquiry into undercover policing and the operation of the Metropolitan Police's Special Demonstration Squad is being established by Home Secretary Theresa May."}

{"id":"35546399","document":"A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth.\nThe proposal to allow abortion in such cases was defeated by 59 votes to 40.\nThe result followed a passionate debate at Stormont after some MLAs proposed the law change be introduced by way of an amendment to the Justice Bill.\nUnlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland.\nCurrently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.\nPoliticians have been lobbied to reform the law since 2013, when Northern Ireland woman Sarah Ewart spoke out about having to travel to Great Britain for an abortion after she was told she was carrying a baby that had no chance of survival.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) faced criticism from other parties during Wednesday's debate for asking the Health Minister Simon Hamilton to set up a working group to examine the issues raised by fatal foetal abnormality.\nIt could take six months for the group to complete its work and the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt claimed it was a DUP \"device\" to delay decision making on abortion reform until after May's assembly election.\nJustice Minister David Ford, who brought forward the proposed change to the legislation, told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show it could now remain in limbo for some time.\n\"It would appear that that is what some people want, that it was any excuse at all to avoid taking a decision last night so they can fudge the issue,\" he said.\n\"We will wait and see what happens to the DUP's supposed working group for the next six months. Certainly, we'll get the DUP past the election, maybe that's why they're doing it.\"\nHowever, the DUP has argued that the issue required proper consideration by MLAs and ministers and that the Justice Bill was not intended for this purpose.\nThe amendment to legalise abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality was proposed by Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson.\nHe told MLAs: \"If we are to continue to fail women in Northern Ireland in this area then we are abdicating our duties as representatives.\n\"The traumatic journey to England for many young women is becoming a shame on Northern Ireland and to force women with a fatal foetal pregnancy to look elsewhere for help and support make this worse.\"\nThe amendment relating to pregnancies which are the result of rape or incest was put forward by Anna Lo, also of the Alliance Party, and was defeated by by 64 votes to 30.\nMr Nesbitt said that as a man he did not feel comfortable \"discussing what a woman should do with her body\" but he added that MLAs had a responsibility to legislate.\nHe claimed the DUP's request for a commission was a delaying tactic designed to \"kick the decision to the far side of the election\".\nMr Nesbitt described the delay as \"cruel\" and \"Dickensian\".\n\"This is Bleak House we're in today, in the Chancery courts waiting day after day, after day, after day for a decision that never comes,\" he said.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Caitr\u00edona Ruane also criticised the DUP for \"supporting a commission which will report in six months\".\n\"What about the plight of women in the here and now? What about the women who are pregnant as the result of rape, or women who are faced with fatal foetal abnormalities?\n\"Is the DUP going to tell them 'we're having a commission in six months and sure, then we'll see where is goes?'  I'm sorry, long-fingering this does a disservice to women,\" Ms Ruane said.\nHowever, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MLAs expressed doubt that doctors could accurately predict that an unborn child had no chance of survival.\nSDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said clinicians had told her party that \"there is no such definition\" as fatal foetal abnormality.\nSpeaking independently from her party, Alliance MLA Anna Lo proposed that women who have become pregnant as a result of sexual crime should have access to a legal abortion in Northern Ireland.\nMs Lo said that forcing pregnant rape victims to give birth meant they would be \"reminded every day of that act of violence which was forced upon her\".\nHowever, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister described Ms Lo's amendment as a  \"charter for abortion on demand\".\nHe said that because of his background as a barrister he had more experience than most MLAs of rape trials and added that \"95% of the time, the question for the jury is - was the sexual intercourse consensual or not?\"\n\"All you have to do is to allege indecent assault it seems, rape, and you're entitled on the nod of a medical practitioner to abortion,\" he said.\nMr Allister told MLAs that allegations of rape could only be proven through \"due process\" and this was not possible within the timeframe of pregnancy.\nDUP MLA Emma Pengelly spoke in support of the working group on fatal foetal abnormality.\n\"I have not had the beautiful privilege to have brought a child into this world but I can empathise with all my heart that the wished for, the longed for, can turn so quickly to tragedy,\" she said.\n\"The way forward that we are proposing is a compassionate one, it is a sensible one, it is a common sense one that will leave all of us in a much better and informed position to chart a loving and kind way forward.\"\nAt the end of the debate, Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin commended MLAs on the \"sense of dignity\" they displayed during the discussions.\nStormont's chief legal adviser, Attorney General John Larkin QC, is among those who are opposed to changing the law and has outlined concerns that the move could breach obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).\nPrecious Life, one of the largest pro life organisations in the region vowed to \"expose\" any MLA who voted in favour of the new legislation.\nAmnesty International said failing to reform the law would be a \"betrayal of women\", while the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission urged political action.","summary":"Northern Ireland Assembly members have voted against legalising abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality."}

{"id":"33735160","document":"But does the fate of Greece matter to the wider world? Does it matter if Greece eventually leaves the eurozone, or even the European Union?\nThe short answer is yes. Most people care about the fate of Greece, and hope that it can maintain stability and feel secure.\nMany people, but by no means all, believe that its membership of \"Club Europe\" is one guarantee of a stability which has so often been denied to Greece in the past.\nFor at least the past hundred years, Greece has swung between democracy and dictatorship, between civilian and military rule, and the outside world would like to be sure the pendulum now stays firmly in the position marked \"democratic, civilian government\".\nBoth history and geography help explain why Greece matters far beyond its borders.\nThe society which gave the world the embryo of modern democracy in Ancient Greece has only enjoyed 40 years of continuous parliamentary democracy in modern times. The days of the \"Greek colonels\" are still in the not-very-distant past. The last military regime in Athens was overthrown in 1974.\nThirty years earlier, in 1944, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, as uncomfortable wartime allies against the Nazis, were carving up the Balkans between East and West for the post-war era. In Moscow, Churchill put it to Stalin: \"Let us settle about our affairs in the Balkans.\"\nBritain's wartime leader wrote down his proposals in pencil on a sheet of paper:\nA couple of later additions and amendments in red ink are important.\nThe Greece section is changed so that \"the others 10%\" becomes \"Russia 10%\".\nAnd after Great Britain's claim to 90% influence has been added the words \"in accord with USA\", recognising where the real post-war power would lie.\nIt was part of the far larger, so-called \"percentages agreement\" attempting to parcel out Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Hungary too. There's a blue pencil tick near the top of the page, apparently in Stalin's hand.\nHe may have honoured that limit to his influence in Greece, but certainly not his apparent agreement to share Hungary and Bulgaria.\nAfter that, Churchill moved very swiftly to try to ensure that the Greek Communists - who had been such a strong force in the divided Resistance to Nazi occupation - would not prevail.\nHe made a dangerous flight to Athens on Christmas Day, 1944, and on 26 December posed with the Greek Orthodox Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens.\nChurchill backed him as regent, or temporary head of state, ahead of Greece's descent into the nightmare of civil war between communists and anti-communists.\nThat civil war is called by some the first battle of the Cold War.\nIf you accept that another contest for influence between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the West is now under way, it's not hard to see why anything like \"Grexit\", which would detach Greece from the inner core of EU states, alarms not just fellow European leaders, but also the United States.\nPresident Putin has been courting the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras. It's true that the Russian leader has offered only limited financial support.\nBut some experts see real opportunities for Russia either way: if the Greek marriage to the EU were to end in a messy divorce or if Greece stays in but continues to hedge its bets through friendship with Moscow.\nThe most imaginative commentators even suggest that if Greece left the EU it would then be bankrolled by Moscow in exchange for Greek agreement to resign from Nato as well, allowing Russian warships to sail unhindered through Greek waters into the Mediterranean.\nEven if that seems far-fetched, there's little doubt Mr Putin would see himself as the winner if Greece became either semi-detached or wholly detached from the European Union and perhaps permanently destabilised. Anything which hurts the European Union can look like an advance seen from the Kremlin.\nA brief look at an atlas reminds us why Churchill wanted to be sure of Greece.\nGreek territory controls a huge area at the north-eastern corner of the Mediterranean. Its territory includes several hundred islands in the Aegean, Ionian and Mediterranean Seas.\nGreece forms the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula.\nIt is the cornerstone of south-eastern Europe, even if Cyprus is now the furthest outpost of the EU in that direction.\nIt didn't take very long after the restoration of democracy to Greece in 1974 for the country to be welcomed into the European Union in 1981.\nThat was meant to be a decisive turning point, cementing Greece into political and social stability.\nWhen the question of Greece joining was debated in the House of Commons in 1979, one of the senior Foreign Office ministers in Margaret Thatcher's first government, the Lord Privy Seal, Sir Ian Gilmour, spoke approvingly of: \"...the political significance of accession, the endorsement which it represents of Greece's democratic progress and of her decisive orientation towards Western Europe. But economically, too, accession will be of great importance to Greece. It will be a challenge and an opportunity.\"\nGreece's membership has certainly proved to be a challenge as well as an opportunity.\n1941: Greece falls to Germany in World War Two.\n1944: British and Greek forces combine to force Nazi withdrawal.

{"id":"32229796","document":"Two days later Hyundai Trajet Y264 TKP is shunted into a Cornish garage, and declared by the owner George to be \"finished\".\nOr in the words of the recycling industry, it has become an end-of-life vehicle.\nHere rusty hulks lie forlornly in a line waiting for scrap - after hundreds of thousands of miles of family holidays, car-sick children, back-seat driving, wasp-rich picnics and school runs.\nRemembering the car was 12 years old, I chirpily mention that a \u00a3150 cheque from a scrap merchant would come in handy.\n\"\u00a3150? Lucky to get \u00a350,\" says George.\nGeorge sits in his office outside the tiny Cornish village of Doublebois and patiently explains the macroeconomic forces at play that have reduced my car to a hunk of worthless metal.\nChina, he reckons, is the problem. With Chinese demand falling, the price of iron ore is on the way down and scrap metal prices are following in their wake.\nA year ago George could have got \u00a3160 for my car.  During the Beijing Olympics prices skyrocketed.\nNot now. \"There's a worldwide glut of metal,\" he explains.\nAnd Y264 TKP is 75% metal, albeit dented and scratched by bike racks, my mother's gate post and, for reasons too complex to go into, the teeth of a small pony.\nThere are other problems too - the collapse in demand, unsurprisingly, from Ukraine, and the eurozone recession.\nOne insider put it bluntly: \"The business is bloody painful\".\nCharles Ambrose of the UK's Motor Vehicle Dismantlers' Association (MVDA) said: \"In the last few years we've lost 30 members or so going out of business. Most of them are long term players. They are being kicked from all sides.\"\nGeorge will bear away poor crippled Y264 TKP to be eviscerated in an \"authorised treatment facility\". It will be \"de-polluted\", the battery, and tyres removed, the diesel, oils, and brake fluids sucked out.\nThe oils will be re-refined or used as fuel. The battery will be ground down, the acid neutralised, the polymers separated from the lead, to go towards making a new one.\nOf course, I could bypass George altogether and get a little more - cash in hand - from someone, er, less respectable.\nThe MVDA believes 600,000 of the 1.7 million cars scrapped every year simply fall off the official radar, unregistered, untaxed. The paper trail vanishes into a black hole, or rather a black market.\nEnvironmental niceties are not observed on the black market.\nBut the expense of putting anything in a landfill in the UK and the difficulty of dumping cars means even the vanished ones work their way back into the recycling system.\n\"It's hard to know exactly where those cars go,\" says Mr Ambrose. \"We know a tremendous number are broken up and the parts end up on eBay.\n\"Others are exported as whole cars or as spare parts. Parts of your car could end up in a vehicle in Nigeria. That's not a problem environmentally. It's still recycling.\n\"But the money involved in this kind of black market is often also involved in crime.\"\nSo one way or another almost 95% of Y264 TKP will be recycled. The UK is expected to hit the 95% car recycling target set by the European Union's end-of-life vehicle directive this year or next.\nWhich is why the plastic bits of Y264 TKP, like the cup-holders stuffed with my daughters' hair-ties, will not go to landfill.\nThe legislation has forced industry to come up with recycling solutions - at a cost.\nIan Hetherington, director general of the British Metals Recycling Association says: \"The capital expenditure to develop this kind of technology is very high indeed, and it is only profitable when you are producing very high quality plastics at the end of it.\"\nSo the American firm MBA Polymers invested $30m (\u00a320m) to develop technology to recycle high grade plastics.\nIts joint venture with the UK's European Metal Recycling (EMR) in Worksop recycles 80,000 tonnes of plastic every year. The plastic pellets are then sold to manufacturers.\nThe alarming truth is the plastic trim of Y264 TKP, which the dog did such appalling things to on the way home from Scotland in 2008, could end up as part of a Nespresso coffee machine.\nBut plastic, like metal, is subject to market prices. It is the low oil price this time. Cheap oil makes \"virgin\" plastic cheaper, so while the law insists on recycling, the margins for the recycled stuff are squeezed.\nThen there is the fluff - the padding, the upholstery, and probably the shoe my son lost in 2007. Technically it is ASR, or automobile shredder residue. There is a good chance it will go to landfill.\nBut there is also a chance it may go through another innovation - a new energy-from-waste plant in Oldbury, in the West Midlands where Chinook Sciences and EMR will turn it into electricity to be sold into the grid.\nThe grubby left over bits of Y264 TKP will then power, say, my washing machine.\nFinally there's the metal - the easy bit, even if its value is small.\nY264 TKP, replete with my memories, will go into a crusher, something like the Red Giant made by the New York firm Hammel, or perhaps even the monstrous Hammel 1500DK  that will devour a car body in around 20 seconds.\nThe parts are then separated, using magnets and flotation tanks to divide materials according to their atomic weights.\nThis is the law of the scrap dealer: Separation creates value.\nThere are precious metals to be had: rhodium, palladium and platinum, and rare earth metals, once discarded, now picked clean from mirrors, batteries and catalytic converters.\nSome call it \"Urban Mining\".\nOne recycling expert described it thus: \"The iron ore miners take the stuff from below the ground, we just take it from above the ground.\"\nThe steel will probably go abroad for smelting. Scrap is best suited for electric arc-furnaces rather than blast furnaces, and the most convenient ones are in southern Europe. Turkey is the favoured destination.\nFrom there, the metamorphosed chassis of Y264 TKP, possibly still tainted with the last few grains of sand from a Norfolk beach holiday, is likely to end up as a small (but I like to think important) part of the frame of a middle eastern skyscraper.\nIan Hetherington adds a final suggestion: \"It may though actually go back to South Korea.\n\"It could even turn into another Hyundai.\"","summary":"A few miles short of Swindon my car, laden with four teenagers, my wife, one teenager's boyfriend, a dog, and attendant baggage comes to a sudden and it turns out, permanent, halt."}

He was jailed for nine years and six months.\nJailing Ferris at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Turnbull told him: \"Your behaviour on that evening, when seen in the context of your previous offending, demonstrates you have no sense of the civilised values by which others in our community live their lives.\"\nLord Turnbull said Mrs Carson had been a mother and wife \"in the prime of her life\" who, through the random timing of taking her dog for a walk, found herself in the path of a drunk driver travelling at excessive speed.\nHe said the author of a background report on Ferris could \"detect little by way insight or genuine remorse\" on his part.\n\"The consequence of your conduct was predictable, but it was also truly tragic for Mrs Carson and her family,\" he said.\nA previous hearing at the High Court in Glasgow was told that on the day of the crash Ferris had been drinking Buckfast and was \"pretty drunk\".\nAt about 20:00, Mrs Carson left her home in Gresham View, Motherwell, to walk the family dog.\nFerris was seen driving the Mondeo at excessive speed, causing some witnesses to remark that he was \"flying past\" and driving \"like an idiot\".\nHe then lost control on Muirhouse Road, causing the car to mount the pavement, hit Mrs Carson and then smash into a wall.\nAfterwards, Ferris got out of the car and spoke to Mrs Carson who was lying on the pavement.\nWhat he said was not heard, but a bystander then saw him put his hands to his head and shout before running from the scene.\nOne of the people who tried to help Mrs Carson called the mobile number on the dog's collar and spoke to 47-year-old Mr Carson.\nHe then rushed to the scene with their 11-year-old daughter and both were comforted by locals while a nurse attempted CPR on Mrs Carson until paramedics arrived.\nThe court was told that Mrs Carson died from multiple injuries.\nFerris was later seen dropping car keys from the window of his flat at Grange Tower, before police arrived and forced entry.\nWhen he saw them he became aggressive, told them to leave and denied that he had been driving.\nA breath test carried out on Ferris 90 minutes after the crash gave a reading of 63mcgs. The legal limit is 22mcgs.\nPolice experts who examined the crash scene concluded that blame for the fatal collision lay with Ferris who drove at an inappropriate speed in a 30mph limit area, under the influence of alcohol and failed to negotiate a right-hand bend.\nSpeaking after sentencing, Insp Darren Faulds, of Police Scotland, said: \"Ferris, despite having already been banned from the road for a previous conviction, took the decision to get behind the wheel of that vehicle whilst under the influence of alcohol, and in doing so, had absolutely no regard for the safety of any pedestrians or other motorists in his path.\n\"Following the fatal crash, in an act of cowardice, he fled from the scene and tried to cover his tracks before being traced and arrested.\"","summary":"A man with two previous drink-driving convictions has been jailed for killing a woman in a crash while he was over the limit and flouting a driving ban."}
{"id":"22556638","document":"\"By the time you're 40 years old, you've learned a great deal, both professionally and personally, and made a lot of mistakes. And I think respect comes with age - people take you more seriously.\"\nIt certainly worked for Johnson. It was as she was turning 40 that she set up the San Francisco-based product design company, Coupage, with her engineer husband. Business has been booming ever since.\nShe is not alone, it seems. Many women entrepreneurs are waiting for the right moment, and are starting their businesses in their forties or beyond - as a second or even third career - having bided their time until they are absolutely ready.\nHaving worked in product design and then in advertising, Raquel Johnson realised that she did not want to return to the corporate world after she had her younger daughter.\nIt was challenging walking away from the \"sure thing\" of a steady salary, she says, but she also found it liberating. She has found her \"true passion,\" she says.\n\"Even the stress I feel now is more enjoyable,\" she explains cheerfully. \"It motivates me and pushes me forward.\"\nStarting small, the business was run from home and was self-funded at first.\n\"[When you are older] there is more opportunity for some savings to have accumulated,\" points out Johnson. \"You don't have to take out large loans or search for funders right away.\"\nHaving started with a prototype for a device to integrate an iPod into a car, Coupage has grown steadily, bringing ideas to life in the fields of audio, energy, cars and Apple-related products.\n\"Once you reach your forties you have the confidence to follow your own path,\" says the US-born businesswoman, Karen Scofield, who set up her company when she was 46.\nA sense of humour is also important, she adds with a smile. In the early days, she had to run her firm, London-based fashion brand Lucza, single-handedly.\nIt was all down to her, from technology mishaps and admin dramas to sudden, urgent errands, like dashing out to the shop to buy a copier cartridge. \"Humour was definitely needed on that day,\" she laughs.\nAll of which is a far cry from her previous career as a television executive in New York, working for a smooth-running corporate machine.\nWhen she moved to London with her husband and started a family, it was time to think again.\nBut the skills she had learnt in TV - time and people management, organisation, as well as research and analysis - were highly transferable, she says: Some things, however, she is doing very differently from her old workplace.\nHer leadership style at Lucza is \"inclusive,\" she says.\n\"But the main difference is, now you are the boss, the final decision maker, which can be daunting.\n\"You decide what is best and you must make these decisions with confidence.\" It is something she relishes.\nSo what advice would Karen Scofield give to other entrepreneurs when the going gets tough? \"You have to push yourself forward, set your own deadlines and keep going.\"\nThe hard work and \"long nights\" have been worth it, she says. The Lucza brand has been increasing year-on-year sales and its pieces are worn by high-profile women such as Samantha Cameron, wife of the British Prime Minister.\nShe loves that her daughters see her doing something \"new and scary,\" and adds, \"I do think it's incredibly important that women support other women, however and whenever possible.\"\nShe praises The Next Women, an organisation which connects women entrepreneurs via networking events and conducts \"pitch events\" to prepare female entrepreneurs for fundraising pitches. Raquel Johnson found Women 2.0, which champions female tech entrepreneurs, an invaluable support\nNew groups are increasingly popping up such as the fledgling UK-based organisation My Next Day Job, which is collaborating with Prime, the Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise.\nWhatever the support, however, taking this path more than half way through your working life takes confidence and bravery.\nSarah Weck of Hidden Springs Maple  - a maple syrup farm, retail website and wholesale business - was emboldened by the opportunities she saw in the market. It was too good to miss.\n\"Having worked in Silicon Valley I saw how retail was changing, but when I was still in my thirties the market would not have been ready for my business,\" she says.\nThe maple syrup farming business had been in her husband's family for more than 50 years, but it was Weck who, at the age of 42, decided to combine old-style Vermont with high-tech California, and sell their syrup online.\nShe now runs the whole operation, from bookkeeping and marketing, to payroll and even scooping ice cream at the farm shop. Her hard work has paid off - the company now has 10 employees, and sales are doubling each year.\nAnd how does gender fit in? There are barriers, she concedes.\n\"As a woman, you have to make people take you seriously. Men are more prevalent in business, and women have to work at changing the image of business to be gender neutral.\"\nBut, she adds, bias can be overcome. \"I've watched people shift attitudes,\" she says.\nIn the early days she was overcharged for supplies, until she proved she had researched the supply-and-demand economics for that particular season. \"I'm not sure a man would have had to prove himself in the way I did.\"\nAs for her age, Weck sees it as a definite advantage. She draws on skills she learnt in her previous two careers (she was an English teacher and then a technical writer for a software company), such as leadership and attention to detail.\n\"I know myself and my strengths and limitations so much better than I did in my twenties and thirties.\"\nNever a better time than in your forties, seems to be the consensus.\nAs Raquel Johnson of Coupage puts it: \"Being comfortable in my skin has helped me be much more successful now than when I was younger and more unsure of myself. Recognising when the time is right, and seizing the opportunity is absolutely key to success.\"","summary":"\"Timing is everything,\" says entrepreneur Raquel Johnson."}
{"id":"40402184","document":"DUP leader Arlene Foster said the \"wide-ranging\" pact was \"good for Northern Ireland and the UK\" -  so where will the money be spent?\nThe heart of the financial package is infrastructure spending - \u00a3400m of it over two years.\nThat is a significant sum given that Northern Ireland's annual infrastructure budget is about \u00a31bn.\nThe deal specifically mentions the York Street Interchange, a project to ease congestion where three major roads meet in Belfast.\nIt is expected to cost about \u00a3150m, so there should be plenty left over for other major projects.\nThey could include a planned transport hub in the centre of Belfast and other major roads schemes like the completion of the A5 or A6.\nOn top of the \u00a3400m, there is a further \u00a3150m for ultra-fast broadband.\nThis was a project which was already being scoped by the Department of the Economy before the collapse of Stormont.\nIt is ultimately about improving the connectivity of rural businesses.\nPrevious Stormont\/Westminster deals have also included infrastructure but they typically involved allowing Stormont to borrow more.\nThis time it is cold, hard, no-strings-attached cash.\nThe money for health and education is more modest - given that a figure of \u00a31bn for health alone was being mentioned during the negotiations.\nThere is a minimum of \u00a3250m for health and and we can assume it will get about half the \"immediate pressures\" money, bringing it to a total of \u00a3300m.\nThat will help ease the problems with waiting lists and give the system some breathing space ahead of a major reform programme.\nThe \"immediate pressures\" money for education (about \u00a350m) will go some way to easing a growing row with head teachers who have said they will not impose any more cuts.\nThere is also \u00a3100m to be spent on deprived communities over five years.\nIt will be interesting to see what the delivery mechanism for that money will be.\nStormont's Social Investment Fund, which was also designed to help those communities, has been mired in controversy.\nAnother part of this deal is to give flexibility to a previously agreed \u00a3500m fund for investment in shared education and housing projects.\nStormont has struggled to spend this money, in its first year just \u00a33m of a \u00a350m allocation was spent.\nSo its is possible that the new flexibility will allow all that money to go into general infrastructure spending.","summary":"Northern Ireland will receive an extra \u00a31bn over the next two years as part of the deal that will see the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs back Theresa May's minority government in Commons votes."}

{"id":"39425724","document":"The screens of the Galaxy S8 and bigger S8+ are also larger despite the devices being about the same size as last year's S7 and S7 Edge.\nThis time, both models feature displays that curve round the phones' sides.\nThe launch follows Samsung's botched release of the Note 7, which was recalled twice after fires.\nThe South Korean firm blamed the problem on battery faults and said it had since put in additional safety measures, including X-ray scans of  batteries.\nThe company has also become mired in a corruption scandal in its home country.\n\"The Galaxy S8 is arguably the most important launch of the last 10 years for Samsung and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note 7 recall,\" commented Ben Wood from the CCS tech consultancy.\n\"The S8 is a unquestionably a strong product but Samsung must now deliver a faultless launch to move on from its earlier difficulties. If this happens it will emerge in an even stronger position.\"\nThe new devices will be released on 21 April.\nThe S8 is priced at \u00a3690 and the S8+ at \u00a3780 - a jump on last year's entry prices of \u00a3569 for the S7 and \u00a3639 for the S7 Edge.\nSamsung was the bestselling handset manufacturer for 2016 as a whole, according to market research firm IDC.\nHowever, Apple overtook it in the final three months.\nSource: IDC\nThe displays of the S8 and S8+, measuring 5.8in (14.7cm) and 6.2in (15.7cm) respectively, mean a more stretched aspect ratio than before, pushing the screens closer to the top and bottom of the handsets.\nAs a consequence, Samsung's logo no longer features on the front, and the physical home button is replaced with an on-screen icon - in a similar manner to rival Android phones from Huawei and LG.\nA pressure sensor and vibration module have, however, been built into the space behind the new virtual button to provide feedback.\nSamsung suggests the displays' 18.5:9 ratio makes them better suited to running two apps side by side. For example, there is now space to watch a video, use a chat app and still have room for a full touch-keyboard.\nThe screens are the same resolution as before but are now brighter, supporting high dynamic range (HDR) playback of videos for extra clarity.\nThe S8's body is a little narrower than that of the S7, while the S8+'s is a bit wider than the S7 Edge but lighter - Samsung says both new devices can still be used one-handed.\nThe phones also introduce Bixby - a virtual assistant based on technology acquired from some of the original developers' of Apple's Siri.\nThe helper is activated by a dedicated side-button and allows 10 built-in apps - including a photo gallery, messages and weather - to be controlled by voice.\nIt is \"context-aware\", meaning users can ask follow-up questions and assume it is aware of what is currently displayed.\nSamsung said it expected owners to mix together voice commands and physical controls - for example asking to see all the photos taken today, then tapping the ones they want, before verbally requesting they be messaged to a friend.\nThe software can also be used to recognise objects seen via the phone's camera. This can be used to identify a landmark, for example, or tell the owner how much a product would cost to buy online.\nBixby works with Google Play Music, and Samsung intends to open it up to other third-party apps in the future but has not said when.\nAt launch, it is only designed to recognise US and Korean voices.\n\"If what Samsung demoed works well in practice, Bixby will be interesting because it offers features absent from Siri and Google Assistant,\" commented Francisco Jeronimo from IDC.\n\"The race is on to have the best digital assistant, since that will drive hardware sales.\n\"But in the past, some of Samsung's features have looked great in presentations, but when you use them on a daily basis they have not been as good.\"\nWhile Bixby offers new ways to control a phone, it lacks Google Assistant's pre-emptive smarts - it does not interject in chats to suggest places to visit, for example.\nHowever, the search giant's rival artificial intelligence can still be summoned via the home button.\nOther improvements over last year's models include:\nSamsung also has a range of accessories including a revamped virtual reality headset that is now accompanied by its own motion-sensing controller, and a second-generation 360-degree camera capable of more detailed images than before.\nIt also offers a new dock that connects the phones to a monitor, keyboard and wireless mouse, allowing them to act as a kind of Android-powered PC.\n\"Although Microsoft has done this in the past, the performance of the S8 makes it a very compelling experience,\" commented Mr Wood.\n\"But while I'm impressed with the dock from a technology perspective, the practicality of it for consumers is questionable.\"\nI'm not sure I share Samsung's bold declaration that the S8 is \"a work of art\" - but the slimmer handset definitely sits more easily in one hand than its predecessor.\nAnd once you see the surface, which is nearly all-screen, you wonder why you ever needed a physical home button or any other furniture around it.\nThe tech giant has high hopes for its digital assistant Bixby. What I tried was a limited demo model, which only seemed to understand a few predetermined cues such as searching photos and telling you the weather.\nThe idea of using the camera as Bixby's \"eyes\" is neat - but is it enough to draw people away from the more familiar Google Assistant, which will also be preinstalled, as it is on other Android devices?\nI'd like to be able to tell you more about the battery life of what I imagine is a power-hungry little device - but Samsung was coy about that. Batteries are still a sensitive subject.\nSamsung Electronics's stock has shrugged off months of bad news, thanks in part to the popularity of last year's Galaxy S7, strong sales of its OLED screens and other components to rival manufacturers, and the fact that investors hope the firm has learned from its mistakes.\nEven so, the company will hope its latest launch will demonstrate it has turned a corner.\n21 Feb 2016: Galaxy S7 phones unveiled - handsets bring back expandable storage and water resistance\n24 May 2016: Sued by Huawei - Chinese rival claims patent infringement - Samsung later countersues\n8 July 2016: S7 Active fails test - Consumer Reports finds phone fails to survive submerged as advertised\n20 July 2016: S7 Active fix found - Samsung acknowledges and resolves production line fault\n2 Aug 2016: Galaxy Note 7 revealed - Pen-controlled phone gains iris scanner and attracts positive reviews\n24 Aug 2016: First Note 7 \"explosion\" report - News from South Korea of a burnt-out phone\n2 Sept 2016: First Note 7 recall - 2.5 million handsets called back because of battery fault\n1 Oct 2016:  Note 7 returns to sale - Devices return to sale a few days later than planned\n5 Oct 2016: Viv assistant acquired - Tech forms basis for the Bixby helper\n11 Oct 2016: Second Note 7 recall - Action taken after incidents including a fire on a plane\n4 Nov 2016: Washing machine callback - 2.8m machines recalled in US after reports of excessive vibrations\n8 Nov 2016: HQ raided - Seoul office raided as part of corruption probe\n4 Jan 2017: Brighter TVs - QLED-branded TVs, laptops and smart skin sensor unveiled at CES tech expo\n17 Feb 2017: Chief arrested - Vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics, Lee Jae-yong, faces bribery allegations\n27 Feb 2017: Two new tablets - New devices, but Galaxy S8 was not ready for launch at Barcelona's MWC tech expo\n29 March 2017: Galaxy S8 launch - New flagship phones unveiled in New York","summary":"Samsung's latest flagship phones have ditched the physical home button found in their predecessors and introduced a new virtual assistant."}

However, they were killed in Israeli air strikes.\nIn June, militants fired an anti-tank missile at a vehicle convoy carrying construction workers helping to build the new border fence. One Israeli construction worker and two of the attackers were killed.\nAnalysts say that the security situation in Sinai has deteriorated following the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last year, and that local Bedouin criminal gangs, radical Palestinian groups and possibly militant Islamists sympathetic to al-Qaeda have gained a foothold.\nBy Kevin ConnollyBBC News, Jerusalem\nIsrael's border with Egypt in the baking, hostile wilderness of the Sinai desert was among the most dangerous flashpoints in the Middle East until the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. They had been to war four times there in the previous 30 years.\nUnder Anwar Sadat and then Hosni Mubarak, Egypt kept an iron grip on the region offering Israel such strategic certainty that the border between the two countries was not properly fenced.\nSince the fall of Mubarak concern is deepening in Israel that Egypt is less able, or less willing to maintain the same degree of control. There have been a series of incursions over the last year - in the most serious, militants killed 16 Egyptian soldiers before blasting their way through the border fence.\nIsrael fears more - and is building a fence which will run the entire length of the frontier. This latest attack came at one of the last points where work is still to be completed.\nLt Col Leibovich said the militants who crossed the border from the Sinai peninsula on Friday were heavily armed with rifles and equipped with bullet-proof vests and explosive belts.\nThe attack happened about half-way down Israel's 240km (150-mile) southern border, at a point where work is under way to complete the new barrier.\n\"[The militants] opened fire towards IDF troops that were guarding the workers in that area. Another force that was nearby... rushed to the area and targeted those three terrorists,\" Lt Col Leibovich told reporters.\n\"A very big terror attack was thwarted by the quick response of these soldiers,\" she added.\nThe dead Israeli soldier, named as 20-year-old Cpl Netanel Yahalomi, was reportedly shot in the head during the gun battle.\nEgyptian security sources said one of the militants died when his explosive belt was detonated, while the other two were shot dead by the Israeli soldiers. The nationalities of the assailants were not immediately clear.\nDefence officials said work on the border fence in the Mount Arif area was due to conclude in early November. Construction had been delayed because it was difficult in a remote, mountainous region, they added.\nIsrael's options in responding to Friday's attack are constrained, reports BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus.\nIn the past it has chosen to attack Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, prompting rocket fire on Israel in return. But an Israeli strike into Egyptian territory is almost certainly ruled out; such a step could send already delicate Israel-Egypt ties into a downward spiral, our correspondent says.\nNow both Israel and the US will be urging the Egyptian authorities to devote even more attention to security in Sinai, he adds.","summary":"An Israeli soldier and three militants have been killed in a clash inside Israel near its southern border with Egypt, the Israeli military has said."}

It takes images that are about 10 times better than a high-definition TV and those images are acquired at a temporal cadence of one every 10 seconds.

We've been seeing the transit through [a feed] of one of their telescopes,\" he explained.\nScientists observed the transit\n to test ideas that will help them probe Earth-like planets elsewhere in the galaxy, and to learn more about Venus itself and its complex atmosphere.\nVenus transits occur four times in approximately 243 years; more precisely, they appear in pairs of events separated by about eight years and these pairs are separated by about 105 or 121 years.\nThe reason for the long intervals lies in the fact that the orbits of Venus and Earth do not lie in the same plane and a transit can only occur if both planets and the Sun are situated exactly on one line.\nThis has happened only seven times previously in the telescopic age: in 1631, 1639, 1761, 1769, 1874, 1882 and 2004.\nThe next pair will not now occur until 2117 and 2125.\nThe phenomenon has particular historical significance. The 17th- and 18th-Century transits were used by the astronomers of the day to work out fundamental facts about the Solar System.\nEmploying a method of triangulation (parallax), they were able to  \n          calculate the distance between the Earth and the Sun - the so-called astronomical unit (AU)\n - which we know today to be about 149.6 million km (or 93 million miles).\nThis allowed scientists to get their first real handle on the scale of things beyond Earth.\nIn pictures: Transit of Venus\nVenus transit: Your pictures\nModern instrumentation now gives us very precise numbers on planetary positions and masses, as well as the distance between the Earth and the Sun. But to the early astronomers, just getting good approximate values represented a huge challenge.\nThis is not to say the 2012 Venus transit was regarded as just a pretty show with no interest for scientists.\nPlanetary transits have key significance today because they represent one of the best methods for finding worlds orbiting distant stars.\nNasa's Kepler telescope\n, for example, is identifying thousands of candidates by looking for the tell-tale dips in light that accompany a planet moving in front of its host sun.\nThese planets are too far away to be visited by spacecraft in the foreseeable future, but scientists can learn something about them from the way the background star's light is affected as it passes through the planetary atmosphere.\nAnd observing a transiting Venus, which has a known atmospheric composition, provides a kind of benchmark to support these far-flung investigations.\nResearchers also took a close look at Venus itself during the transit, used the occasion to probe the middle layers of the planet's atmosphere - its mesosphere.\nThey were  \n          looking for a very thin arc of light, called the aureole\n, which can only be seen when Venus appears to just touch the edge of the Sun's disc at ingress and egress.\nThe brightness and thickness of the aureole depends on the density and temperature of the atmospheric layers above Venus's cloud tops.\nObservations of the aureole were being combined with data from  \n          Europe's Venus Express spacecraft\n in orbit around the planet to provide information on high-altitude winds.\nThe Venusian atmosphere experiences super-rotation.

The boy managed to escaped and raise the alarm.\nThe victim, who is now 30, told New Zealand's Fairfax media after news of Smith's capture, that he could now stop sleeping with a knife under his pillow.\n\"It's great news, it's excellent,\" he said from his new home in Australia. \"[I feel] relief, a bit of peace of mind that I can carry on with my life without having that fear over my shoulder.\"\nSmith's escape has thrown Corrections and various other government agencies into controversy. It has led to calls for an overhaul of short-term prison release and the monitoring of high-risk offenders.\nIn an email Smith sent to Radio New Zealand he said he had planned the escape by running a criminal check on his birth name and discovering that it had not been red-flagged.\n\"My only anxiety was that somebody that knew me might happen to be at the airport at the same time to identify me,'' he wrote, according to Radio NZ.\nHe also said he had been able to fund the escape with money from various businesses he had run from prison.\nSmith said he chose Brazil because he thought it would be more difficult to extradite him if he was caught, as the two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty.\nHe was arrested after a member of the public in Rio De Janeiro recognised him from images being circulated in hostels and tipped off police. Smith appeared in court after his arrest and has been remanded in custody for 60 days.\nNew Zealand Police Detective Superintendent Mike Pannett said in a press conference on Thursday that it was a relief to have Smith back in custody.\nHe would not, however, say how long he expected Smith to remain in Brazil.\n\"New Zealand will bring him back as soon as possible but we are reliant on the Brazilian justice system to process and deal with the situation,\" Mr Pannett said.\nCriminal Bar Association President Tony Bouchier said police needed to be more thorough when checking the names of criminals.\n\"There's got to be a far more robust process gone through when police are entering people's names into their systems and starting somebody off with a criminal record,\" he told Radio NZ.\nCorrections Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga urged a review of the incident \"so we can make some decisions as to how we can improve how we have temporary releases done out in the community\", according to Radio New Zealand.","summary":"A New Zealand man serving a life sentence for child molestation and murder who escaped to Brazil is now in custody, New Zealand police say."}

An ethics committee - even a serious, independent ethics committee backed by a strong code of ethics - is not a silver bullet.\n\"What is required is leadership that sends a message that the rules apply to everyone; leadership that wants to understand and learn from any mistakes or mis-steps the ethics committee may have identified; leadership that makes it clear to everyone - this is what we've set up the ethics committee to do, this is why they do it, and this is what they've done.\n\"It's that kind of leadership that breathes the life into a code of ethics.

But it was in the 1950s that architecture, interior and product design flourished fusing European and Arab influences. The economic emphasis shifted from agriculture to industry, tourism and trade, creating a new skyline, and growing consumerism encouraged brand advertising.\nA 1960s poster (pictured) for Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, which began flying the newly wealthy to international destinations. The French-designed poster suggests it's made of mosaic while appearing modern, and designer Jacques Auriac - also responsible for the creating iconic French cigarette packets - conjured up posters to destinations beyond the immediate region.\nOpening its doors in late 1967, the boutique L'Artisan du Liban et L'Orient was the response of May El Khoury, the wife of an eminent architect, to the trauma of defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The defeat eroded confidence and left a profound impression on the Arab psyche. Modernising overlooked local crafts and selling them in a chic setting might be interpreted as an act of cultural activism. It softened the humiliation of military defeat for the middle classes, who were attracted to the new Arab aesthetic and to the idea of patriotism through ethical consumerism.\nThe desire to create a contemporary Islamic architecture marked architect Assem Salam's early career in reaction to the 1967 war. Along with Pierre Khoury he felt the construction of specifically Lebanese-Arab religious buildings would revive spirits crushed by the defeat and designed the Khashoggi Mosque (pictured above). After the civil war he founded an association for the preservation of historic buildings seeking to slow down the rush to reconstruct Beirut at the cost of cultural heritage.\nThe nightclub known as B 018 was designed by Bernard Khoury in 1998 in the Quarantaine, the Beirut neighbourhood that saw some of the worst atrocities during the conflict. It has its roots in the 1980s in the thick of the civil war when gatherings were held at a semi-secret location code named B 018.\nThe circular lid covering the subterranean club looks like a helicopter landing pad from above. The lid can also be raised revealing activity below. Khoury claims that in the absence of public spaces above ground his club was designed not for entertainment but to bring people together for therapy.\nThe Egg, a scarred reminder of the civil war, stands near Martyrs Square. It was originally planned to be a cinema at the heart of the largest leisure and shopping complex in the Middle East, part of a modernist, avant-garde architectural movement, but it was unfinished when the civil war broke out in 1975. Fierce fighting around the building left the edifice pock-marked but still standing. This iconic building occasionally hosts cultural events.\nThe Basilica of the Cathedral of Harissa, designed by Pierre Khoury, is pictured at the top of the page. It stands on a hill overlooking a bay, next to an important Lebanese Christian pilgrimage site. The remarkable religious building was conceived with the idea of creating a stronger Christian identity after the 1967 war.","summary":"The main exhibition at this year's Dubai Design Week, Iconic City: Brilliant Beirut, presents a cleverly conceived display of the Lebanese capital's design evolution from 1950 until the present."}
{"id":"35536278","document":"Possibly the worst headline I've ever written. But before I'm accused of completely failing to perform basic contractual duties, allow me to explain why those seven words are rather important.\nSince 2013, the BBC and almost every other leading news organisation in the UK has been locked in a bizarre battle to tell you the truth about Erol Incedal.\n\"Who he?\" I hear you ask. He's a student from London who was accused of preparing some kind of major terrorism plan. And then after two trials he was found not guilty of that allegation. But I can't tell you why.\nThe prosecution of Erol Incedal has been, without a shadow of a doubt, the strangest criminal trial that those of us who report on the law have ever seen.\nApologies. I meant to write \"not really seen much of\" because almost all of what happened was behind closed doors.\nAnd now the Court of Appeal has ruled that the unprecedented gagging order in the case will remain in place forever.\nIncedal was charged with another man, Mounir Rarmoul Bouhadjar, in October 2013. Rarmoul Bouhadjar admitted possessing bomb-making plans. Incedal denied the allegation, saying he had a reasonable excuse for holding them. In 2014, a jury convicted him of that, but they failed to agree whether he was guilty of a more serious charge of preparing an act of terrorism. At a retrial the following year, a fresh jury cleared him.\nI don't know why that jury cleared him. If I did, I couldn't tell you. Some of my colleagues do however know. But they can't tell me. Or you. They'd be in Contempt of Court and could end up in prison.\nErol Incedal's trials involved an unprecedented level of secrecy in courts that are normally open to the public. There were brief periods of public evidence and then slightly longer periods when a group of accredited journalists were allowed in to listen to some of the mysterious evidence. The third and highest level of the case operated in complete secrecy, with the media totally banned.\nAt the end of each secret session that journalists could attend, police took their notebooks and put them in a safe. Where are those notebooks now? You know that scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark in which anonymous officials lock away Indiana Jones's greatest discovery? You get the idea.\nAnd that's been the whole point of this legal battle - to try to find some way to peel the legal gaffer tape from my colleagues' mouths.\nAt the earliest stage of proceedings in 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) sought anonymity for the defendants.\nBoth the home and foreign secretaries had raised concerns with the CPS. lt later told the trial judge, Mr Justice Nicol, that should the \"factors of concern be ventilated in a public trial\", the prosecution would be \"presented with representations\" to drop the charges on grounds of national security.\nMr Justice Nicol ruled the case would be prosecuted \"in camera\". There would be a jury, as ever, but they would never be able to disclose what they heard. The Court of Appeal later modified that to allow journalists to attend some of the hearings - but with no guarantee that anything would ever become reportable.\nSo given those journalists still can't speak, and Erol Incedal can't say why he was acquitted of preparing an act of terrorism, is this a massive outrage to justice in a democracy?\nWell, the Court of Appeal says not.\nThe general principle is that justice must be seen to be done  - but the law also says there can be myriad good reasons to withhold information from the public - not least for the protection of vulnerable witnesses and victims.\nIn the case of Erol Incedal, Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, said in Tuesday's Court of Appeal ruling the nature of the evidence was such that the trial judge had to lock the court's doors.\nHe and two other senior judges ruled that the trial judge had rightly considered that the national security material in the case had to be protected at all costs.\nThe Court of Appeal judgement recognises that secret hearings compromise the media's role in holding power to account: if justice cannot be seen to be done, how does one know if it is justice?\nLord Thomas offers the suggestion that the Intelligence and Security Committee could fill some of that vacuum - although it is, also, a semi-secret body.\nSo what happens now?\nWhile the media gag is legal, the subtext of the Court of Appeal judgement makes clear that it doesn't want courts to lightly enter into the unique arrangements seen in the Incedal case.\nSecondly, the judge fired a warning shot of sorts over the bows of MI5 and MI6. If the agencies were ordered in the future to disclose information for use in criminal trials, and the prosecutors want to go ahead, they cannot simply say no and remain in the shadows.\nOn the face of it, that is a pretty obvious statement that government and its agencies are not above the law - but it is also a clear sign that the next time a case like this comes up, the very high legal test for withholding information from the public remains in play.\nDoes that mean it will never happen again? Not at all. My instincts and experience make me suspect this won't be the last trial of its kind.","summary":"BREAKING: Reporter can't tell you what's happened."}

{"id":"35214514","document":"The tourists closed on 317-5 and, with a lot of batting to come against an inexperienced South African attack, they could still get a total that takes the home side out of the game.\nHowever, if they do, they will have done it the hard way, because the first-day performance with the bat was below their best, with too many players getting in, then getting out.\nAll the talk surrounding England after their convincing win in the first Test concerned the prospect of them finding some consistency, particularly with the bat. Could they nail another good performance to put this series out of South Africa's reach?\nOn this first day in Cape Town, they had the opportunity to do just that after winning the toss and batting first in ideal conditions on a good pitch.\nBut too many of the top order - Alastair Cook, Alex Hales, Nick Compton and Joe Root - did the hard part and then got out.\nEngland want to play freely and busily, they want to be ticking along and that is a fair enough approach.\nBut allied to that is the need to build a careful platform, especially when so many things are in your favour. In these conditions, four wickets down at the close would have been about right, so it can be argued that England lost one too many.\nThat they ended the day with the upper hand was thanks to Stokes who, after a relatively lean spell, once again showed what a fine cricketer he is with an unbeaten 74.\nThe Durham man is a proper all-rounder, always ready to contribute with bat and ball. If one part of his game isn't firing, then he will probably deliver with the other. On top of that, he is a brilliant fielder.\nStokes is a fierce competitor and he further demonstrated that in the way he shredded the second new ball late in the day.\nSouth Africa had built up to that point, putting all their eggs in one basket in the hope that more wickets would come. For Stokes to then smash the ball around must have been pretty deflating.\nYes, he took a chance, but he also created his own luck. He forced South Africa to remove their catchers and go on the defensive.\nIt is performances like this that show Stokes to be a rarity in the world game. It's hard to think of many Test sides that have a genuine all-rounder in their ranks - Australia's Mitchell Marsh and Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews are the only others that come to mind.\nThat dearth of all-rounders shows just how lucky England are to have Stokes at their disposal.\nWhile Stokes has his career up and running, Hales is a man who is looking to do just that.\nAfter he made his debut in the first Test in Durban, I spoke of his need to learn from his mistakes, namely a waft outside off stump and a needless big shot.\nHe did to some extent, making a maiden Test half-century, but there was some more uncertainty in the off-stump area.\nSouth Africa captain Hashim Amla got it quite wrong, opting for a deep square leg instead of a third catcher in the slips, especially when Hales was edging his way through the 40s.\nIf I was an opposing captain, I'd use a packed off-side field to Hales and ask my bowlers to bowl a foot wide, because he will go for the ball eventually.\nThat being said, he's got promise because he does hit the ball so well. He has played some wonderful innings in limited-overs cricket and he deserves credit for his effort here, where he got through the first session, made 60, then was pretty blameless in edging a good delivery from Morne Morkel.\nYes, Hales has the potential to get out in frustrating ways, but he could also be very destructive for England if he finds his feet at Test level. He should be judged after this series.\nThe mistakes against Hales were not the only time that Amla was guilty, with the South Africa skipper again just letting things happen, allowing the game to drift.\nThat being said, he does have an inexperienced attack to work with, but pace bowler Kagiso Rabada impressed in only his fourth match, taking 3-74, including two wickets in two balls.\nThe 20-year-old has a nice action, bowls with decent pace and could be even quicker if he uses his left arm more.\nIt was the pace bowlers who shared the five wickets for South Africa today, but the most telling delivery may have been bowled by off-spinner Dane Piedt.\nSome sharp turn fooled Jonny Bairstow, who was beaten between bat and pad and fortunate not to be bowled.\nThat shows this is a dryish pitch that could turn more as the game wears on. The amount of runs the side batting last would feel comfortable chasing should be adjusted down accordingly.\nJonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt","summary":"England were in danger of wasting a good platform on the first day of the second Test against South Africa until Ben Stokes got going late on."}

The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category.\nWorkless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work.\nPeople may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability.\nThe data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year.\nThis means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households.

{"id":"17514394","document":"This comes after a public outcry following revelations in November that a neo-Nazi cell had apparently been able to go on a nationwide spree of racially motivated murders over several years, under the noses of the German intelligence services.\nThe group of three are being held responsible for the deaths of eight Turkish and one Greek immigrant between 2000 and 2006, as well as a German policewoman in 2007.\nYet the existence of the group, dubbed the Zwickau cell after the name of the town where they spent most of their time in hiding, only came to light in November when two of its members died in an apparent joint suicide or murder-suicide and the third handed herself in to the authorities.\nThe NPD has been linked to the group, though the allegations have yet to be accepted in a court of law.\nThe trio had made a DVD in which they boasted of the killings and said they had acted to serve the German nation and its people, describing themselves as the National Socialist Underground - echoing the national socialism (Nazism) of Hitler's Germany.\nThe story of the killers has dominated headlines in Germany for months now and given rise to one of the biggest scandals in post-war Germany.\nIt turns out intelligence agencies had had the group under surveillance for years, and even found a bomb-making factory in their garage back in 1998.\nSo why were the trio not stopped earlier? Why were they allowed to disappear and then stay underground? And why was it that security services blamed the murders on the Turkish mafia at the time? A right-wing motive was never investigated.\nThe failures have prompted some to ask whether there is more than incompetence to blame, whether Germany's police and security services contain elements sympathetic to the far right - an accusation the institutions vehemently deny.\nA parliamentary inquiry is currently under way into their activities, and Newsnight has seen a secret internal report revealing serious blunders by law enforcement agencies.\nWhen we spoke to Peter Altmaier, a senior official in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat party, he admitted that mistakes had been made:\n\"You have to know Germany is a federal state, and competencies are shared and divided between federal and state levels... and because we have drawn the lessons from the Nazi dictatorship, we have very limited powers of police and security institutions.\n\"There have been hints and indications of right-wing extremism that were not taken seriously enough, and therefore we have put this very high on the political agenda.\"\nAnother question that now worries many Germans is just how big a threat the far right poses.\nHuman rights groups say more than 180 people have been killed in right-wing attacks in Germany over the last 20 years.\nNeo-Nazis have murdered more people in post-war Germany than any other single group, including Islamists and the far left. But this is not yet reflected in official data.\nCould it be that Germany's sensitivity to its history has made it want to play down modern-day right wing extremism?\n\"Martin\", a former neo-Nazi leader who asked to be quoted anonymously for fear of revenge attacks, was an active member of the far right for 11 years. He has now left the movement and encourages others to do so through an organisation called Exit.\nMartin told us the revelations about the Zwickau cell should have come as no surprise to the authorities:\n\"The militant scene has always said we need people who are willing and able and trained in case it comes to civil war, and neo-Nazi propaganda always talks about civil war. The scene is armed. It's military.\n\"Weapons training is carried out in secret. In the Arab world, for example, with freedom movements there. The right-wing scene sees itself as a freedom movement.\"\nThere is a growing collection of secretive far-right groups in Germany which call themselves the \"Free Forces\".\nIntelligence services say this is the fastest-spreading section of Germany's far-right movement.\nThey say the cliche of the neo-Nazi being a boot-wearing, young, unemployed male skinhead is out of date. Nowadays you cannot always tell who is a neo-Nazi and who is not.\nThe Free Forces are attracting a new crowd, including students and middle-class professionals. Germans speak of a new generation of Kravattennazis, literally \"Tie Nazis\", as opposed to the traditional Stiefelnazis, or \"Boot Nazis\".\nThey use modern forms of protest and are harnessing social media.\nTake The Immortals, for example - anti-globalisation, anti-capitalist and anti-democratic, they warn of the impending extinction of the German people and call for a Germany for the Germans.\nHard for the authorities to catch, they use text messaging to organise spontaneous night-time demonstrations across the country, especially in university towns.\nThe protesters wear black cloaks and white masks, reminiscent of the hacker-anarchists Anonymous, to hide their identity. After 15 minutes on the street, they are gone.\n\"The leadership is always trying to attract members of the so-called upper classes and students who, one day, can act as lawyers or doctors for the far right,\" Martin explained.\n\"It's all done very quietly, out of the public eye. You would never imagine that some of those people would support the movement and they may deny their affiliation in public, but they are very much part of the scene.\"\n\"You can't describe the far right as a fringe group any more. All parts of German society are found in it.\"\nBut what exactly do they want?\nFar-right activists are camera-shy. They say they are hounded by police and hemmed in by post-war German laws which make it illegal to question the Holocaust and demonstrate public appreciation of Nazi Germany, leading to a number of far-right groups being shut down and their members prosecuted.\nWe visited Berlin's best-known neo-Nazi pub, The Executioner, to see if we could tempt the punters there to talk.\nMost people in the dimly lit, windowless establishment eyed us with suspicion and distaste, but after a couple of \"Himla'' cocktails, Uwe Dreisch, the former head of a now-banned neo-Nazi group, sat down with us and said:\n\"Who are we? We are nationalists. We care deeply about our fatherland. We don't like the state that exists here right now in Germany. We want to rebuild our country for our citizens, the German people.\n\"We want to protect our culture, our country, our religion. In Britain, you're also proud of your country, but here I, as a German, am a second-class citizen. This is because we live with eternal war guilt here in Germany. Others get preferential treatment, not us Germans.\n\"Those outside here who say this pub is full of evil Nazis, how would they know? They're afraid to talk to us. They just try to ban us.\"\nWhat many lawmakers in Germany say they do not like is that the far right rejects the German constitution and the Federal German Republic.\nSupporters of the far right want a new order in Germany, but while they live under the current system, some are establishing what they call \"national liberated zones\", dotted across the country.\nThe most famous example is Jamel, a village in northern Germany which has been largely taken over by the far right.\nIn the middle of the village is a brightly painted Nazi-style mural in which a traditionally dressed German mother cradles her baby, surrounded by her other children.\nAlso painted there is a proclamation that Jamel is free, social and national.\nWe spoke to Udo Pastoers, number two in the NPD, the legal political wing of the far right, and the leader of the party's elected representatives in the regional parliament of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the area in which Jamel sits.\nMr Pastoers was keen to discuss the NPD's current campaign calling for more indigenous Germans to have children.\nHe showed me a campaign poster emblazoned with the phrase \"German children need our country. Stop the German people dying out\" in which two beautiful blonde parents frolic at a sandy water's edge with their blonde and beaming children.\nMr Pastoers said the birth-rate in Germany was far too low and that women should \"reproduce\" more, so that Germany could still deserve the name Germany.\n\"Imagine a country called Germany that is filled only with Africans, Arabs, Asians. Biology is our priority,\" he said.\nThe NPD does not do very well in the polls. Still, it has elected representatives in two of out of Germany's 16 regional parliaments.\nMr Pastoers told us the party was virtually gagged by the German authorities. If they really could speak openly, he said, a huge chunk of the German electorate would support them.\nThe NPD insists the stigma of being associated with the far right in modern Germany means that people who would like to vote for it do not dare to.\nIn an attempt to boost its numbers, the party is currently concentrating on social issues, taking advantage of widespread unease caused by the global economic crisis.\nThey and the wider far-right movement run youth centres and football clubs, and offer welfare advice and family outings for those short of cash.\nFormer neo-Nazi Martin, who spoke of close links between the NPD and extremist groups like the one he used to lead, said the party's social card was insincere.\n\"They can't win over all parts of society with anti-Semitic and Nazi rhetoric. The welfare debate touches most people these days, but it is fake.\n\"One well-known neo-Nazi activist said: 'We'll make sure to be where people are suffering most, where they are shouting for help... Eventually we'll have them where we want them.'''\nGermany's far right is a minority movement but one the country's authorities cannot afford to ignore.","summary":"The security services in Germany are scrambling to track down and arrest far-right fugitives and Germany's federal and state interior ministers have announced they are taking concrete steps towards banning the country's far right National Democratic Party, the NPD."}

We would like to save lives, not see them caught up in a continuing war\".\nMr Davutoglu said their main objective was to \"protect the innocent civilians of Syria\".\nIn Rome on Thursday, Mr Kerry promised direct aid to Syrian rebels in the form of food and medical supplies, but not the weapons they say they need to win.\nTurkey has taken in more than 200,000 Syrian refugees and has been hit by deadly shelling across its 900km (560 mile) border with Syria.\nTurkey wants the Syrian rebels to win the war as soon as possible and will be keen to convey its sense of frustration to Mr Kerry, the BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul says.\nThe US and other Nato allies have deployed Patriot missile interceptors to repel any possible attack by missiles or aircraft from Syria.\nMr Erdogan has been outspoken in his support for Syrian rebels and has advocated the creation of a buffer zone inside northern Syria to protect people fleeing the fighting.\nTurkey began massing troops along the frontier in June last year after Syria shot down a Turkish reconnaissance jet off its coast.\nIn October the Turkish army fired on military targets in Syria in retaliation for cross-border mortar fire.\nThe rebel Free Syrian Army is thought to receive weapons and other supplies from Turkey.\nThe US has refrained from arming the rebels, in part because of concerns the weapons could eventually fall into the hands of Islamist militants who might attack its interests.\nOn Thursday in Rome, Mr Kerry promised an additional $60m (\u00c2\u00a340m) in aid to the opposition Syrian National Coalition to help it deliver basic governance and other services in rebel-controlled areas.\nHe also promised direct support in the form of food and medical supplies to rebel forces, in what correspondents say was a shift in US policy on Syria.\nRussia - a close ally of President Assad - has said the promises of aid to the opposition made by the US and other countries in the \"Friends of Syria\" group will encourage further violence rather than a negotiated solution.\n\"The decisions taken in Rome... directly encourage extremists towards precisely a violent seizure of power, despite the suffering of ordinary Syrians,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich said.","summary":"New US Secretary of State John Kerry has been holding talks with his Turkish counterpart on the conflict in Syria."}

{"id":"39325536","document":"But being an editor isn't just an editorial job.\nThe editorial side of it is the most fulfilling and intellectually stimulating part, but it is only a part.\nThere are also huge commercial responsibilities - how do we make money and save money? - and leadership and management duties.\nLeadership is about creating a moral vision for where you want to take a team; management is the daily activity of getting them there.\nIt has always seemed to me that in rich newspapers, the editor gets to focus on editing, while other people think about the commercial and managerial side of it.\nFor instance, the Daily Mail has several busy managing editors, whereas the Evening Standard has only one.\nGeorge Osborne to become Standard editor\nOsborne Evening Standard job prompts call for inquiry\nGeorge Osborne: From history buff to austerity editor\nRead more from Amol\nAt organisations that are strapped for cash - and the Standard is facing big commercial challenges - editors have to spend relatively more of their time thinking about commercial and managerial obligations.\nAnd all of that is hugely time consuming. It leaves less time than you would like for the really exciting bit: editing.\nEditing is an exercise in selection and judgement: what to put in and - just as important - what to leave out.\nWhich pictures, campaigns, and above all stories to run? What's the best headline on that front page splash? Shall we give this or that person a kicking in the sports pages? And should our cartoonist really depict Nigel Farage as an amphibian yet again?\nWhen making these decisions, based on your judgement, which is in turn informed by your values and experience, an editor has three sacred loyalties - in my view, in no particular order.\nFirst, to the truth; second, to the reader; and third, to the integrity and reputation of the newspaper.\nSome would argue that there are other loyalties.\nAn editor of The Catholic Herald might think they had a duty to God, for instance; an editor of Country Life might feel they had a duty to England's enchanted land; and all editors are likely to feel a duty to those paying the bills.\nBut those earlier loyalties are supreme.\nThey are very different to the loyalties required by political parties.\nI have never been a member of a political party, but I suspect those who have would say their loyalties aren't primarily to truth, readers, or newspaper reputations.\nA political party is an institution that organises its members to acquire and exercise legislative power.\nIts members have loyalty above all to that task. If they are committed, they wake up every day thirsting for power.\nOnce they have acquired it, fidelity to their tribe makes them determined not to relinquish it.\nQuite aside from the sheer practical workload, it is not easy to see how the loyalties required by editorship and the loyalties required by membership of a political party can be reconciled.\nThe latter long to inhabit the corridors of power. The former want to throw grenades at it.\nJournalism, at its best, is about the ferocious scrutiny of power.\nThat requires a certain distance from it. Of course, there are different types of journalism.\nI can see how it might be feasible for a theatre critic to be group secretary of his local Socialist Workers Party.\nI can also see how a brilliant football correspondent could be a member of the neo-Nazis.\nBut an editor, who has to conduct daily combat with politicians?\nIn being a member of the Conservative Party and, soon, editor of the London Evening Standard, George Osborne faces both practical and philosophical problems.\nThe practical one is when to sleep. The philosophical one is how to reconcile his clearly divided loyalties.\nWhich of his constituents matter most - those in Tatton, or his near-million readers at the Standard?\nHow does he cover, say, a Budget: as a loyal Conservative MP, or as a fearless editor?\nIt is hard enough to see how you reconcile being a member of a political party with being a journalist, let alone being an editor.\nHowever, being not only a member of a political party, but a sitting MP and a recent chancellor, as well as someone who retains political ambitions, is much tougher still.\nAnd that's before we even consider BlackRock. How can you cover the world of asset management while being paid \u00c2\u00a3650,000 by it?\nThe idea that Mr Osborne could recuse himself from stories about that industry, or indeed the City pages altogether, strikes me as sub-optimal, to put it mildly: it would be bizarre to have a former chancellor as editor, only for him to have no involvement in business coverage.\nThese conflicts of interest are untenable, and so - as I said on Friday - I can't see it lasting.\nGiven his sources of income, he's much likelier to give up being an MP before he gives up having lunch at BlackRock.\nWhether it happens when Tatton disappears as a constituency, or before, I suspect he will be editor of the London Evening Standard after he is an MP in Cheshire.\nAs I mentioned in my previous posts, his task at the paper - setting out a clear strategy, improving the product, raising its profile, and turning the business around by finding new revenue streams - is one for which he has relevant experience and connections.\nThat said, it strikes me as a full-time job. Perhaps, therefore, Osborne hasn't fully grasped the function of an editor.\nI hope this post helps.","summary":"Editing a newspaper is an extremely rewarding and tough job, probably harder these days than a few decades ago, because of scarcity of resources and the demands of the internet."}

Of the 21 pallets, 10 were unaccounted for, seven landed in no-man's land and four were damaged.\nBut it has since carried out 44 air drops over the city, delivering mainly rice, chickpeas and beans to meet the immediate needs of around 100,000 residents.\nThe WFP has identified some 592,700 people in 19 besieged areas that may need to receive aid by air.\nBut the operating conditions are challenging, it says. Many besieged locations are in built-up, urban areas with no suitable space for a drop zone. High-altitude drops are not possible in those areas because of the risk of harming people on the ground.\nThe UN food agency says airdrops are always a last resort as access by land is more efficient.\nMeanwhile, aircraft from the US-led coalition dropped ammunition to rebels in the town of Marea, in Aleppo province, the UK-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\nIt was not clear if weapons were also delivered.\nRebels are fighting militants from so-called Islamic State (IS), who cut off supply routes between Marea and Azaz, both under rebel control, near the Turkish border.\nThe area between the city of Aleppo and the Turkish border is split between IS, rebel and government-controlled zones.\nThe US is also supporting an offensive by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), made up by Kurdish and Arab fighters, against IS-held Manbij.\nThe Syrian Observatory also said Islamist insurgents, including from the al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front, and government forces have attacked each other near Khan Touman, in southwest Aleppo.","summary":"The United Nations will ask Syria to allow the air drop of humanitarian aid to areas under siege, diplomats say."}

Some consumer groups say the measures do not go far enough.\nThe Information Commissioner's Office received 120,310 complaints about \"unsolicited marketing calls\" from April-November 2013.\nIt is illegal for companies to call domestic numbers registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS).\nThe Telephone Preference Service runs a register that allows people to opt out of any unsolicited sales or marketing calls.\nIndividuals can register free of charge by visiting the website. Or they can call 0845 070 0707. It takes 28 days for registration to become effective.\nMobile phone numbers can also be registered, although this will not prevent unsolicited text messages.\nIt is a legal requirement that all organisations - including charities, voluntary organisations and political parties - do not make such calls to numbers registered on the TPS unless they have the individual's consent to do so.\nTelephone Preference Service\nThe rules do not apply when people consent to their details being used for marketing purposes.\nBut BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said members of the public continued to get unwanted calls - often pre-recorded - despite being registered with the TPS.\nThat was because not all companies were members of the Direct Marketing Association - the UK telemarketing industry body - some were overseas and some were \"good old-fashioned fraudsters\" out to steal money, he said.\nThe problem of unwanted calls may never be fully eradicated, he added.\nRepeat offenders include firms inquiring about mis-sold payment protection insurance.\nFirms which flout the TPS rules can currently be fined up to \u00c2\u00a3500,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office.\nThose which break media regulator Ofcom rules on silent and abandoned calls face fines of up to \u00c2\u00a32m.\nCritics say the system is not working because rules on enforcement are skewed in favour of rogue firms.\nUnder Culture Secretary Maria Miller's plans, the current \"substantial damage\" threshold could be lowered.\nThey would also make it simpler for regulators such as Ofcom, the Insolvency Service and the Information Commissioner's Office to swap data about who the offenders might be.\nAnd the Ministry of Justice will launch a consultation on Monday on whether firms that break the rules should face fines of up to 20% of their annual turnover.\n\"Nuisance calls must stop,\" Ms Miller said.\n\"At best they are an irritation and an unwanted intrusion; at worst they cause real distress and fear, particularly to the elderly or housebound.\n\"People need to feel safe and secure in their homes.\n\"The rules are clear - people have the right to choose not to receive unsolicited marketing calls.

{"id":"35916857","document":"But it leaves the issue at the heart of the dispute unresolved: could the FBI have forced Apple to help it unlock the device?\nIt is unlikely that this will be the last time a law enforcement agency tries to compel a tech company to help bypass security measures.\nIt had been reported that there were about a dozen other cases in which the US Justice Department was pursuing court orders to force Apple to help its investigators.\nThe highest profile of these was in Brooklyn, New York, where the FBI wanted access to an iPhone belonging to a defendant who had already pleaded guilty to drug dealing.\nIn that case, a federal judge had rejected the DoJ's effort to invoke the All Writs Act - a three-centuries-old statute that allows court orders to be issued in circumstances where other laws don't apply.\nThe DoJ had launched an appeal, but it is not yet clear if it will continue or drop it. Its decision may be based on whether the technique used to extract data from Farook's handset can be used in other cases.\nThe New York case involved an iPhone 5S running the iOS 7 operating system, while the San Bernardino, California case was about an iPhone 5C running the more modern iOS 9. What works against one device might not work against the other.\nBut assuming the US government will at some point try again to use the All Writs Act to force Apple or some other tech company to circumvent its data protection measures, it may take a Supreme Court ruling to determine whether this is truly within the authorities' power.\nAt this point, there is nothing to compel the FBI to reveal how it was done, although Apple is likely to be pressing hard to find out.\nThe tech firm's lawyers have already said they would want details of the technique to be made public if evidence from the cracked iPhone is later used at trial.\nBut it could remain secret. There is scope within US law for the authorities to withhold the source of information if it was supplied to them on a confidential basis, and to protect sensitive intelligence-gathering methodologies.\nNot necessarily.\nThe court order originally obtained by the FBI had instructed Apple to come up with a special version of its operating system that would have prevented Farook's iPhone from deleting its data or imposing long lockout periods if too many incorrect passcode guesses were made.\nHowever, the latest court filings do not say that someone else has now done this, but merely that some data stored on the device has been obtained.\nResearchers at the cybersecurity firm IOActive had proposed that one way of getting data off an iPhone would be to \"de-cap\" its memory chips.\nThe process they described involved using acid and lasers to expose and copy ID information about the device so that efforts to crack its passcode could be simulated on another computer without risk of triggering the original iPhone's self-destruct tool.\nIf indeed this is what happened, it is not easy and there's a high risk of causing so much damage to the phone that the desired data becomes irretrievable.\nBy contrast, Cellebrite - a data forensics firm that has reportedly helped the FBI with the case - has previously discussed \"bypassing\" passcode locks rather than trying to deduce the number.\nBut it is possible that doing this would yield access to only a limited amount of a handset's data.\nOne other point is that Apple recently updated its iOS software.\nEach upgrade adds security fixes. So, if the FBI has indeed been alerted to a flaw in Farook's phone's security settings, that bug may no longer exist in devices that have installed iOS 9.3.\nShort of destroying the device, perhaps no.\nBut you can use encryption-enabled apps to digitally scramble data.\nThe chat tool Wickr Messenger, for instance, lets you set it so that you have to enter a password each time you log back into the app.\nLikewise, PQChat requires typing in a five-digit passcode of its own to get access.\nSo, even if a cracked iPhone did give up the contents of its text messages, emails and WhatsApp chats, the contents of the apps mentioned above should remain safe.\nAll this presumes, however, that the authorities do not manage to install spyware on your device. If that happens, all bets are off.\nAs part of her efforts to pass the Investigatory Powers Bill, the home secretary Theresa May has said that tech firms wouldn't have hand over encryption keys or build backdoors into their platforms.\nBut the law still makes mention of \"equipment interference warrants\".\nCampaigners at the Electronic Frontier Foundation have warned that these could be used to force Apple and others to insert new code into a device in order to help the authorities extract data, in a similar manner to the FBI's earlier order.\nThe EFF adds that \"matching gag orders\" would prevent the firms from informing their customers or even their own lawyers about the act.\nEquipment interference warrants already exist under the UK's current law.\nAnd for now, the focus of Apple and other tech firms is getting the Investigatory Powers Bill amended to say that in the future the warrants could only be amended with the permission of a judge.\nBut were there to be a case where the UK police attempted to coerce Apple to override its  protective measures, it might still resist - even if the fact never became public.","summary":"The US government's declaration that it has \"successfully accessed the data stored on [San Bernardino gunman] Farook's iPhone and therefore no longer requires\" assistance from Apple, ends a six week-long legal clash between the tech firm and the FBI."}

{"id":"37799701","document":"For chief executive Somnath Saha, the economics of tea are simple and brutal.\nTyphoo Tea produces 125 million tea bags a week at its factory in Moreton, Wirral, which have just one ingredient - tea leaves, and they are imported.\nBlack tea is a global commodity, traded in dollars. Following the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote, costs have soared for this renowned brand as 95% of its sales are in the UK.\n\"This is an absolute disaster for a company the size of ours,\" says Mr Saha.\n\"The very sharp fall in the pound means the impact is at least a quarter of a million pounds a month for us. This is having a very negative impact on our business and we are really suffering. It's now come to a point where it's not sustainable for us.\"\nThe news comes amid warnings of rising prices in the grocery sector, and with supermarket chain Morrisons increasing the cost of a jar of Marmite by 12.5%.\nThere are plenty of winners from the fall in the value of sterling. But Typhoo Tea is a graphic illustration of what it's like for a business with one raw imported material.\nTyphoo has been trading for more than a century. These days, most of its black tea comes from Kenya. It's then blended and packaged on site. The company also packages own-label tea for most of the major supermarkets.\nIn addition, it produces a range of herbal teas and those ingredients are sourced in euros.\nIt's a high-volume, low-margin business.\nThe cost of the ingredient depends on the quality of the leaf. A typical 80kg bag of black tea could be bought for \u00a390 to \u00a3100 at the beginning of the year. The company says that same bag now costs \u00a3120 to \u00a3150 at the weekly international auctions.\nIn other words, it is paying an awful lot more for the same amount of tea.\n\"We don't have big enough margins between us and retailers to absorb all these costs. We're looking at how to mitigate some of them, from our labour, overheads and marketing costs, which will affect the growth of the business and employment in long run. But some of these currency costs will have to be passed on, as neither us nor the retailers can absorb any more cost increases,\" Mr Saha says.\nLike other suppliers, he is in discussions with the supermarkets about price rises. He denies posturing to try to secure a better deal.\n\"Absolutely not. This is a really serious situation for us. Nobody wants to do this, but ultimately some of the costs will go to the shoppers. There is no other option,\" Mr Saha says.\n\"It's one of the favourite drinks of this country. It's very unfortunate. It's nobody's fault - it's due to the economic conditions.\"\nTyphoo Tea is owned by the Indian conglomerate Apeejay Surrendra Group, which Mr Saha says has supported the UK business for the last few months.\nBut he warned that if the fall in the pound was sustained, his business would be set to lose \u00a33m, all but wiping out its profits. The time has now come to do something about it, he says.\n\"For everybody, it's been so difficult after June. We can't plan anything. Every day, you don't know what is going to happen next week. There is so much volatility.\"\nTyphoo employs some 300 workers in the UK.\nMany suppliers are talking to the supermarkets about price rises. These negotiations are normally confidential but they spilled into the open when Tesco's spat with Unilever became public.\nRetailers and suppliers regularly discuss prices but, according to one industry expert, the current situation is different.\n\"This is no cat and mouse game. What we've been seeing here is unprecedented,\" says David Sables from Sentinel Management Consultants, which advises suppliers on how to negotiate with supermarkets.\n\"The real change that's happened here is that it's happening at a time when the retailers' margins have been squeezed by the battle with Aldi and Lidl. They can't take any more pain. It comes with a price increase to them, they will have to pass it on.\n\"There needs to be a new approach, a getting together of everyone to sensibly sit down and see how they can protect the consumer against what is a real industry issue,\" he says.\nThere are ways to absorb costs. For instance, Tesco and Morrisons are trying to make their businesses more simple and efficient which will save money in the long run. Packaging and product sizes can also be reviewed.\nBut after years of falling prices in the aisles, it seems inevitable that some prices will rise.\n\"I think there is a wave of price increases to come, as early as January. That's when we'll see the biggest impact,\" says Mr Sables.\n\"The generally accepted view is 5% - that's an understatement of what we're seeing on the foreign exchange. The view is that the industry will absorb some of that difference.\"\nFor Typhoo Tea, the time has come to pass on some of its costs.\nIn the longer term, its boss says he will be trying to boost exports and take advantage of any Brexit opportunities, but the focus now is dealing with the fallout.\nMr Saha adds: \"This is a real loss, a real pain for this business and we cannot accept this loss any more.\"","summary":"The cost of a cuppa will have to rise, according to the boss of Typhoo."}

{"id":"40041968","document":"There's no getting away from it - the big-screen adaptation of the 1990s TV series is simply two hours of pure entertainment.\nThe action sequences are huge, the soundtrack is awesome, and the people are ludicrously good looking.\nBut it's also just totally ridiculous, which may not surprise those who have seen the trailer. Or read the somewhat less-than-kind reviews.\nDwayne Johnson - the highest paid (and most annoyingly likeable) movie star in the world - takes the lead in the reboot as Mitch alongside Zac Efron, who plays Brody.\nKelly Rohrbach, Alexandra Daddario and Priyanka Chopra also star, and there are, most importantly, cameo appearances from David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson.\n(I would've thought they'd want to keep those as a surprise, personally, but their names appear in giant letters at the beginning alongside the rest of the cast.)\nBut this incarnation of Baywatch is much more knowing and tongue-in-cheek than it was in Hasselhoff and Anderson's day.\nThe film itself is long - presumably to allow for the slow-motion button to be used to its full potential when any character is running down the shoreline.\nThose who lived through the TV show will remember the appeal of such bouncy scenes, which were a key part of helping the series become a worldwide phenomenon.\nAnd a phenomenon it was. Baywatch became the most-watched television show in the world at the time and represented a huge cultural shift.\nAnderson was the embodiment of a look which rose to prominence in the 90s - skinny, blonde, and enhanced by plastic surgery.\nBut strangely, the show arguably also had a moral compass, which may help explain why it got its early evening slot on TV.\nThe lifeguards were portrayed as something of a family, working as a cohesive team and looking out for each other while saving lives.\nA lot of the storylines felt wholesome and saw characters doing the \"right thing\" - an odd juxtaposition with the highly sexualised elements of the series.\nMitch's relationship with his son is a good example - Hasselhoff's character is seen as a model single father to Hobie, doing his best to raise him with good morals and life skills despite the absence of the boy's mother.\nBut in many other ways, Baywatch is rather problematic.\nIt goes without saying that, in real life, very few of us indeed look as good as the Baywatch lifeguards as they dash down the beach in their orange swimsuits.\nThe male characters played by Johnson and Efron are muscular to a borderline unhealthy degree, while the women are tanned, big-chested and and impossibly skinny.\nNearly 30 years on from the show's TV premiere, you'd like to think we've come further than still accepting these as beauty ideals.\nStars such as Lena Dunham and Sarah Hyland have started to hit back at \"body shaming\" in recent years - a term which barely existed when the TV show aired.\nSocial media has helped drive a movement of being proud of who you are and how you look, and there's now a bigger fightback against the concept of the \"perfect\" body than there ever was in the 90s.\nBut you get the impression that everyone involved in the project totally gets and even embraces how unrealistic some elements of Baywatch are.\nAnd at least the film knows how to make fun of itself.\nMitch mocks Brody's boyband-level good looks throughout the film, referring to him invariably as \"One Direction\", \"Bieber\", and \"High School Musical\" instead of by his actual name.\nAnd at one point, Brody tells Mitch that the concept of lifeguards investigating crimes \"sounds like an entertaining but far-fetched TV show\".\nBut does such a show still have a place in 2017? Realistically, it probably shouldn't.\nWe arguably should be over beautiful people running along a shoreline making immature jokes and getting involved in such obviously contrived storylines.\nSince the TV series, life has happened. The internet has happened. Our tastes should have become more refined as the amount of choice available to consumers has exploded.\nBut Baywatch remains stupidly entertaining, one of those junk food films which is perfectly enjoyable provided you aren't going in expecting to see the next best picture winner.\nYou might feel guilty watching it, but the 2017 incarnation of Baywatch is, quite simply, unfiltered escapism - and there are far worse things in the world than that.\nBaywatch is released in UK cinemas on 29 May.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

{"id":"36457309","document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nWes Hoolahan gave the Republic a deserved lead shortly after half-time with a crisply struck half-volley worthy of opening the scoring in any match.\nMartin O'Neill's team had struck the woodwork and gone close several times prior to scoring.\nBut, after taking the lead they found themselves under increasing pressure and conceded when Clark, chosen ahead of Richard Keogh in the centre of defence, headed a low cross from Zlatan Ibrahimovic into his own net.\nThe equaliser came from one of the few moments of quality from the Sweden captain, who collected a neat backheel from substitute John Guidetti and raced to the byeline before drilling in a low cross.\nJeff Hendrick drew a late save from Andreas Isaksson but there was to be no winner at the end of a feisty, scrappy match the Republic shaded but could not close out.\nCommitment, passion and determination were much in evidence at the Stade de France, with those workmanlike qualities comfortably eclipsing any quality and finesse on show.\nBut, in the end, neither side had quite enough to prevail and are left to ponder a result that is hardly disastrous but not exactly what either wanted.\nBoth have remaining Group E fixtures against Italy and Belgium - the two favourites to progress - and have arguably missed out on their best chance to get a crucial victory.\nIn a tournament with 16 qualifiers from the group stage, three points would have taken one of them a huge step towards reaching the next round.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe Republic lost all three of their games at Euro 2012, when Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni set up his team to try to stymie their opponents and snatch the points.\nYet after qualifying from a group that included Poland and Germany, there was no lack of adventure and ambition here in Paris.\nRobbie Brady was a menace down the left, Hendrick struck the crossbar with a caressed right-foot strike and drew a superb save with a crisp shot from the edge of the area, and John O'Shea was inches from converting Clark's flick-on.\nThere was also no disputing the quality of Hoolahan's goal three minutes after the restart.\nSeamus Coleman delivered a superb cross after a teasing, jinking run down the right and Hoolahan, who had found space at a premium in a generally congested midfield, superbly smashed home a half-volley from 14 yards across goal and beyond Isaksson.\nHendrick forced another save from the Sweden goalkeeper with a low strike after his team conceded and the men in green showed enough to suggest that whatever happens to them in this tournament they will leave everything on the field.\nIbrahimovic said before the match that \"the legend can still deliver\", but it did not look like it for most of the match. On many occasions - especially during the first half - the 34-year-old was drawn so deep in search of the ball that he looked more like a midfielder.\nIbrahimovic, strongly linked with Manchester United, scored 11 of his team's 19 goals in qualifying, and going into the fixture with the Republic might have fancied his prospects against a central-defensive pairing of O'Shea and Clark.\nYet he had very little chance to improve on his record of 62 international goals. He struck the wall with a free-kick, snatched a volley and was inches from converting a low drilled cross.\nBut he was at the heart of the move that led to the equaliser.\nThe unfortunate Clark had already gone close once to putting the ball in his own net with a header Darren Randolph did well to save before Emil Forsberg hammered the rebound wide.\nBut Randolph could do nothing to stop Clark's header after Ibrahimovic had finally sprung to life and at least partially justified his top billing.\nRepublic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill: \"I thought we were magnificent in the game with some really great football.\n\"Of course the goal deflates you and there is disappointment in the dressing room, but I don't think the players should be downhearted with their performance.\n\"I think they should be absolutely thrilled with the way we played.\"\nGoalscorer Wes Hoolahan: \"The boys were unlucky but we'll take the point.

Earlier that day he was interviewed on a liberal radio station, in which he had called on listeners to join a rally.\nAt the time, Nemtsov was working on a report examining Russia's alleged role in the conflict in Ukraine.\nPresident Putin called the murder \"vile and cynical\" and vowed to hold those responsible to account.\nRussia has seen several killings of high-profile politicians and journalists in recent years.\nBut the country has a long history of prosecuting alleged hit-men and failing to follow the chain of command to discover who ordered the murder, correspondents say.\nIt took the 12 jury members more than 12 hours to reach their verdict. They spent it in a closed room in one corner of the military courthouse with a guard posted outside the window.\nBut when they finally filed back into court, it was to pronounce every one of the accused guilty. In each case they ruled by a clear majority.\nStanding opposite them inside a glass cage, surrounded by armed police and a Rottweiler, the men from Chechnya listened in silence, looking relaxed and even smiling as they had for much of this trial.\nThere was speculation that one of the accused, Khamzat Bakhayev, might be acquitted for lack of evidence. When the jury found him guilty too, his wife burst into tears.\nBut outside, lawyers representing Boris Nemtsov's family said they believe the trail of evidence leads to senior figures within Chechnya, loyal to Vladimir Putin.

{"id":"27511927","document":"From star players to influential club legends, the 62-year-old Dutchman has made a few enemies during his 42 years in football, the past 23 of those coaching some of Europe's leading clubs and the Netherlands national team whom he led to third place at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\nDuring his first news conference at Old Trafford, Van Gaal insisted he was more \"democrat\" than autocrat, extolling his \"strong personality\" - a trait, he reminded his audience, he shares with former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.\nBut why does Van Gaal come to English football with such a fearsome reputation? BBC Sport gets the inside story on his biggest bust-ups.\nThe time he was told he was too slow\nLouis van Gaal never lacked confidence and his strong personality was there, even as a player. He made his name as a midfielder with the Royal FC Antwerp, under Guy Thys, the legendary Belgian coach.\n\"I was annoyed that he did not always play me,\" Van Gaal later recalled. \"I was one of four foreigners and he could only play three in those days. Thys reckoned I lacked pace.''\nThys said: \"He'd come up to me and ask me why I did not play him. 'Boss, I am the best player, aren't I?' And then I would tell him he was not. He could not believe that.\n\"I do admit he had by far the strongest personality of all the players I have come across. But, sorry to say, he was slow\u2026 \"\nOne of Van Gaal's best performances came in a 4-1 victory over Aston Villa in the home leg of the Uefa Cup tie in 1975. \"That day against Villa he was absolutely brilliant,\" Thys remembered. \"For the return match he asked how he should play. I said: 'Like you normally do, slowly.'\n\"I remember that conversation well. He could not see the funny side of my answer.  But we needed to take the pace out of the game. And it worked. We beat them in Birmingham 1-0. And Louis was fantastic again. He never played such a brilliant game again.''\nVan Gaal was infuriated by Thys's negative approach to the second leg. He felt Antwerp should have kept attacking. \"I had respect for him as a person, but I did not rate him as a coach,\" Van Gaal said. \"Probably because he put me on the bench too often. I reckoned I should play. He did not.''\nVan Gaal was so unhappy in Belgium football he wanted to leave. \"I wrote 80 letters to get a job elsewhere. I only got one or two replies, but I did get my move,\" he said.\n\"Thys threatened to stop me from leaving by demanding a big transfer fee. So I said, do what you like, but I will take my old job of PE teacher again, if you do that. No sweat at all. So they let me go.''\nThe time Rivaldo wanted to change position\nIn 1999 Van Gaal was in charge of Barcelona and Rivaldo was at the peak of his powers.  The brilliant Brazilian inspired Van Gaal's side to their second consecutive La Liga title from out on the left wing, collecting the Fifa World Player of the Year award in the process.\nBoudewijn Zenden, who was with Barca at the time, recently recalled what happened next: \"Rivaldo thought he was better off playing behind the strikers, so when he won the Golden Ball he just said to Van Gaal: 'I don't want to play on the left anymore. I want to play behind the strikers.' Van Gaal said: 'Right. that's your decision' and he sat on the bench - because only the manager decided where he would play.\"\nAlthough he quickly got back into the team, Rivaldo only scored 12 league goals that season - down from 24 the previous campaign - and Van Gaal left after Barca failed to retain the La Liga title.\nHis departure was celebrated by the media, who had disapproved of his stance with Rivaldo and also disliked Van Gaal for his aggressive attitude towards them and failure to fully learn either Spanish or Catalan. Upon his departure, Van Gaal famously announced to the media: \"Friends of the press, I am leaving. Congratulations.\"\nThe (many) times he has clashed with Johan Cruyff\nThe Dutch nation can be divided in two halves in terms of their loyalties - pro-Cruyff and pro-Van Gaal.  The two men have never got on. They are opposites: Cruyff, the world-class player who naturally became a manager. Van Gaal, the ordinary player with an academic background who became a world-class manager.\nThe annoying thing for Cruyff was that Van Gaal followed him to the two biggest loves of his life, Ajax and Barcelona, and was successful at both.\nIn his autobiography, Van Gaal alleges the feud began in 1989 when he hurriedly left a dinner at Cruyff's house without thanking his host for the meal after receiving a phone call informing him of the death of his sister - a claim rejected by Cruyff.\nA decade later, Van Gaal felt that Cruyff undermined his managerial stint at the Nou Camp by repeated criticisms in the Catalan press, with Van Gaal bitterly noting: \"I will never forgive what he did.\"\nTheir enmity simmered for years, not helped by Cruyff's observations that Van Gaal has \"one or two screws loose in his head\", but it reached new depths in 2011, when Cruyff took the extraordinary step of going to court to prevent Ajax from appointing Van Gaal as their new chief executive.\nCruyff was one of five members of Ajax's advisory panel and the only one who didn't want Van Gaal - so the other four went behind his back to appoint him anyway. Cruyff was furious, took the legal route and was eventually successful as the court ruled in his favour, overturning the appointment. Van Gaal said: \"Of course it hurt. People forget that Ajax is also part of my life.''\nThe time he showed Mark van Bommel the door\nWhen Van Gaal arrived at Bayern Munich in the summer of 2009, Mark van Bommel - his captain and compatriot - was one of the most important players as the club won the domestic double in Van Gaal's first season.\nBut in the winter break of the following season, Bayern bought Hoffenheim's 23-year-old Brazilian Luiz Gustavo for \u00a313m. Gustavo was one of the rising Bundesliga midfielders... and 10 years van Bommel's junior.\nVan Gaal told van Bommel in person he was no longer his captain, adding that his future competitors would also be Andreas Ottl, Anatoliy Timoschtschuk and Danijel Pranjic. Van Bommel was furious and Bayern watchers mystified. Nobody played the role of central defensive midfielder better than Van Bommel and the comparisons seemed insulting.\nBut Van Gaal wanted to make his team younger and to strengthen his position in the club by getting rid of one of their most important players. It was also said he feared that Van Bommel, who was good friends with Arjen Robben and Bastian Schweinsteiger, was becoming too powerful.\nThe German press saw it as an egocentric way of making it clear who was in charge, but Van Gaal was unrepentant, saying: \"It is normal that the relationship crashes when a manager does not pick a certain player any more. A manager has the right to do it. Mark was very angry with me. But I did not decide whether he should leave or not.\"\nBy the end of that month Van Bommel had joined AC Milan.\nWhen Luca Toni got an ear-bashing at the dinner table\nThe Italian international Luca Toni was a big hero at Bayern when Van Gaal arrived, having won the double playing alongside Franck Ribery under Ottmar Hitzfeld in his first season and scored 38 goals in 56 Bundesliga games across two campaigns. But from their first days together, Toni and Van Gaal had a terrible relationship.\nIn one training camp the Dutch coach was unhappy with Toni's manners when the team assembled for meetings and meals. One day Toni, a tall man, was slouching on his chair during dinner, as if he were watching TV on a sofa. Van Gaal went behind Toni's chair and pulled his ears to make him sit up straight.\nFor a proud Italian this was a humiliation. \"The way Van Gaal treated the key players was unworthy on a human basis,\" Toni later reflected.\nIn September 2009, Van Gaal forced Toni to play two matches for FC Bayern II, their amateur team in Germany's third division, while he was recovering from an Achilles tendon injury. The match was watched by about 2,000 fans as the 2006 World Cup winner stumbled on the bumpy ground at the old stadium.\nVan Gaal, though something of a showman himself, could not stand Toni's playboy image, with the Italian frequently portrayed as Bayern's \"beau\". The coach also felt Toni lacked discipline and fined the Italian in November 2009 when he left the stadium at half-time, having been substituted during a match against Schalke.\nThe time he dropped his pants\nVan Gaal revelled in his reputation as fearlessly belligerent and at Bayern went to extreme lengths to prove it. \"Van Gaal wanted to make clear to us that he can drop any player from the team,\" Luca Toni revealed later.\n\"It was all the same to him because, as he said, he had the balls. He demonstrated this literally by dropping his pants. I have never experienced anything like it, it was totally crazy. Luckily I didn't see a lot, because I wasn't in the front row.\"\nThe time he insulted his Bayern bosses\nIn October 2010 Van Gaal invited Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeness, two senior members of the Bayern hierarchy, to the launch of his new book, Biographie & Vision, in a Munich hotel.\nIt should have been a convivial moment, especially as Hoeness had written the book's foreword. However, Bayern were experiencing their worst ever start to the season at the time and were 13 points from the top of the league, which made it all the stranger when the ever-confident Van Gaal gave them a copy, saying: \"You can learn from it. It is important that you read it.\"\nHis bosses looked on angrily but not did say anything. Realising what had happened, he said afterwards: \"Maybe I will get fined for it, but I don't think so.\" He did not get fined but many date the rift between him and the club to this moment and he was sacked six months later.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe time the 'ultimate professional' won him round\nNot all of Van Gaal's clashes have a bitter end. When he took over as Dutch coach for the second time after the team's disastrous performances at Euro 2012, the atmosphere among the Dutch players was so bad that the first thing Van Gaal did after his appointment was to bring them together in a luxurious hotel room in the village of Noordwijk on the Dutch coast, close to where he lives in a big penthouse.\nHe asked for their views on the 2012 Euro finals. Most gave theirs but Van Persie remained silent because, Van Gaal later discovered, he did not want to criticise anyone by speaking out.\n\"I saw that as a negative attitude,\" Van Gaal said, \"so I declared that from that day on Klaas-Jan Huntelaar would be my number one striker and Robin had to accept a role on the bench.''\nThe first game of Van Gaal's second stint as coach was against Belgium, ironically the night Van Persie's transfer to Manchester United was confirmed. He stayed on the bench for the whole 90 minutes, but did not complain.\nWhen asked if he regretted Van Gaal's appointment, the forward said: \"Not at all. From what I have seen in the first few days, he has all the qualities of a fabulous manager. I say that despite the fact he has put me on the bench.''\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nVan Gaal, who had expected Van Persie to react negatively,  was amazed by the \"professional attitude and spirit\" of his striker. \"I had to admit later that I really did not know the person behind the player, Van Persie in 2012. I knew certain players shared my football philosophy. About Robin I knew nothing.\n\"I had to get to know him. But when I did, I soon realised he was an amazing professional. He was the ultimate pro. And also important for me was that he was very social towards the other players in the squad.\n\"He showed leadership - and this is why 10 months later I made him captain of the Dutch team. He deserved that. He completely shares my vision on football.''\nAdditional reporting from Andy West, Patrick Strasser and Marcel van der Kraan.","summary":"New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has never been afraid to have an argument or make it clear who is in charge."}

She said the dress would act as a way of commemorating him at her wedding to fiance Andrew Stewart.\nThe dress is currently being altered, and when she heard that Mrs Newall's had gone missing at the dry cleaners she says she \"did panic\".\nShe added: \"I just think it's wonderful that they've had it returned.\"\nFor Rachel Cohen, from Edinburgh, the discovery of her grandmother's dress in the loft spurred on the idea to go retro.\n\"I knew there were dresses up there amongst a lot of random stuff,\" she said.\n\"I even found one dress which much have been from a previous generation, but it just couldn't have been worn.\"\nHowever, the one Granny Marie Waterston wore in the 1930s was in superb condition and perfect for Rachel's special day.\n\"I had never been the type of person to dream of a big white dress, so when I found it, packed away all neat and tidy in a box, I had the idea to wear it,\" she said.\n\"I had to cut the sleeves off as she had such tiny hands, but otherwise it was the same.\"\nHaving her grandmother's dress meant a lot to Rachel when she married in 2009.\n\"My mother died when I was young and I looked after my grandmother when she was old, so we had a close relationship,\" said Rachel.\n\"It was special to have her dress there, even when she couldn't be.\"\nWhile those three brides opted for the personal touch with their dresses, they join growing numbers of people choosing vintage items more generally.\nLouise Croft, ethical fashion blogger at PaupertoPrincess.com - who will be wearing a 1940s gown for her wedding later this year - said going vintage had many benefits, from following fashion cycles to stopping garments ending up in landfills.\nShe said the growth of online sharing had also led to brides wanting to stand out even more, and going down the classic route often means the dress is one of a kind.\n\"It feels like giving a precious piece of history a moment in the limelight rather than it being in a museum or attic,\" added Louise.\n\"Of course, you always wonder what tales and secrets it holds and if it's from a family member then you are lucky enough to also have all these answers.\"\nKat Williams, editor of Rock 'n Roll Bride, said although dresses have been passed down for many years, a lot more people were putting their own touches to them.\n\"We had one woman in the magazine who wore her grandmother's dress and customised it all to make it more modern,\" she said. \"She shortened it, added a big petticoat and made it more fitted.\n\"It looked great but offered that little bit of family history too.\n\"Even if you buy a dress from a vintage shop, it means you won't see lots of other brides wearing the same thing and a bride wants to feel unique.\"","summary":"Social media was captivated by a 150-year-old wedding dress that had been lost after a dry cleaners went bust."}

Now people will expect him to engage in a major house-cleaning exercise by showing the door to corrupt government officials and old-school public servants.\nThis will pose a huge political risk, as they are well-entrenched in CCM.

And they feel Russia should also give some slack.\nThere are a number of factors in favour of a rapprochement.\nFirst of all, Russia has itself now come face-to-face with IS terrorism - with the destruction of the tourist plane from Sharm el-Sheikh.\nThis has jolted perceptions in Moscow, for which IS is now a designated enemy.\nSecond, Russia has every interest in cultivating Paris as a new friend.\nStraight after the Paris attacks, Mr Putin ordered his military to co-ordinate with the French in the campaign against IS - an unprecedented act given that France is in Nato.\nThe Russian leader was effusive with compassion, and even sent a dog - Dobrynya - to replace Diesel the French special forces Alsatian who was killed in the raid in Saint Denis.\nIt was all very deliberate, because there is nothing the Russians would like more than to lure the French out of the American-Western orbit.\nIn the geopolitics departments of Russian universities - and some French ones too - this is regarded as a historically-determined necessity.\nFrance and Russia, after all, are two great nations lying at either end of the European continent - with a shared interest in preventing its domination either by outsiders (the US) or insiders (Germany).\nThroughout the last three centuries the two countries have been periodic allies - notably in the run-up to World War One.\nBut also President Charles de Gaulle himself - though viscerally anti-Communist - kept his distance from the Americans by flirting with the Soviet Union.\nWhat could be more natural - say Kremlin insiders - than for France to resume its natural role, triangulating between Washington and Moscow?\nBut tempting as this might sound to some in France, there is no geostrategic shift in the offing.\nFor one thing the French do not trust Vladimir Putin.\nFor another, the two countries still have opposing visions on too many key issues.\nFrance will never abandon Ukraine. And in the Middle East, France's allies are the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia - not the Shia axis backed by Russia.\nThere is a concordance of interests bringing Paris and Moscow together. With luck, this will help in the battle against IS.\nBut there is no new alliance.","summary":"French President Francois Hollande's visit to Moscow comes at a time of fast-shifting diplomatic alignments and priorities, triggered by the spread of Islamic State (IS) terror."}

{"id":"36072119","document":"Dubbed Nuit Debout (Up All Night), it is a self-styled \"popular assembly\" in which participants share views about politics and the state of the world.\nAs night descends, the speakers stand patiently in line and, turn by turn, take the microphone for their allotted five minutes.\nBefore them, sitting in twos and threes on paving stones, the young audience responds with the occasional cheer or boo.\nNot that there is a huge amount to react to. The speeches are rambling and platitudinous.\nOne orator says the essence behind society should be \"values\" - but she does not say which.\nAnother urges an end to hierarchy - \"no more pride, no more ego - just ideas\".\nA third wants to speak of human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nOne theme that recurs is the need to tolerate divergences of opinion. This is significant. Two nights previously, one of France's best-known philosophers - a man who a generation ago would have himself been at the mike - was spat on and told to leave.\nBoth speakers and listeners appear to be mainly students - an impression confirmed by a tour of the various \"stands\".\nThe feminists are in a large huddle, and I am asked not to take photographs. Elsewhere, a screen shows a laborious film made by a woman who took a job distributing junk mail and wants to expose the exploitation.\nThere is a group of anti-speciesists, and a \"TV studio\" (TV Debout!) consisting of a camera and white sheet and a lap-top. No-one is using it.\nSomeone has planted a minuscule vegetable patch beneath a tree (Jardin Debout!).\nOne banner calls for a new French constitution. Another proclaims the \"convergence des luttes\" - the ultimate left-wing dream: the coming together of all the struggles.\nIt is like wandering through a university campus during a sit-in. The same mixture of wide-eyed joy and po-faced earnestness. The same thrashing out of texts that no-one will read. The same evanescent self-importance.\nAll of which would be perfectly unexceptionable, were it not for the fact that - this being France - the Nuit Debout movement has been accorded a public status that it does not remotely deserve.\nThe  media - with rare exceptions - have been predictably breathless in their reporting of this \"democratic awakening\".\nThe impression is put about that la jeunesse (the youth) is once again - as in May 1968 - doing a service to society by reclaiming debate from a decrepit political establishment.\nWorse, the politicians themselves go along with this myth. No-one dares say boo to a \"popular manifestation\" that borrows its imagery from the country's revolutionary past. Even some right-wing politicians have said they are \"solidaire\".\nThe crowning irony is that - in the face of la jeunesse en colere (angry youth) - the Socialist government has already made major concessions.\nThe origin of Nuit Debout was the protest movement against Prime Minister Manuel Valls's vaguely pro-business new labour law.\nBut under pressure from President Hollande (who is petrified by the prospect of youth on the streets), Valls has not just removed the more contentious clauses - he has also offered 500 million euros a year in new grants for the young.\nThere is even talk now of extending welfare payments that normally kick in at 25  to 18-year-olds - even though the cost of that would be a ruinous six billion euros a year. This in a country committed - supposedly - to bringing down its deficit of 70 billion euros.\nIn reality, Hollande has made a very political calculation. Though protests against the labour law will no doubt continue, their bite has been removed.\nThe threat is over, and he can keep alive - for now - the fiction that he will be the left's natural candidate in next year's presidential race.\nMeanwhile, the Nuit Debout movement will remain as a dwindling, harmless legacy of the president's last bid to reform. Harmless, because the Place de la Republique protesters are now static, tame and increasingly absorbed in their utopian irrelevance.\nBut the deeper lesson of the episode is more troubling.\nFrance is a country prone to self-deception. Its obsession with the symbols of a revolutionary past blinds it to the realities of an undesired present.\nMovements like Nuit Debout sustain the delusion that left-wing ideas are thriving. They are not.\nThe country is increasingly moving to the populist right - not least out of exasperation at a discredited orthodoxy.","summary":"Since the end of March, hundreds of people have been gathering every evening in the Place de la Republique in Paris."}

As a result, only the left arm moves freely.\nSo President Putin officially has a \"gunslinger's gait\" - but doctors should be aware that a reduced right arm swing can also be an early sign of Parkinson's disease too, the British Medical Journal research says.\nIs there such a thing as a 'hard man' walk?\nMr Putin insisted his country's economy was recovering.\nWhile oil prices had fallen sharply, he said, manufacturing had shown slight growth and there was a healthy trade balance in agriculture.\n\"Our economy depends on oil and gas prices, we expected Brent to be worth $100 per barrel, but then it was $50, but this was an optimistic prediction too, our forecasts have to be amended again,\" Mr Putin said.\n\"GDP is falling, inflation is 12.3%, incomes, investment are falling too but the peak of the economic crisis is over.\"\nMr Putin is known for his marathon performances at his news conferences, where he frequently uses hard-hitting, colourful language.\nThis year's event lasted three hours and seven minutes - three minutes shorter than last year's.\nThe record for a Putin news conference was set in 2008, at four hours 40 minutes.\nPutin's Ukraine 'admission': Analysis by Olexiy Solohubenko, BBC News\n\"We never said there were no people there who were carrying out certain tasks, including in the military sphere,\" President Putin told the annual news conference.\nIt is an important admission. After months of denial, insisting that the only Russians fighting in eastern Ukraine were either \"volunteers\" or \"army servicemen on holidays\", Mr Putin now says Russian military personnel are on the ground and are involved in the fighting.\nHe still maintains \"there are no Russian troops there\" and insists there is a difference. However the distinction may be very blurred for Ukrainian soldiers facing the Russian-backed separatists and Russian military personnel, as has now been admitted.\nWhether the Russian servicemen are attached to the separatist units, or are there as commanders, trainers or advisers and are not on the ground as regular units, is in many ways a technicality. What President  Putin has admitted is that Russia is present in eastern Ukraine and is engaged in military activity.\nIt may be stating the obvious, but the way this admission has been made is not new.\nFor many months, President Putin denied Russian troops being involved in the takeover of the Crimea - he called the heavily armed soldiers seen there in modern uniforms without insignia, dubbed \"green men\", a local self-defence force.\nBut earlier this year, he told Russian TV that he had instructed his special forces (spetsnaz) to get directly involved in the annexation.","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has used crude language in a furious new attack on Turkey over the shooting down of a Russian combat jet last month."}

Although this cannot be verified with absolute certainty, the brutality and style of the siege suggests it was the work of extremists targeting foreigners.\nLibya is in a state of political chaos with a security vacuum and there are few reliable sources with whom to check facts.  On a day when Tripoli witnessed this brazen and deadly attack, reporters were faced with statements from competing political blocs who seemingly tried to capitalise on the incident.\nMr al-Hassi claimed he was the target. The elected government in the east will use it to make the case for broadening their crackdown on Islamist groups - which some blame for further radicalising some of them.\nWhat it has shown is that this lawless land is making it easy for extremist groups to mushroom.\nDifferent sources at the scene said there were between three and five attackers - footage released later on Tuesday showed the body of a man reported to be one of the militants.\nA security source told the BBC that one gunman had been arrested.

{"id":"14294642","document":"But the independent report voiced concern that no clear scientific, medical or social benefits had emerged from nearly one in 10 projects.\nIt also said that in a minority of experiments, the justification for using monkeys was \"not compelling\".\nThe review was led by Professor Sir Patrick Bateson.\nThe current president of the Zoological Society of London was commissioned by the main bodies that fund medical research in Britain.\nThey wanted him to assess whether the studies on non-human primates (NHPs) were necessary, high-quality and yielded significant advances in medical science.\nAnimal welfare groups opposed to experimentation on monkeys called again for the practice to be banned outright.  They described Prof Bateson's review a \"chilling insight into primate research\".\nAlthough the proportion of monkeys used in research compared with other animals is low, less than 0.1%, there is concern that they suffer more than other species during experimentation, and so should only be used if those studies are expected to yield important medical benefits and if there is no other way of carrying out the research.\nThe review suggested that this standard might not have been achieved in all cases.  \"Not everything is rosy in the garden,\" Prof Bateson told reporters.\nHe reviewed experiments on monkeys carried out between  January 1997 and December 2006. Just under 3,000 animals were used in experiments in that period.\nThe bulk of the research focused on neuroscience. Research on great apes is not permitted in the UK and so monkeys provide the next best animal models to study the human brain.\nResearchers often cite the widespread prevalence of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as a justification for research in this area.\nHowever, Prof Bateson said that the \"size of the problem should not be accepted as the sole justification for individual areas of research\".\nHe added: \"Funders and researchers should avoid overstating and generalising the medical benefit (of research on monkeys). Instead, statements should be based on the actual scientific basis for funding decisions.\"\nConsiderable suffering\nProf Bateson and his team looked at 31 neuroscience studies. Half of the experiments involved considerable animal suffering. These were assessed as having a high scientific value.\nBut in most cases, according to Prof Bateson, there was \"little direct evidence of medical benefit\". He did concede, though, that there might not have been sufficient time for the advances gained in scientific understanding to be translated into new drugs or treatments.\nThe report recommends a body to be set up to assess whether commissioned research will lead to improvements in healthcare.\nProf Bateson's review found a few instances of research that caused a high degree of suffering, but was not judged to be the highest-quality science.\nOne example was of UK-funded research on reproduction carried out overseas.\nIt involved performing a hysterectomy in which the mother and its foetus were, in the words of the review, \"compromised\". The study was undertaken to train students and repeated a study that had been carried out a decade earlier.\nAccording to Prof Bateson, \"it is not acceptable knowingly to fund work outside the UK that would not be legally responsible or ethically acceptable in the UK\".\nThe report also said scientists had a \"moral responsibility\" to publish all their results on experiments involving monkeys even if they were not positive or not deemed interesting.\nResearch results are often not published when the experiments do not yield positive results, but Prof Bateson's point is that because some of these details are not put in the public domain, it could lead to other researchers repeating the experiments and so causing unnecessary suffering.\nStrengthened procedures\nResponding to the report, the Medical Research Council (MRC) said: \"Despite the use of peer review to assess whether projects we fund are worth doing, it is inevitable that some of it does not work out.\"\nThe MRC added that it would continue to work to ensure all grants using non-human primates made clear the expected scientific, medical or social benefit, and that if these benefits were not realised, the reasons why should be explored to ensure lessons were learnt for the future.\nIn a joint statement, the main funders of monkey research in the UK - the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust and the Biological and Biotechnology Research Council - said improvements to procedures had already been made.\n\"We have strengthened our procedures for assessing all grant applications requesting use of [monkeys], cats, dogs and equines,\" their statement read.\n\"These applications are now reviewed by the independent National Centre for the Refinement, Reduction and Replacement of Animals in Research (NC3Rs).\n\"Any concerns are explored with the applicants, and funding is not awarded unless these are properly addressed. We will continue to work with the NC3Rs to ensure that all research we fund using NHPs is assessed appropriately and the research undertaken is of the highest standard in terms of science and animal welfare.\"\nThe British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection said primate research was a blind alley that had no merit.\nChief Executive Michelle Thew said: \"This report is a chilling insight into primate research in the UK. Regulations to protect primates are failing.\n\"It is shocking that 25 years after legislation was introduced to give primates special protection, many experiments are being carried out that have a devastating impact on them with little or no human benefit. The only measure that would completely protect primates, and ensure more productive medical research, is an outright ban.\"\nIn general, the number of animal experiments carried out in the UK rose by 3% last year, according to government figures.\nJust over 3.7 million scientific experiments on animals were started in Great Britain in 2010, an increase of 105,000 on the previous year.","summary":"A review of the use of monkeys in UK medical research says the practice should continue and finds the current work to be generally of good quality."}

At least now it brings everybody into line to play cricket together under the same regulations.\nHowever, on pitches which are bound to suit the spinners - an area where India excel - and wear appreciably over the five days of a Test, I imagine the decision will help the Indians immensely.\nPlaying spinners with DRS in place is an altogether different and more challenging prospect than without it and it will make India more difficult to beat for England.\nThat's not the main point though: it's good India have joined in with what everyone else has been doing for a few years.\nIndia v England tour schedule\nThat's an interesting question and many of the answers lie in the fact there has been a changing of the guard at the top of Indian cricket recently.\nThat has brought about a much more open mind to these things. Their head coach Anil Kumble, who was opposed to the DRS system to begin with, has now changed his view.\nWith a number of new players coming into the side, he's been able to show that it might possibly be the right thing for his side.\nBeforehand, batsmen like Sachin Tendulkar, for instance, were opposed to it.\nThey felt the opposition would always keep a review up their sleeve especially for them because they were such key players.\nUltimately, however, it's as simple as a change of attitude within the administration of the Indian cricket team which has led to this decision.\nOnce we get onto the pitch, I think India, under their innovative new captain Virat Kohli, will use it well.\nSpin bowlers tend to have more success on the turning pitches of the subcontinent, and India have the world's number one bowler - off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin - in their ranks.\nEngland's batsmen must be careful how they play the spinning ball. For instance, you can't just plant your pad and play around the ball because of the risk of getting out lbw.\nWe've seen in the current Test match in Chittagong how central the DRS system is to games on the subcontinent.\nMoeen Ali overturned three lbw decisions to remain at the crease and score a determined 68.\nThose decisions were reversed because the ball was shown to be missing the stumps, but if it comes down to fine margins and the umpire has already given a batsman out then it will stay that way.\nThat's the challenge for England, and one which they are dealing with in Bangladesh at the moment.\nJonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Marc Higginson\nMedia playback is not supported on this device","summary":"There might have been a few concerned England batsmen when news filtered through that the decision review system (DRS) will be in place for their tour of India next month."}

{"id":"38082943","document":"There was no secret that the picture today's Autumn Statement would paint would not be pretty. But more than \u00a3100bn of extra borrowing, roughly equivalent to the entire NHS budget - nearly \u00a360bn of that the costs of Brexit - make a brutal backdrop for Theresa May's government as it only just gets going.\nRemember all the figures ought to be taken with a giant pinch of salt. Forecasts like these have so often been wrong. And no one is forecasting a recession.\nBut what the chancellor said today and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated have big implications.\nFirst off, with the goal of balancing the books now an aspiration to be met as \"early as possible\", next Parliament, the Tories will be going into the next election, a decade after they took charge, without having kept the central promise they made 10 years before of clearing the deficit.\nYes, you read that right - a full decade. As political promises go, that is a less than glorious record.\nVoters will see the national debt hitting 90% of GDP, not shy of \u00a32 trillion, 10 years after being told that tough spending cuts were worth it, because within five years we would be on our way back to the mythic sunlit uplands.\nThere is a separate debate about whether that was ever achievable, and how much Brexit can be blamed for the fact Mr Hammond has pushed those targets back again.  But at the very least, it means the Conservatives will still be borrowing, and borrowing significantly, busting their own timetable by at least five years.\nAnd with wages predicted to slow, and inflation expected to rise, the public will feel the pinch too. Simply, if today's forecasts are right, the government's finances are set to be shaky for a lot longer, and more voters will feel skint.\nDespite Theresa May's repeated desire to help families who are finding it hard to make ends meet, there were few measures that will make a big difference.\nPrivately, Treasury sources acknowledge they haven't done that much, despite Number 10's hopes. The truth is that they didn't have much cash to play with.\nAnd Mr Hammond's ambitions to rebuild the fundamentals of the economy were clearly his priority, rather than major concessions to help some groups of voters feel a bit more flush.\nIndeed, the charts that estimate who is bearing the brunt of the government's policies suggest that when everything is taken into consideration, not just today's measures, the three poorest groups are all slightly worse off. The only group that loses more is the top 10%.\nBeyond all the charts and tables and documents, though, Mr Hammond dropped one giant hint which is perhaps politically one of the most important things of the day.\nHe was talking about the \"triple lock\", the guaranteed increases in the state pension, seen by many in Westminster privately to be completely unaffordable in the longer term, but few will yet say it in public.\nHe said: \"And we will meet our pledge to our country's pensioners through the triple lock. But as we look ahead to the next Parliament, we will need to ensure we tackle the challenges of rising longevity and fiscal sustainability.\n\"And so the government will review public spending priorities and other commitments for the next Parliament in light of the evolving fiscal position at the next Spending Review.\"\nThat sounds pretty bland, but the implications are anything but. It holds out the possibility that the Tories could look at ditching those guarantees and \"other commitments\", perhaps the ring fence of the NHS Budget, when they look at what the country can afford after 2020.\nIt was only a hint, but in time it may become a very important one. Mr Hammond rarely says anything by mistake.\nBut, without fighting that political battle, there was plenty that was bruising enough from today's announcements, plenty to make the government's life harder, and indeed, potentially those of plenty of voters too.\nPS As ever, the documents published alongside the statement bear close examination. In the coming days more important nuggets may emerge.\nBut a few quick ones that caught our eye -  the administration of Brexit is expected to cost the taxpayer \u00a3412m. The government has set aside \u00a360m a year for grammar schools to expand.","summary":"Ouch!"}

{"id":"35701607","document":"Two communities are claiming compensation and want Shell to clean up their land.\nShell said it is at an \"early stage\" in reviewing the claims and that the case should be heard in Nigeria.\nThe Ogale community of about 40,000 people in Rivers State, on the coast of Nigeria, who are mainly farmers or fishermen, are some of the claimants.\nTheir case is being handled by law firm Leigh Day.\nSpills since 1989 have meant they don't have clean drinking water, farmland or rivers, their claim says.\nIt points to a November 2015 report by Amnesty International which says four spill sites Shell says it planned to clean up are still contaminated.\nThe first court hearing at the Technology and Construction Court, held on Wednesday, found that the claimants can can lodge a case against Shell's Nigerian business, known as Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC).  Shell declined to comment on the ruling.\nAmnesty's findings followed a 2011 report by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which found water contaminated with oil by-products including benzene, thought to be a carcinogen. It suggested a clean up, but said a \"sustainable recovery\" of the area could take up to 30 years.\nShell says it has agreed a clean-up plan.\n\"In mid-2015 SPDC JV, along with the government, UNEP and representatives of the Ogoni community, agreed to an 18-month roadmap to fast-track the environmental clean-up and remediation of Ogoniland which includes a governance framework,\" it said in a statement.\nThe Bille community, who are mainly fishermen and are the other party to sue, claims Shell should be liable for \"failing to protect their pipelines from damage caused by third parties\", according to Leigh Day.\nPipelines in the area have been targets for thieves who steal crude oil and try to refine it locally. This has lead to more spills and damage though explosions.\n\"Both Bille and Ogale are areas heavily impacted by crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining which remain the main sources of pollution across the Niger Delta.\n\"Ogale is in Ogoniland and it is important to note that SPDC has produced no oil or gas in Ogoniland since 1993.  Access to the area has been limited following a rise in violence, threats to staff and attacks on facilities,\" Shell said.\nBut the communities say Shell pipelines lack the technology to detect and shut off leaks, whatever the cause.\nDaniel Leader, partner at Leigh Day said: \"It is scandalous that four years after the UNEP Report Shell is yet to clean up its oil in either Ogale or Bille.   Our client's patience has now run out and we intend to force Shell to act since it is clear they have no intention of doing so on their own.\"\nIn January last year, Shell agreed to an $84m (\u00c2\u00a355m) settlement with residents of the Bodo community in the Niger Delta for two oil spills.\nThe same law firm, Leigh Day, said their 15,600 clients would receive $3,300 each for losses caused by the spills.\nThe remaining $30m would be left for the community, which Leigh Day said was \"devastated by the two massive oil spills in 2008 and 2009\".\nThat dispute began in 2011.\nDuring the trial emails, letters and internal reports submitted to a court in London, and seen by the BBC, showed that senior Shell employees were concerned before the spill that Shell's pipelines in the area had reached the end of their lives and needed replacing to avoid danger to lives, the environment and the economy.\nTwo spills in 2008 affected about 35 sq miles (90 sq km) in southern Nigeria, according to the Bodo community which sued Shell.\nShell said at the time it \"dismisses the suggestion that it has knowingly continued to use a pipeline that is not safe to operate\".","summary":"Oil giant Shell is being sued in London for the second time in five years over spills in the Niger Delta."}

It's been two years of constant fighting for our freedom of speech, our rights, our wellbeing.

{"id":"35520820","document":"An article in Buzzfeed suggesting that the social network was about to introduce what is known as an algorithmic timeline - promoting tweets deemed most relevant rather than publishing them in reverse chronological order - sparked a wave of what can only be described as furious panic.\nUnder the hashtag #RIPTwitter, thousands, perhaps millions, told the world that this was the end of civilisation as we know it, that a beautiful thing was being crushed, that the company, whose share price has been tumbling for months, was signing its own death warrant.\nFinally, the CEO Jack Dorsey was forced to react. \"Hello Twitter!\" he called out. \"Regarding #RIPTwitter: I want you all to know we're always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week.\"\nHe went on \"Twitter is live. Twitter is real-time. Twitter is about who & what you follow. And Twitter is here to stay! By becoming more Twitter-y.\"\nBut was Dorsey right to blink in the face of pressure? And should he be \"always listening\" to his users? That depends on whether you believe the hoariest old cliche of management books: \"The customer is always right.\"\nI certainly sympathise with those who say that Twitter isn't broken, so it does not need the kind of radical fixing implied by an algorithmic timeline. For me, it works just fine, connecting me to like-minded communities of dog-owners, sourdough loaf bakers, and gadget enthusiasts, while providing the best breaking news service on the planet.\nLike many other heavy users of Twitter, I have been sniffy about recent innovations such as \"Moments\" and would rather things carried on just as they are. But perhaps Mr Dorsey and his management team should not be listening to people like me - we're almost certainly going nowhere. He has to cock an ear to the concerns of three other constituencies - investors, advertisers and the people who use Twitter infrequently or not at all.\nBecause the crisis in his company is not about revenues, which are growing nicely, and it's not about what loyal users think - it is about growth. The last set of results showed Twitter user numbers had barely moved over the previous three months, up just four million.\nInvestors who bought into the business when it floated on the hope that it would grow at the same rate as Facebook, shuddered at that news and will be watching nervously when the next set of results is published on Wednesday. Advertisers are asking why they should spend money with a network when it is not delivering the kind of audience available elsewhere. So Twitter's top team is trying all kinds of tricks to make the experience of joining and using the network more intuitive.\nAnd there's another reason why Jack Dorsey might be tempted to ignore those users protesting about a change that has not even happened yet. If he looks at the history of Facebook, he will see that just about every innovation introduced by Mark Zuckerberg has met with dismay from existing users. Here's how Techcrunch reported the arrival of something called Newsfeed in 2006:\n\"There has been an overwhelmingly negative public response to Facebook's launch of two new products yesterday. The products, called News Feed and Mini Feed, allow users to get a quick view of what their friends are up to, including relationship changes, groups joined, pictures uploaded, etc., in a streaming news format.\"\nPetitions were signed, boycotts organised,  but quite soon the News Feed was seen as core to the Facebook experience, and then when it was tweaked there were again protests - from people who thought it was just perfect as it was. By the way, Zuckerberg's reaction to the Newsfeed protests was to say: \"Breathe. We hear you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" and then carry on with his original plan.\nSo the customer is not always right, and if you listen too closely to your existing users, you will end up preserving your site in aspic.

This sounds brilliant, after all it is a win-win situation and what is there not to like about it?\"\nHowever, it has been widely acknowledged that such schemes - if not implemented properly - can have a significant negative impact on people's livelihoods, such as indigenous communities, and exacerbate poverty.\n\"This has been taken on board by, for example, the World Bank,\" observed Prof Jones.\n\"They have made commitments that anything they fund [and] people are displaced as a result, they must be compensated for it.\n\"These commitments are also encapsulated in other doctrines, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.\"\nBut she added: \"The problem is how do you go about doing that? The way that the World Bank guidelines work is that households affected by a scheme must be identified and then compensated for the negative impact of the establishment of a protected area on their livelihoods.\"\nIn order to test whether the commitment to \"social safeguards\" were working on the ground, the team of UK and Madagascan researchers looked in detail at an area within Madagascar where a new protected area was being established.\nThe work was being funded by the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility.\n\"We have shown that, yes, they have gone out there and identified households that they think are affected negatively by conservation and have delivered compensation.\"\nHowever, she added, the compensation was not reaching those most affected by the project.\n\"We have mapped every single household that should have been covered by the compensation and have shown that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the process had some very serious biases in it,\" she said.\n\"Essentially, the people that were identified were easier to reach physically - such as closer to the road or closer to the administrative centre.\n\"They also tended to be more socially connected; members of local forestry management committees, and they were - on average - richer or, at least, less poor.\"\nProf Jones said it was not what would be expected from a scheme that was delivering the help where it was needed most.\n\"People that are closer to the administrative centre are further away from the forest so they are less dependent on forest resources for their livelihoods,\" she suggested.\n\"What is interesting here is that the World Bank has very explicit guidelines that it has to be pro-poor and target vulnerable groups. We have shown that it is not working.\"\nShe said the study required researchers to spend a long time in the area in order to learn where all the households were located. In some cases, team members had to walk for eight or nine hours in order to reach some of the most remote communities.\n\"A criticism is that you can miss households like that if you come in for a short period of time but this is one of the problems;  you cannot expect consultants paid through a World Bank project to be putting in that level of effort to find individual households,\" she added.\n\"We do not want to be criticising the individual implementers of that particular project but we want to highlight a 'reality gap' between these lovely policies that sound great on paper and the reality on the ground which is that it is incredibly difficult to implement these policies.\"\nProf Jones said the study's aim was not to pass judgement on the projects nor the way the compensation scheme was implemented.\nThere is value pointing out that there is this reality gap,\" she added.\n\"In countries like Madagascar, there is such poor mapping so when you are planning something like this and you do not have a map that shows villages that have primary schools etc then you are not going to be allocating sufficient resources.\n\"I would say that whenever there is any sort of effort to implement a conservation scheme then there needs to be an effort to map the human population. Relying on very old and out-of-date maps is not sufficient.\"\nThe team suggested that providing compensation to all households in an affected area would prove to be more financially efficient, as the cost of providing the resources needed to map and assess households \"may not be feasible\".","summary":"Remote communities are not receiving the compensation they are entitled to from schemes designed to conserve tropical forests, a study suggests."}

On the freer market end of things, George Osborne coined the evocative ambition for there to be a \"march of the makers\".\nThe rhetoric hasn't always matched the policy outcomes. Industrial policy at Westminster now consists of a push towards a more technically literate workforce, and incentives aimed at 11 chosen sectors, ranging across aerospace and automotive to nuclear and wind power, life sciences and professional and business services.\nThere are also 'catapult centres' for propelling ideas towards the market in robotics, synthetic biology and better batteries.\nIf you want to see what British manufacturing looks like these days (under German management and with a lot of robots), I'd highly recommend 'Building Cars Live' on the BBC iPlayer for two more weeks. We could do worse than make it required viewing for all secondary school pupils, particularly those with a bad experience of work placements.\nMeanwhile, the recent success of Jeremy Corbyn in winning the Labour leadership points to a desire, in some quarters, for a more interventionist government, willing to take control of strategic industries to serve a social purpose in addition to the shareholder one.\nSo is this time to think again about an industrial policy? Even the Confederation of British Industry, which was closely aligned with the free market orientation of recent governments, wants to see a lot more intervention.\nWithout it, Mr Osborne may find the makers are marching backwards. Wood Mackenzie, the economic consultancy based in Edinburgh, this week issued its projection of future manufacturing sectors in Europe.\nLargely because oil and gas is in decline, it showed Britain as one of only two countries, with Italy, where production is on track to decline.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, industrial and regional policies went hand in hand, and got themselves a bad name. In the Sixties, Harold Wilson's Labour government picked industries and locations for them that had more to do with rising unemployment and politics than financial viability.\nRavenscraig had already been chosen as the heart of the steel industry in Scotland. There had been clear advice to locate a new, integrated steel works near a deepwater port, for import of iron ore and export of the steely stuff.\nColvilles, the firm that dominated Lanarkshire steel-making before nationalisation, thought differently.  So did the government. Because steel workers were already in Lanarkshire, it was required that the new steel works should be where the steel communities were. The iron ore should come to them, which until 1978, meant small ships unloading at a rail terminus in central Glasgow.\nThe government wanted a strip mill to supply the industries it wished to see develop in Scotland. It decided that the plan for an integrated strip mill should be split between Scotland and South Wales.\nWhat's worth noting about this is that the Prime Minister who made the announcement was Harold Macmillan, a Conservative.\nIt's also worth a brief pause to wonder if the 'Craig steel works had been located at Grangemouth or Hunterston, requiring the workforce to move, the rest might not have been consigned to Scotland's industrial history.\nOther big industrial plants from the 1960s came and went. Linwood car plant and Bathgate trucks and buses are \"no more\", as the Proclaimers' song goes, or at least they are utterly changed, into a retail park and commuter housing.\nIn the Highlands, Invergordon in Easter Ross, and Corpach, near Fort William, joined Dounreay as the government's designated industrial hubs. Neither aluminium nor paper were to perform as hoped at the two ends of the Great Glen.\nBut as 1 November 2015 is the 50th anniversary of the Highlands and Islands Development Board starting its work, it is worth noting that this government response to de-population and decline was the starting point for a highly successful renaissance of the whole region, even without big industrial plants. \"Lochaber no more\"? No more. And more on that before long.\nIn the 1970s, industrial policy became associated with nationalisation of old, loss-making industries as they lost markets to more efficient competitors far away.\nPoor management, terrible industrial relations and inept political interference gave intervention and industrial policy a bad name.\nAnd that was the launch pad for the market-driven 1980s, replacing the old industries with the service sector, and especially finance.  Not only were the old heavy industries privatised, but so were the new ones. The government stake in (at that time) the young industry of offshore oil, was sold off.\nContrast that with our North Sea neighbour. For all the talk of Norway's enormous fund from keeping the proceeds of North Sea oil, there's little discussion now of how much better Norway has done by holding on to a very large portion of the equity in its offshore assets, as well as its tax take from them. Statoil is anything but a lumbering nationalised dinosaur.\nOther European countries have done significantly better than Britain at transforming old industrial heartlands. That's according to Professor Andrew Cumbers at Glasgow University, whose research into Germany, France and the UK makes uncomfortable reading for the economic departments in Whitehall.\nThey chose the strategic manufacturing industries they wanted, and made sure they were protected and provided with investment.\nThis was not with simple subsidy for losses incurred, but with state-controlled industrial investment banks, willing to take the long view with much cheaper and more attractive lending conditions than UK firms. In Germany, these banks were usually regional.\nSo both an industrial and regional policy combined to ensure that strategic industries survived and often thrived. Professor Cumbers points out that successful developed countries have retained their own steel-making sectors, including the Netherlands, Belgium and the USA.\nTotal output went up faster in the Old Industrial Regions of the UK, but employment growth was in the service sector rather than helping the march of the makers.\nCumbers also points to a weakness of the UK's dependence on inward investment - that when companies contract, foreign headquarters are more willing to sacrifice distant plants. The fate of Britain's steel industry currently rests on decisions made in corporate headquarters in Bangkok and Mumbai.\nRecent decades show that the relative decline of manufacturing with the growth of the service sector is a widespread phenomenon that accompanies economic development.\nEconomic theory says you shouldn't need to make your steel locally if it can be more efficiently produced elsewhere and imported. Britain is a very rare example of a country that seems willing to put that theory to the test.\nAnd given that it maintains a shipbuilding capacity on the Clyde to protect its strategic security interests - in being able to build warships for the Royal Navy - it is odd that it does not also insist on protection for the steel industry that supplies the Govan and Scotstoun yards.","summary":"There's a retro vibe afoot: the planned mothballing of two steel plants in Lanarkshire brings back the 1980s as if it were... well, 30 years ago."}

{"id":"23419036","document":"Scientists found that the long dry spell that year - the UK's most intense drought between 1914 and 2006 - killed off many drought-sensitive beech trees.\nGrowth of the trees is still restricted more than 30 years later, a study in the journal Functional Ecology said.\nThe more drought-tolerant Sessile Oak survived better and is now dominating the beech.\nThe scientific work was carried out at Lady Wood Park in the Wye Valley. This 45 hectare (111 acre) site is a national nature reserve and is attractive to researchers because it has been deliberately unmanaged since 1945.\nDetailed forest surveys have been carried out in the park over the past 70 years and the ecologists were able to use these along with tree ring data to discover how the different tree species fared over the period.\nBefore 1976, beech was the dominant species in this area. But that summer's drought has permanently changed the makeup of the forest.\nThat dry spell was the most exceptional drought in the years between 1914 and 2006 - it was 30% more intense than the next driest year, 1921.\nThe researchers found that in the period immediately after 1976, there was a significant growth in beech mortality. Between 1977 and 1992, 17% of these trees died, while there were no deaths among the oaks.\n\"The beech growth dropped very suddenly,\" said Prof Alistair Jump from the University of Stirling who carried out the work along with researchers from Joint Nature Conservation Committee.\n\"The Sessile Oak which is slightly less competitive but is more drought tolerant took advantage and grew much better - and beech has never fully recovered in the system.\"\nThe researchers say the oaks increased their growth rate by approximately 20% in the years immediately after 1976. The beech trees eventually stabilised their growth rate but only at around 75% of pre-drought levels.\nThe scientists say that beech trees can appear to tolerate drought without a long term impact until a threshold is reached.\n\"I think tipping point is a key idea, and that's something that we see very clearly in the work,\" said Prof Jump.\n\"They are resistant up to a point and then we hit a tipping point and the system shows very severe impacts.  The problem is we don't know where these tipping points are for other species.\"\nThe researchers say they expect the changes that they recorded at Lady Park Wood to have been replicated across the UK.\nThis perspective is echoed by Ray Townsend, arboretum manager at the Royal Botanic Gardens, at Kew.\nHe lived through the drought of 1976 and owns a home in the New Forest and he has been spending a good deal of time among the beech trees there in recent months.\n\"Quite clearly you can see that the beech aren't happy,\" he told BBC News.\n\"You can see evidence of the restriction of growth - I've seen that, the beech don't look as they should look - The oaks seem to be growing well, I'd never really thought about the reasons, but reading the research paper, it makes sense in a way.\"\nThe study's authors believe that extreme events such as the drought of 1976 are likely to increase in frequency in the future and there could be similar implications for other tree species.\nTo cope with these events, they say that forest managers need to manipulate the mix of species in their woods.\nBut despite the extreme heat of the last few weeks, the scientists say that 2013 will not have the same impact on trees as the dry days of '76.  That year was exceptional as it followed on from a rain-free 1975.\n\"This summer it won't happen,\" said Prof Jump.\n\"Last year we were at the point where we were forecast to exceed the 1976 drought and then we had this phenomenal amount of rain  - that replenished the water supplies and that means for this year it would be highly unlikely.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.","summary":"The sizzling summer of 1976 caused permanent changes to British forests, new research suggests."}

A group of Assam Company's estates lost its certification because \"it was found to be in breach of critical criteria relating to the use of personal protective equipment\", the Rainforest Alliance said in a statement.\nThe Assam Company said the loss of its certification was because of a \"minor error\" on one estate - Hajua - while spraying a plant extract, which it understood did not require personal protective equipment. It said that because the Assam company estates operate in a \"single cluster\", the other estates were automatically decertified.\nTwinings, Taylors of Harrogate and Fortnum & Mason have suspended business with the company while Harrods took the tea off its shelves shortly after the investigation, which was broadcast in September.\nWorkers at the company's Hajua estate were seen spraying agrochemicals without the protective equipment employers are required to provide, when the BBC visited.\nMen spraying reported breathing difficulties, numbness of the hands and face, a burning sensation on the skin and profound loss of appetite.\nThe Rainforest Alliance said its auditor confirmed the BBC's evidence of unsafe spraying and the organisation had tightened its rules on the subject.\nTaylors of Harrogate said it will maintain a relationship with the estates and support efforts to improve standards.\nTwinings plans to continue working with the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) - an organisation set up by UK tea companies to improve workers' lives - to monitor the working and living conditions on all the tea estates from which it buys. It also plans to conduct a review of the Assam estates it sources from in the next few months.\nBecause of the way ETP and the Rainforest Alliance work together, a Rainforest suspension automatically results in a suspension of ETP certification.\nFortnum & Mason says it will not buy from Assam Company until its \"problems have been successfully resolved and they are once again Ethical Tea Partnership certified\".\nThe original investigation also found workers on a number of Assam estates and plantations belonging to other producers living in broken houses with terrible sanitation.\nThe Assam Company said it was \"committed to the practices of sustainability and work to this end is in progress, with most of the work on housing, latrines and creche being planned after the closure of the plucking season, in December to March.\" It said this had been company practice for \"many years\".\nThe Rainforest Alliance has ordered improvements to living conditions on two other plantations, owned by the world's biggest tea producer, McLeod Russel.\nThe Moran and Behora tea estates supply the companies that own PG Tips and Tetley, as well as Twinings.\nMany workers were found to be living in leaking homes, without electricity. Many of the latrines had been blocked or broken for many years and families said they had no choice but to defecate among the tea bushes.\nA manager on the Moran estate admitted there was \"a huge backlog of repairs\" but the Rainforest Alliance did not decertify McLeod Russel's Assam estates because decent housing and sanitation were \"not critical criteria\".\nHowever, the Rainforest Alliance has admitted flaws in its audit process and last month made its criteria more demanding. Now any estates failing to provide adequate housing, water supply and sanitation will lose their green frog seal of approval.\nThe Rainforest Alliance has given Mcleod Russel two months to improve conditions for tea workers on the Moran and Behora plantations.\nUnilever, which makes PG Tips, told the BBC it welcomes the fact that improvements on areas like housing and health and safety are being accelerated and will be subject to additional monitoring.\nTata, which makes Tetley, said it has met with the producers to understand their plans to address the issues the BBC uncovered. It has been in discussion with the Rainforest Alliance and says it is committed to the fair and ethical treatment of people across its supply chain.\nMcLeod Russel says work on homes and sanitation on its Moran tea estate has now been accelerated and will be completed by March.

{"id":"39401569","document":"Southgate was delighted with aspects of England's display in defeat in the friendly against Germany in Dortmund on Wednesday while the unspectacular win against Lithuania was all about getting three more points towards World Cup qualification.\nSo what will Southgate take away from the last week as England look ahead to their next qualifier in Scotland on 10 June?\nSouthgate set the normal rules about strikers and age aside to bring 34-year-old Jermain Defoe back into the England fold four years after his last goal for his country, scored in a victory against San Marino.\nInjuries to main striker Harry Kane and all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney forced Southgate's hand but he was able to call on the hard evidence provided by Defoe's 14 Premier League goals in a Sunderland side renowned for not making chances and rooted to the bottom of the table.\nDefoe has always traded in the game's most important currency, goals, throughout his lengthy career. This was a performance designed to demonstrate to doubters and Southgate he has not outlived his usefulness at international level.\nHe was sharp and saw one chance saved before he demonstrated his poacher's instinct in the penalty area to slide in Adam Lallana's pass in the 21st minute before flashing another shot narrowly off target.\nIn many respects he is an old-fashioned attacking operator in that his first thought is always the back of the net and shooting at it. No extra touches or passes are required. Defoe had two shots on target, one off target and one blocked with very limited opportunities - but most significantly made England's breakthrough.\nHe is selfish in just the right way and in a World Cup qualifying group where England will be confronted by the sort of mass defence Lithuania presented here, it is unlikely this will be a temporary return to the colours.\nDele Alli was given heavy-handed - or more precisely heavy-footed - treatment from Lithuania as they tried to light the short fuse that has brought Tottenham's 20-year-old some unsavoury headlines in his short career.\nIt meant Alli was nowhere near as influential as he was in Dortmund on Wednesday, where his efforts will have imprinted his importance for both the present and the future in Southgate's mind.\nWith Alli subdued, this was the chance for Liverpool's Adam Lallana to step forward and confirm his progression into a fully-fledged first-choice member of this England side.\nThe 28-year-old is a late developer for England but his rejuvenation under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is now reaping dividends for Southgate as a very important spin-off.\nLallana has been directly involved in four goals in his last five England appearances, three goals and one assist, and was unlucky to strike the post in Germany.\nHe combined natural energy and creation with subtlety at Wembley, the qualities needed to make a difference in an attacking framework with England - with his beautiful, imaginative touch inside a crowded penalty the perfect invitation for Jamie Vardy to make the game safe against Lithuania.\nIf his Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson and Tottenham's Eric Dier can provide a solid midfield shield for England's defence and freedom for those further forward, Southgate will hope Alli and Lallana will flourish even more on the road to Russia.\nJermain Defoe showed exactly what a natural goalscorer can bring to England - which is why Southgate will want Tottenham's Harry Kane restored to full fitness as soon as possible.\nEngland have players who can score goals, as Vardy also proved, with Wayne Rooney not willing to take a back seat yet and youngsters such as Marcus Rashford ready to stake their claim.\nBut Kane, still only 23 and with 19 goals and four assists for Spurs in the Premier League this season, is the class act Southgate will want fully recovered from his ankle injury to spearhead England through the rest of the campaign.\nKane, and he was not alone here, endured a miserable Euro 2016 perhaps memorable only for then manager Roy Hodgson's puzzling decision to put a proven goalscorer (and a tall proven goalscorer at that) on corner-taking duty.\nHe has endured a dry spell with England, with five goals in 17 appearances, but his performances at club level this season have shown further maturity and he has the sort of mature and measured personality that could yet mark him out as a future England captain.\nKane is currently recovering from ankle ligament damage and is weeks away from full fitness - but in the long-term he will be a centrepiece of Southgate's plans as the man to take the opportunities England missed in Germany and against Lithuania.\nBurnley's Michael Keane has been the beneficiary of Gareth Southgate's willingness to move outside the Premier League elite with his selection policy and the opportunities that can suddenly present themselves at international level.\nKeane moved up the England pecking order when Phil Jones hurt his toe in collision with Manchester United team-mate Chris Smalling and had to withdraw from the squad before the Germany game - and got another chance following his fine debut with Gary Cahill suspended and Smalling an injury casualty for the Lithuania qualifer.\nThe 24-year-old slotted in perfectly to a three-man defence alongside Smalling and Cahill in Germany and was an able partner to John Stones against Lithuania, although the lack of serious attacking threat from England's opposition in Sunday's game must be used as context.\nKeane has, however, given the impressive initial impression that he has the composure and concentration for international football and has been one of the major positives for Southgate and England this week.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOnce again England's route to a major tournament does not seem to have an obstacle in sight - a familiar journey to what might prove to be a dangerous final destination.\nEngland and Southgate have no excuses for failing to progress to Russia from a group containing Slovakia, Slovenia, Scotland, Lithuania and Malta and all the evidence suggests it will be as straightforward as expected.\nIt was the same under former manager Roy Hodgson and England's untroubled qualifying campaign for Euro 2016, which brought an unblemished 10 wins out of 10 against Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino.\nEngland set off for France with optimism but only recorded one win against Wales before the embarrassing exit against Iceland in the last 16.\nThe conundrum for Southgate is that the true measure of England's progress and test of how far they have come under his tutelage may only be revealed when they are faced with a higher-class of opposition in a competitive environment.\nOne of Southgate's major tasks between now and what looks like certain qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia is to find a way of discovering just how good this England team is - and how to uncover any flaws before the serious business begins.","summary":"Gareth Southgate will feel a sense of cautious optimism after his first two matches as permanent England manager in succession to Sam Allardyce -

{"id":"14824435","document":"The 1.9-million-year-old fossils were first described in 2010, and given the species name Australopithecus sediba.\nBut the team behind the discovery has now come back with a deeper analysis.\nIt tells Science magazine that features seen in the brain, feet, hands and pelvis of A. sediba all suggest this species was on the direct evolutionary line to us - Homo sapiens.\n\"We have examined the critical areas of anatomy that have been used consistently for identifying the uniqueness of human beings,\" said Professor Lee Berger from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg\n\"Any one of these features could have evolved separately, but it is highly unlikely that all of them would have evolved together if A. sediba was not related to our lineage,\" the team leader informed BBC News.\nIt is a big claim and, if correct, would sideline other candidates in the fossil record for which similar assertions have been made in the past.\nTheory holds that modern humans can trace a line back to a creature known as Homo erectus which lived more than a million years ago. This animal, according to many palaeoanthropologists, may in turn have had its origins in more primitive hominins, as they are known, such as Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis.\nThe contention now made for A. sediba is that, although older than its \"rivals\", some of its anatomy and capabilities were more advanced than these younger forms. Put simply, it is a more credible ancestor for H. erectus, Berger's team claims.\nThe sediba specimens were unearthed at Malapa in the famous Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site, just to the northwest of Jo'burg.\nThey were pulled from a pit - a depression left in the ground by a cave complex that had lost its roof through erosion over time.\nIdentified as an adult female and a juvenile male, the two individuals were quite possibly mother and son.  What seems certain is that they died together in some tragic accident that saw them either fall into the cave complex or become stuck in it. After death, their bodies were washed into a pool and cemented in time along with the remains of many other animals that got trapped in the same way.\nIn the months since their 2010 announcement, Professor Berger and colleagues have subjected the remains to further detailed assessment.\nX-ray scans reveal ape-man's brain\nAge: The latest dating technologies were applied to the sediments encasing the fossils.  Whereas original estimates had put the age of the remains at somewhere between 1.78 and 1.95 million years old, the new analysis has narrowed this window of uncertainty to just 3,000 years. The new age is now between 1.977 and 1.98 million years old.  The refined dating is important, says the team, because it puts A. sediba deep enough in time to be a realistic ancestor to H. erectus.\nDr Robyn Pickering, from the University of Melbourne, Australia, who led the dating, told BBC News: \"This is a very interesting time in human evolution because it is when we think we should be seeing the beginnings of our genus, Homo.  Previously, we've had very few fossils from this time period, so the sediba fossils are remarkable in that they are so complete.\"\nBrain: A high-resolution X-ray scan of the male specimen's skull has produced a virtual cast of its braincase. This was carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble. From this, the researchers estimate an adult A. sediba's brain to have been about 440 cubic centimetres in volume, or about the size of a medium grapefruit. This is smaller than much older fossils in the record such as the famous \"Lucy\" specimen, Australopithecus afarensis (3.2 million years), but, intriguingly, the shape is more human-like, especially at the front.  This may hint at the start of the re-organisation of the brain that would be necessary to make us what we are today.\nPelvis: The pelvis is short and broad like a human pelvis.  A more ancient creature like Lucy has a flatter and more flaring pelvis. A popular idea has been that the modern human pelvis evolved in tandem with the gradual growth in brain volume - facilitating the birth of babies with bigger heads.  A. sediba gives the lie to this theory, says the team, because it had a modern-looking pelvis while possessing a small brain.\nHand: The right-hand of the female is very nearly complete.  It is looks far more like a modern human hand than an ape hand. Its fingers are shorter relative to the thumb than in a chimpanzee.  And yet, it appears to have possessed powerful muscles for grasping, suggesting A. sediba spent a lot of time clambering through the branches of trees. The team also argues that the dexterity would have been there to make simple tools.\nFoot: The ankle joint is mostly human-like in form and there is some evidence for a human-like arch and Achilles tendon. But A. sediba possessed an ape-like heel and lower tibia, or shin bone.  The scientists think this combination may have led to a distinctive type of walk when the creature was not climbing in trees.\nWhatever the correctness of the analysis, the creature certainly has a fascinating mix of features - some archaic, some modern.\nIndependent scientists describe the fossils as exquisite and utterly fascinating.\nDr William Harcourt-Smith from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, commented: \"One lineage of Australopithecus almost certainly led into the first member of our own genus called Homo, and from then eventually emerged modern humans.\n\"But some of them are side branches, and we're trying to work out which ones are and which ones aren't - and that's why this finding is so important. In many ways, these fossils are the 'smoking gun' just before the emergence of our own genus.\"\nAnd Professor Chris Stringer, from London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News: \"This isn't the end of the story. What may be happening is that there were several australopithecine forms all evolving human-like features in parallel as they turned to meat-eating and tool-making and moving greater distances.\n\"The question now is to pull out of this mess which one is really the ancestor of the genus Homo.  We know there are more remains to come from this incredible site.  Let's see if other individuals also show this mix of features.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk","summary":"The ancient remains of two human-like creatures found in South Africa could change the way we view our origins."}

And if you stand inside the tiny cell where South Africa's struggle icon spent 18 years hidden from the world, and peer through the barred window into the high-walled courtyard, you can just make out the thin strip of green and brown foliage where he once tended tomatoes and chillies.\n\"A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could control\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The sense of being the custodian of this small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom,\" Mr Mandela wrote in his autobiography, Long Walk To Freedom - an early draft of which, incidentally, he tried to hide from the prison guards by burying in the garden.\nToday, the garden's weeds - and the rotting stump of an apple tree - hint at the alleged mismanagement and corruption that have blighted Robben Island for years.\nBut along one wall, two grape vines now stand out in sharp contrast - the lush green foliage of a promising harvest suspended on a wooden frame.\n\"They're still growing, thriving, regardless of the difficult conditions on the island. They're very much a symbol of the resilience of the leaders imprisoned here,\" said Philip Jonker, a South African wine maker as he and two colleagues carefully pruned the vines by hand.\nIt is seven years since Mr Jonker first spotted the two plants on a family visit to the island.\nIt is not clear whether Mr Mandela himself tended the vines or whether, as seems more likely, they were planted shortly after he was transferred to another prison on the mainland. But Mr Jonker sees them - there are seven vines around the prison in total - as part of the island's heritage, and a way of preserving \"South African history in a bottle\".\nAfter four years of petitioning, he finally secured permission to tend the vines, and, last year, to take the first harvest - previous ones had been devoured by the island's ravenous birds - back to his Weltevrede family wine estate two hours' drive east of Cape Town.\nAt this moment - leaving aside the current headlines about low pay and grim conditions in the local wine industry  - you may be wondering if this is simply another potentially uncomfortable attempt to exploit the Mandela \"brand\".\nThe short answer is no.

Hold on a minute, did someone say introverted?\n\"I've got this reputation of being confident, yet I go and do all these psychology tests and I'm an introvert,\" Pietersen tells his former team-mate Andrew Flintoff in an interview to be aired on BBC Radio 5 live on Tuesday at 20:30 BST.\nSource: ESPN Cricinfo\n\"I'm very much an introverted person. I like my own company, my own family. I don't really go out much.\n\"I think the confidence has grown from what I've achieved on the cricket field but I'm not as confident as anybody thinks.\"\nThe disarming revelation is one of many in Pietersen's fascinating chat with Flintoff, a player with whom he occasionally clashed during the years they shared an England dressing room.\nIn it, Pietersen talks about growing up in South Africa unaware of what the Ashes were, his see-saw relationship with Shane Warne, his ill-fated spell as captain and his regret over the silly shots that have left him looking \"a complete mug\" at times.\nHe opens up about England captains past and present, relives the anguish of injuries and loss of form and reaffirms his ambition to clock up 10,000 Test runs.\nLike many top sportsmen, Pietersen is public property, someone we think we know much better than we actually do.\nThis interview goes behind the bling and the bravado to reveal an insecurity over his image, a recognition of his faults, a light-heartedness - he calls Flintoff \"chubby\" at one point - and perhaps less surprisingly, an absolute obsession with his performance on the field of play.\nAfter leaving South Africa in protest against the racial quota system - which insisted on a certain number of non-white players in every team - and qualifying to play for England through the Kolpak rule, Pietersen announced himself with three one-day centuries against the country of his birth in early 2005.\nHe went on to play a decisive role in England's historic Ashes victory over Australia later that year, making back-to-back fifties on his Test debut at Lord's and sealing the series with a breathtaking 158 at The Oval.\nThe sheer audacity with which Pietersen took on the team that had dominated the game for more than a decade was jaw-dropping, but as he reveals to Flintoff, his close relationship with Australian talisman Warne - they were team-mates at Hampshire - was one of the major reasons why he settled so quickly into Ashes cricket.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Having the great Shane Warne as my mate, walking onto the field and not having him hammer me from first slip, but just laugh and have a joke helped a lot,\" says Pietersen.\n\"I think I could have been fearful playing Australia but because this huge figure was a mate of mine, it calmed things down.\"\nThere was nothing calm about the celebrations that followed England's Ashes win as the players famously partied the night away before arriving at a Downing Street reception the next morning somewhat the worse for wear.\nOne photograph shows a sozzled-looking Flintoff and Pietersen arm in arm outside Number 10, the former with eyelids sagging over reddened pupils and the latter looking bedraggled with a loose tie, sunglasses and a haircut which he jokingly refers to as \"the skunk\".\nAs they reminisce over the mayhem, Pietersen is less certain than Flintoff that he would do the same again.\n\"The reason I don't enjoy [looking back] is that I can't remember it,\" he says.\n\"We probably deserved it because we had just beaten Australia and I think winning series like that need to be enjoyed but I also remember beating Australia in Australia and winning the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean and thinking 'do you know what, just enjoy it, just walk around and take it in'.\nJuly\n10-14 1st Test, Trent Bridge (11:00 BST)\n18-22 2nd Test, Lord's (11:00 BST)\nAugust\n1-5 3rd Test, Old Trafford (11:00 BST)\n9-13 4th Test, Chester-le-Street (11:00 BST)\n21-25 5th Test, The Oval (11:00 BST)\n29 1st Twenty20 international, Southampton (18:30 BST)\n31 2nd Twenty20 international, Chester-le-Street (14:30 BST)\nSeptember\n6 1st ODI, Headingley (10:15 BST)\n8 2nd ODI, Old Trafford (10:15 BST)\n11 3rd ODI, Edgbaston (14:00 BST)\n14 4th ODI, Cardiff (10:15 BST)\n16 5th ODI, Southampton (14:00 BST)\nNB Fixtures and start times are subject to change. The BBC is not responsible for any changes that may be made\n\"I will never forget Barbados, and I will never forget Sydney. In 2005 the emotions took over and we ended up all over the place that evening, but I haven't done it that way since.\"\nAfter the boozing came the backlash, and the painful memory for both players of the 5-0 whitewash by Australia in the return Ashes series down under. With Warne now very much foe not friend, and Flintoff struggling with the demands of captaincy, England were blown away.\n\"When Australia were looking at what had gone wrong in 2005 one of the things they put it down to was Warne's relationship with me and they said that had to change,\" says Pietersen, 33.\n\"He threw the ball twice at me in Brisbane and our discussions got really, really personal in the middle. Off the field he called me Kevin, not KP or PK. It had totally changed.\"\nDespite the provocation from Warne, Pietersen enjoyed a prolific series with the bat, averaging more than 54. His reaction to the defeat, however, hinted at the friction with his team-mates that flared up so spectacularly last year.\n\"I was extremely disappointed - I didn't deal with it the right way,\" he admits.\n\"I don't think I related to it in Australia - because I got 500 runs and I was thinking 'why did we get smashed?' I don't think that went down well with some people.\"\nIn one of the most introspective sections of the interview, Pietersen explains that he learnt to deal with the failings of his team-mates when he was going through a bad patch of his own in 2010.\n\"Until you go through the depths of despair as a sportsman you don't understand the good stuff or the bad stuff,\" he says.\n\"The hardest time was on a Bangladesh tour in 2010. I didn't know which end of the bat to hold. I just couldn't hit the ball and I ended up sitting on a bus and thinking 'where is my career going to go?'\"\nFortunately for England, a spell in South Africa with his mentor Graham Ford soon put things right and set Pietersen up for one of the most prolific periods of his career.\nThere was a double-hundred in Adelaide in England's 3-1 Ashes triumph in 2010-11, another at Lord's in the 4-0 whitewash of India in 2011, and four more hundreds before a knee injury sidelined him in March.\nThey included the defiant 149 against South Africa at Headingley last year, before the discovery of his \"provocative\" text messages to the opposition dressing room saw him dropped for the final Test at Lord's, and the brilliant 186 against India in Mumbai that confirmed his \"reintegration\" into the England side.\nThat century was Pietersen's 22nd in Tests, briefly taking him alongside Wally Hammond, Colin Cowdrey, Geoffrey Boycott and current captain Alastair Cook at the top of England's all-time list.\nPietersen describes the less extravagant but more consistent Cook - who has since taken his own tally of tons to 25 - as \"such a nice guy\" who will go down as \"one of the greatest cricketers in terms of statistics to have ever played the game\".\nAs for his own legacy, in a closing passage to the interview tinged with regret, he concedes that his tendency towards showmanship may leave him short of his ultimate ambitions.\n\"I've always said I just want to get the best out of my talent and when I've finished my career I just want to say I've done the best that I possibly could,\" he explains.\n\"But I know that because of the way I play I'm not going to have done the best I could because I get myself out for 20, 40, 60 or 70 all the time. That will be the man on the shoulder that says I think you've done OK, but\u2026\"\nKP, in his own words. Introverted? No chance. Interesting?

{"id":"38915466","document":"With the windows down, I sang along to cheesy Mediterranean songs on the radio, watching the scenery flash by.\nBut I was there to make a documentary about Europe dancing to a worrying tune - popular discontent, fear, anger and, in many corners, an absence of hope.\nThere is always a section in society that feels abandoned or ignored by their government, but after the 2008 crash, the bank bailouts, the migrant crises and a string of terror attacks, a growing number of Europeans have felt unprotected, exposed and worried for the future of their families.\nAnd the answer to their fears? Well if my Fiat 500 were Europe - bear with me on this one - it would be hesitating at a crossroads.\nThe signpost pointing one way reads Angela Merkel. And in the opposite direction, Marine Le Pen.\nThese two determined women, tough and seasoned politicians, both standing for election this year, hope to drag their own countries and Europe as a whole down dramatically different paths.\nA passionate European and Christian Democrat, mindful of the horrors of her country's Nazi and Cold War past, Ms Merkel is increasingly viewed as the continent's number one defender of liberal values. Barack Obama pointedly chose to visit her in Berlin on his last official trip abroad before handing over the presidency to Donald Trump.\nMs Le Pen, on the other hand, is the poster child of Europe's new wave of populism. She demands what she described to me in an interview as a \"new world order\". A new France, a new Europe, free, she says, of the \"prison\" of the European Union and the \"artificial\" joining of European nations.\nShe laughed at those wringing their hands on both sides of the Atlantic over the Trump Presidency.\nBrexit, Trump and Europe's new \"patriotic leaders\" in Ms Le Pen's words, are merely the end of one world and the start of a new one where, in her opinion, the people and the nation state are strong and don't answer to what she called \"Globalisationists\".\nGone are the days in the not so distant past when national elections met a wall of public indifference - 2017 has been dubbed 'Election Year' in Europe, with key EU nations Germany, France, the Netherlands and possibly Italy heading to the polls.\nWith populist parties standing strong, those for and against them feel motivated to vote. And not just with their pockets in mind. The famous campaign slogan, \"it's the economy, stupid\", associated with Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential bid, is no longer pertinent.\nLook at the Netherlands - holding an election next month. The economy there is on the up and unemployment is down. But rather than flocking around their centrist prime minister, voters are flirting with anti-immigration, Eurosceptic populist, Geert Wilders.\nWherever you look at the moment in Europe - north, south, east and west - there are populist parties shouting loudly from the sidelines.\nThe Five Star Movement is Italy's most talked-about political party right now. They listen to people, they say, not Big Business, and their message is captivating the country's disenchanted, from all ages and backgrounds.\n\"Populism is a beautiful world,\" Beppe Grillo, the figurehead of the movement, told me. \"I am proud to be a populist. It means we are saying No! No! and No! and we will win the next election.\"\nA nostalgic nationalist, anti-immigration, vein runs through most of Europe's populist parties but their policies vary from country to country. It is incorrect to describe them all as \"far right\".\nEven the parties which have deep roots in the extreme right, such as Austria's Freedom Party or Ms Le Pen's Front National, have tried to broaden their appeal, declaring they are of the people, not right or left.\n\"Au nom du peuple\" (in the name of the people) is the banner under which Ms Le Pen is running her presidential campaign in France.\nAnd after the Francois Fillon fiasco in France, with the centre-right's presidential candidate damaged by corruption allegations, Ms Le Pen has a chance of making it to her country's highest political office.\nAnd that would be a dramatic turning point for Europe - she says she wants out of the euro and probably of the EU. \"Frexit\" could bring down the whole EU like a house of cards.\nIn Brussels, even insiders admit the EU is in a battle to survive. Before stepping down as president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz told me there was a \"real risk\" that the EU would fall apart.\nVice President of the European Commission Federica Mogherini said: \"We have something that the entire world regards as a miracle. We have an enormous strength and we spend our time talking about our own crisis.\"\nNext month is the EU's 60th birthday, with lavish celebrations planned in Rome. But outside the birthday party gates the EU's existence is being seriously questioned.\nAnd there is a global significance to all this too. Europe's populists are for the most part big fans of Presidents Putin and Trump, and a weak, fractured Europe works for both men.\nWith many Europeans nervous about the Trump presidency and with so much at stake, it could be that even angry voters feel safer sticking with the political mainstream this year.\nBut predict at your peril. Polls have proved unreliable. Europe's voters are in a volatile mood.\nYou can watch After Brexit: the Battle for Europe on BBC Two on Thursday 9 February, 21:00 GMT.","summary":"My shiny red rental Fiat 500 wound its way up and round the narrow, olive-tree lined lanes like a ladybird humming through the Tuscan countryside."}
{"id":"32397755","document":"The state oil firm's technicians discovered one of the world's largest oil reserves deep beneath the seabed - under miles of layers of salt.\nAnd then two years later, it struck gold again, finding yet another giant oil reserve.\nOptimism was running high. The firm went to the markets and raised over $70bn - the world's largest share issue ever.\nBrazil's economy was at cruising speed too, finally taking off after years of meagre growth.\nBut the good times did not last long - for neither the company nor the country. A massive corruption scandal last year eroded much of Petrobras's market value.\nBrazil's economy too has been on a downward spiral - with high inflation, slow growth and low confidence.\nSo how did it all go so wrong, so fast?\nPetrobras's oil bonanza and Brazil's emerging star status are fairly recent phenomena.\nJust a few decades ago, prospects were dire for both.\nIn the early 1990s, Brazil was a young democracy in deep economic trouble.\nAnnualised inflation was running close to 5,000%. Decades of protectionism meant there was little competition in most sectors and many national firms had become inefficient.\nPetrobras was seen as part of that landscape by many who wanted to privatise it.\nOne critic used to refer to it as \"Petrossauro\" - a large, outdated structure that moved slowly and was doomed to extinction in the modern world.\nBrazil's fortunes started to change in the mid-1990s - both internally and externally.\nThrough reforms, successive governments were able to defeat hyperinflation, open up Brazil's economy to the world and redistribute growth, lifting millions out of poverty.\nA decade of global economic boom favoured Brazil's champion exports - commodities like coffee, soya, beef and oil.\nBrazil's oil sector was opened to foreign companies, but local laws made sure Petrobras kept its role at the top of every major project.\nA decade of high international oil prices helped give a great boost to the firm's investment plans.\nBy 2010 - after all oil discoveries - it felt like Brazil and Petrobras had finally \"arrived\" at the top.\nBut then things took a turn for the worse.\nOne problem was Petrobras's desperate need for cash.\nBrazil's treasure trove is buried deep below the pre-salt layer and can only be extracted with expensive methods.\nPresident Dilma Rousseff was adamant that Petrobras should play a major role in all fields, although it did not have the resources to do it alone.\nSo the company sought to attract partners and raise money abroad by selling many of its assets.\nJust as it was taking on its biggest financial challenge ever, Petrobras was hit by a recurrent obstacle in Brazil's history: corruption.\nAn investigation by Brazil's Federal Police revealed that the state oil giant was being used illegally as a cash cow for most parties in the government coalition.\nIts top executives are all politically appointed by the government.\nThey allegedly handed out Petrobras contracts in exchange for party donations and bribes.\nA string of high-profile arrests were made - from top Brazilian CEOs to the treasurer of Rousseff's ruling party.\nMore than 40 key politicians are under investigation, including the presidents of both houses of Congress.\nConfidence in the company eroded almost overnight - both in the markets and in the streets.\nIts own CEO was sacked for not being able to handle the crisis.\nTens of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets against President Rousseff - who chaired the board of Petrobras for much of the period when the alleged bribes happened.\nIt could not have come at a worse time for Brazil's economy.\nIt is stuck in low gear, now that the commodity boom seems to be over, and its goods are no longer in high demand.\nUntil last year, the government had been trying to navigate through the crisis by raising spending and pumping money into the economy.\nThe pre-salt layer is made up of rock that was laid down millions of years ago before a layer of salt - which can be thousands of metres thick - accumulated above it.\nSome of the oil formed in the pre-salt layer has not leaked up into the layers above.\nThis oil is often of good quality, but is buried so deep that access to it is difficult.\nAccording to Petrobras, there may be 50 billion barrels of oil in the pre-salt layer found in the Brazilian continental shelf.\nPetrobras itself was used as an instrument of that policy.\nThe state oil firm controls the internal price of fuel, and for three years it helped Brazilians get cheaper petrol.\nBut the subsidies hurt the company at a time when it needed all the cash it could get for its pre-salt project.\nNow the government has done a u-turn in its policy, going radically from stimulus to austerity.\nIn the past, Petrobras has helped the government get through downturns, as its investments alone represent 2% of Brazilian Gross National Product.\nBut now it is making matters even worse.\nOne study by FGV Business School suggests the fall of Petrobras investment could knock about $30bn off the Brazilian economy, with more than a million jobs lost, mostly in construction.\nPetrobras and Brazil have been trying to react to the crisis with a push for transparency.\nLater this month, it will replace some politicians in its board of directors with respected market figures, like the president of mining giant Vale, Murilo Ferreira.\nThe energy minister has even signalled that the government might ease access to pre-salt projects for foreign firms, reducing the burden on Petrobras.\nSome say Brazil has learned some lessons.\n\"If you concentrate everything - all wealth - in a single company controlled by the state then it is very easy for the political system to go there and try to grab resources,\", says Sergio Lazzarini, an academic at Insper Business School.\n\"You can avoid this with more competition, more transparency, more regulation.\"\nBrazil and Petrobras still have a difficult path to follow.\nMost economists predict Brazil will be in recession this year.\nAnd the corruption scandal is far from over, as no-one has been tried yet.\nPresident Rousseff insists Brazil and Petrobras will be stronger after this crisis, as historic corruption is finally being investigated after decades of omission.\nBrazilians hope she is right, but the mood in the country is bleak.\nAfter decades of low expectations, Brazilians had come to think in recent years that the nation was finally emerging into the world stage as a global power, only to see it again stuck with corruption and low growth.\nWhile many still recognise the country is much better off than in the years of hyperinflation and \"Petrossauro\", optimism has now been largely replaced by scepticism and impatience.\nBrazil's treasure trove, it seems, will take a while longer to dig out.","summary":"In 2008, Petrobras and its main stakeholder -

both currently based in London - to be moved out of the UK after Brexit.\nThe three motions - along with amendments - will be put to a vote on Thursday.\nAt lunchtime, MEPs will decide whether to support an agreement to allow Europol to conclude data-sharing powers with Denmark after it quits the body.\nDenmark is due to leave the EU police co-operation agency in May, when it is due to acquire a raft of new powers.\nContinued membership would have required Denmark to end opt-outs on certain EU legislation -

the UK, Ireland and Denmark will not have to apply them.\nAfter this they will debate proposals to increase checks at the external border of the passport-free Schengen area.\nThe new law would require travellers to be checked against Interpol's stolen and lost travel documents database (SLTD) and the Schengen Information System.\nThe new requirements will also be put to a vote on Thursday.\nIn the evening, MEPs will debate a report from the legal affairs committee which calls for new EU legislation in the field of robotics.\nThe committee's suggestions are not binding on the EU Commission, which would have to propose any new laws in this area.\nAmong its many recommendations, the draft report suggests creating a new EU agency to register advanced robots and give advice to national regulators.\nAfter a debate on the EU's 2015 strategy for the civil aviation sector, MEPs will debate their usual three motions on human rights cases.\nThis month's picks relate to Nicaragua, executions in Kuwait and Bahrain and activists in Guatemala.\nAfter the expected ratification of the CETA deal the day before, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is due to speak from 10.00 GMT.\nThe reports on robotics and the future direction of the EU, as well as the legislation on border checks and terror offences, will be voted on after that.\nThe afternoon's only short debate will see MEPs debate the Commission's recent agreement with Germany on its planned road tolls.\nIn 2015 the German Parliament approved a law that allowed German-registered cars to get a deduction on the charge on their annual vehicle tax bill.\nMEPs have tabled an oral question questioning whether the EU executive was right to suspend its anti-discrimination court case given the scale of the amendments to the plan agreed with Berlin.\nPlease note: This agenda is subject to modification at the opening of the session on Monday afternoon.\nA guide to how the European Parliament's plenary sessions can be found here.","summary":"After seven years of talks, MEPs will finally decide whether to ratify the EU's trade deal with Canada during their plenary sitting in Strasbourg this week."}

Why shouldn't the demand of pension funds for long-term income streams be satisfied if there are no clear losers?

{"id":"34921212","document":"It was widely anticipated the Spending Review would confirm the need for police efficiencies would remain at the top of the agenda, at least until 2020.\nThe Home Office is not one of the favoured \"protected\" ministries shielded from cuts.\nAnd as 71% of its gross spending goes on crime and policing, that is where most of the department's cuts have bitten.\nAdd to that Home Secretary Theresa May's determination to reform policing, and there was a strong sense the government would not change course.\nThat was certainly the expectation at Manchester Town Hall, where chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) had gathered for their annual joint conference.\nAt 12:30, a large group of them took their places around a television set in a room set aside for exhibitors to watch the chancellor's statement. The mood was sombre. Most chiefs and PCCs had been planning for cuts of 20-25%.\nThe Inspectorate of Constabulary had suggested that by 2018, forces would have to shed at least 12,000 officer, staff and police community support officer (PCSO) posts, with further reductions after that.\nThe inspectorate, known for its careful, measured commentary, warned some forces might not be able to withstand another round of cuts, because they were not efficient enough. It said the \"operational viability\" of some could be \"in jeopardy\".\nThe National Police Chiefs Council, which co-ordinates the work of forces, feared the job losses would be even worse - 35,000 by 2020, which, Sara Thornton, who chairs the council, said in July, would be a \"game changer\".\nConstabularies with large urban areas stood to lose the most, as they tend to rely more on Home Office funding, among them Northumbria, which gets 85% of its income from central government, and the West Midlands, 83%.\nSo, when the announcement came, towards the end of Mr Osborne's statement, that there would be no further policing cuts, there was genuine disbelief, mixed with delight.\nKevin Hurley, Surrey's PCC, described the atmosphere as \"euphoric\", as though England had won the World Cup.\nEssex Chief Constable Steve Kavanagh held his hand over his mouth in shock. \"I'm aghast,\" he said.\nAt moments such as this, journalists reach for the official documents to look at the small print. Could it really be true?\nThe Treasury statement appears unequivocal. \"The government will protect overall police spending in line with inflation - an increase of \u00c2\u00a3900m by 2019-20,\" it says.\nThe Home Office press release, however, says the funding will enable individual forces to maintain their budgets at current cash levels.\nThat means each force will not automatically get enough money to keep pace with inflation. They will get the same in 2019-20 as they are getting this year.\nInstead, extra funding will be distributed in certain specialist policing areas - firearms, tackling cybercrime and child sexual exploitation, some of which might be dealt with regionally - as well as to forces that demonstrate efficiencies.\nIt is that extra funding that enables the government to say overall police funding is going up in real terms.\nIn other words, the Home Office has accepted arguments that some aspects of policing need more central co-ordination and constabularies that come up with viable efficiency plans should be rewarded. It is called \"top slicing\" - and that is quite a major change, and one it is easy to overlook amid the relief there are to be no cuts.\nThe other announcement, which has been broadly welcomed, is PCCs will get more \"flexibility\" to raise funds for policing from the council tax policing levy, known as the precept.\nUntil now, the government has limited how much PCCs can raise through the precept, by restricting annual increases in England to under 2%. Rises higher than that require a referendum. Different rules apply in Wales.\nThe ability to raise the precept by more - how much is not yet clear - could allow those constabularies that rely on it most heavily, such as Surrey and Dorset, to generate substantial extra income.\nThat the government decided to perform an about-turn on police spending owes much to effective lobbying by police leaders who warned further cuts put the police in risky territory.\nA number of senior officers and PCCs made representations to the home secretary over the past few months. They were not shroud-wavers - but people whose views she respected.\nThey pointed to the growing signs of strain on police forces and their ability to deal with cyber-fraud and sexual offences, reports of which have gone up by 88% since 2012.\nThe attacks in Paris then cemented the view in Whitehall the cuts could not go ahead as planned.\nIf the chancellor had limited the cuts to 10%, which police said they could just about cope with, there would have been relief among most chiefs and PCCs.\nHis decision to go even further, no cuts at all, which took the opposition benches by complete surprise, suggests in the end politics played a key part too.\nPresented by Chancellor George Osborne, the Spending Review sets out what government spending will be over the next four years, while the Autumn Statement is an annual update of government plans for the economy.\nExplained: Which government departments will be affected?\nAnalysis: From BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\nSpecial report: Full in-depth coverage of the Spending Review and Autumn Statement","summary":"Finding savings and fending off cuts has dominated the policing debate in England and Wales for more than five years."}

The petition has attracted 109,285 signatures.\nThe scheduled hearing of the Commons Liaison Committee, the super committee of select committee chairs with the prime minister, has been cancelled because of the election. They now aim to hold a hearing as soon as possible in the new parliament, but since the new set of chairs are unlikely to be in place before mid-July, that may not be before the summer recess.\nIn the Lords, business opens (2.30pm) with tributes to Sir David Beamish who has stood down as the top official of the House, the Clerk of the Parliaments (the Clerk of the Commons is \"under-clerk\") to be led by the Leader of the House, Baroness Evans.\nAnd then peers move on to a series of orders and regulations, including the Trade Union (Deduction of Union Subscriptions from Wages in the Public Sector) Regulations 2017, the Immigration Act 2016 (Consequential Amendments) (Biometrics and Legal Aid) Regulations 2017, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2017 among others.\nThen there is a short debate on the report 'Race in the workplace: The McGregor-Smith Review' - which calls for all employers with more than 50 people to set aspirational targets to increase diversity and inclusion throughout their organisations - not just at the bottom. Companies should look at the make-up of the area in which they are recruiting to establish the right target. For instance, the proportion of working age people from a BME background in London and Birmingham is already over 40%, with Manchester not far behind. Baroness McGregor-Smith chairs the Women's Business Council, a working group that seeks to maximise women's contribution to economic growth, and was appointed by the then Business Secretary Sajid Javid, to lead a review of the issues faced by businesses in developing black and minority ethnic talent from when they start work through to the executive level.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am for Justice questions (watch out for fallout from the demise of the Prisons and Courts Bill, which has had to be scrapped because there is not enough time to get it through before the election) to be followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour's Rachel Reeves.\nThis is on fees and charges to unauthorised overdrafts, which are often higher than those for the now capped payday loans - an issue she has pursued on the Treasury Select Committee. She wants the Financial Conduct Authority to introduce a cap on the charges to bring them into line with the cap on payday loans.\nThe day's main event is the committee of the whole House debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill - which puts the measures announced in the Budget into effect - although the time pressure imposed by the election will probably mean controversial sections are stripped out. MPs will also debate Lords amendments to the Health Service Medical Supplies (Costs) Bill.\nIn Westminster Hall, there's a Backbench Business Committee debate on Post Office closures (9.30am- 11am), followed by a series of debates led by individual MPs: the Conservative former education secretary Nicky Morgan raises Police and local authority guidance on dogs attacking other dogs (11am- 1.30 am);  the Conservative Derek Thomas has a debate on employment opportunities in food and farming (2.30pm- 4pm); the Conservative James Heappey discusses Wells' bid for UK City of Culture (4pm-4.30pm) and the Conservative David Mackintosh leads a debate on grandparents' rights to access to grandchildren (4.30pm -5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) peers bash their way through Commons amendments to the Technical and Further Education Bill, the Neighbourhood Planning Bill (there is now all-party consensus around an amendment to provide protection for pubs in the planning system), and the Bus Services Bill.\nThen comes the main event: the report stage and third reading of the Criminal Finances Bill - watch out for the cross party amendment in the names of the Crossbencher Baroness Stern, Labour's Lord Rosser, the Lib Dem Baroness Kramer and the Conservative Lord Kirkhope, to require a register of the beneficial ownership of companies based in UK overseas territories like Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands - which they argue will improve transparency and help clamp down on money laundering.\nFinally, there is  a short debate on support for the steel industry and its role in the government's industrial strategy led by Lord Mendelsohn.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Welsh questions, followed at noon by  Prime Minister's questions - which, unless face to face TV debates are held, will be the only direct confrontation between Theresa May and her rivals before polling day.\nThen comes a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the SNP's Alan Brown, who wants to end the use of cash retentions in the construction industry. This is where a proportion of a sub contract is held over by the main contractor to sort any defects on the job - but sub-contractors routinely fail to get their money back in a timely manner or sometimes not at all, sometimes because of the insolvency of main contractor. Mr Brown is proposing a scheme similar to the tenancy deposit scheme which will provide independent protection.\nAfter that it's back to the washup, and consideration of Lords amendments to the Digital Economy Bill (issues in play include more superfast broadband, a proposed independent commission to set the BBC Licence Fee, a requirement that public service broadcasters are prominent on the channel displays of digital TV systems, and much much more), followed by Lords amendments to the Criminal Finances Bill (see above).\nThe adjournment led by Labour's Chris Evans is on the effect of diesel fumes in Islwyn - his constituency.\nIn Westminster Hall  there are debates on school funding in the North East of England, led by Labour's Sharon Hodgson (9.30am -11am);  the Colne to Skipton railway led by the Conservative Andrew Stephenson (11am - 11.30am) and learning outside the classroom, led by Labour's Barry Sheerman (4pm- 4.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) questions include the Green peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb on refining the definition of domestic extremism to enable the police to focus on those involved in terrorism and serious crime - she used the Data Protection Act to access her police file, and found she was considered a potential extremist, and had been under surveillance by the police's \"domestic extremism\" unit from 2001 until 2012, including during her candidacy to become London's mayor.\nShe is still pressing for answers about the surveillance and the alleged destruction of documents on her case.\nThen peers zoom through the remaining private members' bills sent over by the Commons - starting with the committee stage of the Local Audit (Public Access to Documents) Bill, followed by the Merchant Shipping (Homosexual Conduct) Bill and the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Bill - and the Farriers (Registration) Bill. All will have their third reading debates the next day.\nIn the Commons, MPs open (9.30am) with Exiting the European Union questions, followed by any remaining loose legislative ends sent over by their lordships. There may or may not be any.\nAnd the final debate of the 2015 Parliament will be the SNP MP Chris Stephens' adjournment on the cost of telephone calls to the Department for Work and Pensions.\nIn the Lords (from 11am) questions to ministers include the Conservative, Baroness Couttie, the Leader of Westminster City Council, calling for legislation to regulate pedicab drivers. Then peers will move on to those third reading debates - on the Local Audit (Public Access to Documents) Bill, the Merchant Shipping (Homosexual Conduct) Bill, the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Bill and the Farriers (Registration) Bill.\nAnd their final task will be to approve some statutory instruments on Driving Disqualifications and Student Fees, Awards and Support- although that last one comes with a regret motion attached, from Labour's Lord Clark of Windermere. So it is possible that the final act of the House of Lords in this Parliament might be to defeat the government.\nAnd when all is done, the mildly pythonesque ceremony of prorogation will follow, with much doffing of cocked hats and flowery cod-medieval language.\nSome MPs, mostly those who're not seeking re-election, usually come to the bar of the House to watch the spectacle.\nAnd that will be it until Parliament reconvenes after the election, On 3 May (following dissolution at 00:01 BST that morning) a meeting of the Privy Council will issue a proclamation to declare the meeting of the new Parliament with 14 June the likely date.\nThe only business at the meeting will be to elect a Speaker. The next day the anointed Speaker will receive the Royal Approbation, and this will allow MPs and peers start to swear the Oath of Allegiance. This continues until Friday. New MPs then have the chance to go on various induction courses and are allocated offices.\nMy bet is that 21 June  will see the state opening, with the government's plans for the coming session announced.","summary":"It's the last rites of the 2015 Parliament - and in a frenzy of last minute deal-making, the legislation which can be completed will be rushed to the finishing line, while all manner of bills and other parliamentary business is dropped for lack of time."}

It will reach full capacity some time next month.\nPrime Minister Abe said on Monday that the reactors had passed \"the world's toughest safety screening\".\n\"I would like Kyushu Electric to put safety first and take utmost precautions for the restart,\" he said.\nSince shutting down all nuclear plants, Japan has been relying on imported fossil fuels for its energy, at huge expense. The government has said nuclear power must resume to cut both import bills and growing CO2 emissions.\nExperts have also warned that reactors left idle for years tend to experience teething problems and that such a mass restart of dormant reactors has never been attempted before, says our correspondent.\nJapan's Nuclear Regulation Authority approved two reactors at the Sendai plant last September under stricter safety rules. The second reactor is due to be restarted in October.\nMore than $100m (\u00c2\u00a364m) has been spent on fitting new safety systems at the Sendai plant.\nBut local residents say the new safety regulations are not stringent enough - they are worried about potential dangers from active volcanoes in the region.\nProtesters were rallied by Naoto Kan, prime minister at the time of the Fukushima crisis, who told the crowd: \"We don't need nuclear plants.\"\nHe said the Fukushima disaster had \"exposed the myth of safe and cheap nuclear power, which turned out to be dangerous and expensive\".\nOne of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded struck off the coast of Japan in March 2011, triggering a huge tsunami which damaged the Fukushima nuclear plant, leading to meltdown.\nAlmost 16,000 people died and more than 2,500 are still listed as missing, though none of the deaths has been linked to the nuclear disaster.\nSome 160,000 people were evacuated from the surrounding areas in the following weeks - continuing high radiation levels mean most have never been able to return home.","summary":"Japan has restarted its first nuclear reactor under new safety rules following the 2011 Fukushima disaster."}

It admits it has not had the time or money to vet all of them properly.\nUKIP says it has evidence that smears about its candidates are being spread by Conservative Central Office, which it claims has been trawling would-be UKIP councillors' Twitter and Facebook pages for months.\n\"Were we inclined to return the favour, we would find even more examples to use against them.\n\"We deem that using our candidates as cannon fodder to undermine a political campaign (is) morally reprehensible and downright dirty,\" said a spokesman.\nThe party is investigating six candidates over links to the BNP and other far right groups or alleged racist and homophobic comments, following stories in national and local newspapers.\n\"I am glad they have found some candidates in the BNP because we don't want them. We are quite pleased. We don't want these people in the party,\" a UKIP spokesman said.\nHe said the row showed the Conservative Party was \"rattled\" by UKIP, which is hoping to make significant gains in Tory heartlands on Thursday, but added: \"This isn't scrutiny, it's smear.\"\nAsked on the BBC's Andrew Marr show about UKIP's claims, Transport Secretary Patrick McLaughlin said all candidates had to be scrutinised, but added: \"I don't know anything about a smear campaign.\"\nBut his cabinet colleague, Ken Clarke, minister without portfolio, added fuel to the row in an interview with Sky News.\nHe said: \"They of course have not been able to vet their candidates. Fringe right parties do tend to collect a number of waifs and strays...\n\"Some of them are saying quite different things now they are in politics than their actual views.\"\nAsked whether he agreed with David Cameron's 2006 claim that UKIP was made up of \"fruitcakes and closet racists\", Mr Clarke replied: \"I have met people who satisfy both those descriptions in UKIP.\n\"Indeed, some of the people who have assured me they are going to vote UKIP I would put in that category. I rather suspect they have never voted for me.\"\nMr Clarke said he was sure that \"most of the UKIP people are perfectly nice when they are having a drink\".\nBut he added: \"The trouble with UKIP really is it is just a protest party.\n\"It is against the political class, it is against foreigners, it is against immigrants. But it does not have any very positive policies. They do not know what they are for.\"\nHe added: \"The temptation to ordinary voters to UKIP is these are very difficult times, the political classes are regarded as having got us into a mess.\n\"It is very tempting to vote for a collection of clowns or indignant, angry people, who promise that somehow they will allow us to take your revenge on people who caused it.\"\nConservative backbencher Nadine Dorries criticised Mr Clarke's intervention, saying in a Twitter message: \"I suppose Ken Clarke's strategy of being rude to and insulting Tories about to vote UKIP means we don't want them back for general election?\"\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage echoed Ms Dorries' comments, saying: \"It is obvious that Mr Clarke holds millions of people in this country in utter contempt.\n\"UKIP are attracting supporters from all three main parties and, significantly those who have either not voted for over 10 years or have never voted before in their lives.\n\"Instead of slagging them off maybe he should try to wrap his head around the idea that UKIP are appealing to people due to the failure of the bloated self-satisfied political machine of which he is such a typical member.\n\"He obviously doesn't care and isn't at all interested in attracting those millions to vote for the Conservatives, well so be it.

{"id":"32166352","document":"Dead Sheep focuses on the events leading up to Howe's infamous 1990 resignation speech, in which he savaged his long-time boss and one-time political soulmate Margaret Thatcher.\nThat speech - one of the first to be shown on television live from the House of Commons - was the beginning of Thatcher's downfall as prime minister.\nIt was all the more remarkable because no one thought Howe had it in him to be Thatcher's political assassin. Least of all Thatcher herself.\nHowe had been at her side as her chancellor, foreign secretary and deputy prime minister since the very beginning of her reign in Downing Street.\nBut he was often viewed as an ineffectual yes-man, and was someone she increasingly treated with impatience and disdain, in front of cabinet colleagues.\nThe play's title comes from one of the most widely-quoted political put-downs of all time, when Labour's Dennis Healey described being attacked by Howe as like being \"savaged by a dead sheep\".\nHowe's frustration at Thatcher's increasingly strident anti-EU stance at a time when he was trying to negotiate Britain's membership of the European Exchange Rate mechanism, and his demotion to the \"non-job\" of deputy prime minister, was the trigger for his resignation.\nHis resignation speech, given two weeks after he quit the cabinet, stunned the Commons into silence, as he compared himself to a cricketer who had been sent out to the crease, only to discover his bat had been smashed by the team's captain.\nBut in an era packed with larger-than-life Conservative politicians such as Michael Heseltine, Alan Clark and Thatcher herself, the famously uncharismatic Howe is still not the obvious choice to place centre stage.\n\"I just admire him so much because he really, really meant it. In all these films and plays I've seen he gets treated like a shifty-eyed buffoon and I was thinking 'No!,'\" playwright Jonathan Maitland told BBC News after the play's opening night.\n\"I've read his book umpteen times. He agonised over it and he really, really cared.\n\"And it was a very difficult thing for him to do and he stood up and did the right thing for his country and his party and I just think that's incredibly heroic. He's just a hero. He's a political hero.\"\nMaitland is hoping Dead Sheep will strike a chord with fellow Howe fans.\n\"A lot of people have nursed a secret admiration for him, because he's like Captain Mainwaring meets William Gladstone.\"\nThe play focuses on Howe's relationship with the two formidable women in his life - Margaret Thatcher and his wife Elspeth. Maitland describes him as a \"panda between two lionesses\".\n\"It's a personal drama. It's a love story. Two types of marriage - Geoffrey's and Elspeth's, and Geoffrey's and Margaret's. One's a traditional marriage, one's a political marriage.\"\nHe admits to using a bit of dramatic licence when it comes to portraying Howe's wife, played by Jill Baker, in the Lady Macbeth mould - a key scene sees Elspeth, encouraging a hesitant Howe, played by James Wilby, to go for the jugular in his resignation speech.\n\"The truth is she saw the speech the night before and she said 'are you sure you want to go that far?'\n\"That's not very dramatic, so in the play, he's written a stinker, he feels bad about it, she turns him round and inspires him to write a better one.\"\nElspeth did inspire the speech, insists Maitland, \"not quite the way it appears in the play but I don't think anyone will accuse us of being dishonest.\"\nHe admits it was a risk casting a man, Steve Nallon, as Thatcher. Nallon, who voiced Thatcher on Spitting Image, gives a pitch perfect reproduction of Thatcher's voice and mannerisms.\n\"He gives it a kind of comic energy which it otherwise wouldn't have, if an ordinary actress was playing Thatcher,\" says Maitland.\n\"He gives an incredible performance and it's a risk I'd take every day of the year.\"\nMaitland believes the play has a lot of contemporary relevance, particularly with the ongoing debate about Britain's relationship with Europe, but above all, he says:  \"I wanted it to be a love letter to old style politics, where being rubbish on TV didn't matter.\n\"And I think it tells us that's OK to stick to your guns and do something that's really unpopular and to fall on your sword.

He was later released without charge.\nBut the stain of association with Japan's war crimes in China never completely went away.\nSecondly, Mr Abe's support base comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party.\nAccording to Professor Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo, Mr Abe is \"showing he is a tough guy\", that he is not afraid of China. It is something that plays very well to his base.\nBut there is perhaps a bigger goal that Mr Abe has in mind.\nHe wants to radically revise Japan's post-war constitution.\nThis, too, is a long-held dream that started with his grandfather in the 1950s.\nMr Abe believes he is the man to complete the historic task of getting rid of the hated \"peace constitution\".\nLike many on the right here, Mr Abe believes that constitution was forced on Japan by America and is a humiliation.\nIt imposes not only pacifism, but also Western notions of human rights and civil liberties. It rejects Japan's uniqueness in favour of \"universal values\".\nMr Abe would like to change a lot of this. But it will be very hard. And so he will need some help.\n\"Abe has provoked China, and China has reacted just as Abe wanted it to,\" says Prof Kingston. \"There is a shrewd political calculus at work here.\"\nWhat he means is that having an external threat in the shape of big and frightening China may be just what Mr Abe wants to help push through his controversial nationalist agenda at home.","summary":"Whatever Shinzo Abe says, any visit to the Yasakuni shrine by a Japanese prime minister is deeply political and sure to cause offence."}

There is also a very wide difference in calories burnt between one person and another.\nFor example, 10,000 steps could equate to anything from 400 kilocalories to 800 kilocalories lost, depending on a person's height and weight alone, the study said.\nDr David Ellis, lecturer in computation social science at Lancaster University, said working out the number of calories burnt was a tricky business and relied on many different factors such as height, weight, percentage of body fat, heart rate and more.\n\"However, because manufactures do not share the algorithms [which are constantly updated] used to determine calories burned, it is almost impossible to know the exact source of error at this stage,\" he said.\nFitness trackers can have a very positive effect on people's activity levels, so complete 100% accuracy may not be vital if the devices are encouraging more exercise.\nBut recent trials have suggested that wearing them doesn't always result in a positive outcome, or improve the chances of losing weight.\nThe researchers urged companies to be more transparent and publish the results of their own accuracy tests.\nThey said this would ensure the public and clinicians were aware of the devices' limitations.\nThe Stanford team has set up their own website to share this kind of data with others.","summary":"Most fitness trackers are good at measuring heart rate but poor at measuring calories burned, a study suggests."}

{"id":"36092074","document":"In mathematical terms it means that he has ridden more winners than any other jockey this season. In the context of horse racing, and sport in general, it is a triumph of commitment and perseverance which may never be rivalled.\nJohnson has been trying to win it since the 1990s. It is his curse, and his blessing, that his career coincided with Sir Anthony (AP) McCoy. For 20 years in succession McCoy was champion. Throughout that time, almost every year, the man who finished behind him in second place was Richard Johnson.\nI met up with Richard Johnson in Somerset at the yard of trainer Philip Hobbs - their relationship has been an important part of the jockey's career.\nAt 7.30 on an April morning Johnson was helping to school a group of the yard's horses, taking them over hurdles and fences on a field high above the Bristol Channel. In racing this might be termed 'work' but for Johnson, even at 38 years of age, he insists it is still pleasure.\n\"This is all I've ever wanted to do so it's not a job. Unfortunately I'm going to have to get a job one day when I have to stop doing it, but genuinely you love doing it. I think the 'job' is the driving round, the long days, but riding the horses is the fun bit,\" he said.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"But for me being champion jockey was the thing I've always wanted to do since I was a child growing up. So I suppose actually to reach that goal is always what I wanted to do and there's a lot of satisfaction.\n\"When AP McCoy retired at the end of last year I sort of thought, well I should be able to have a good chance at it. But there was a pressure. If I don't become champion jockey now maybe I'll not achieve what I wanted to. But the season's been absolutely amazing. My agent Dave Roberts works tirelessly to keep me busy and sends me round the country on a daily basis to hopefully achieve what I have.\"\nRoberts was McCoy's agent too and in simple terms Johnson has picked up rides this year which may have previously gone to McCoy. It's helped him dominate the Jockeys' Championship.\nIn the history of jump racing McCoy is the only man to have ridden more than 4,000 winners. But only one other jockey has gone past 3,000 winners, and that's Johnson.\nWhen McCoy was riding in his first championship winning season in 1995, Johnson was in his first year as a conditional, or apprentice, jockey. For two decades they were in each other's company on almost a daily basis. The relationship was simultaneously bitter rivalry and deep appreciation.\nJohnson said: \"I used to tell him regularly, you'd get to Christmas, I'd say to AP, 'just go on holiday for a couple of months, give me a bit more of a chance!' With our sport you can win the Gold Cup or the Grand National one day and unfortunately half an hour later you can be sat on your bum nursing an injury. You never know what's going to happen.\n\"We work with each other on a daily basis so after the race you're concerned that everyone came back in one piece and you can all have another go in half an hours' time.\"\n\"I'm sure in my twenties I got very frustrated with AP, I felt however hard I tried or however great a week I had he'd always have a better one. I'm sure I got frustrated, not really with him but just that it didn't seem to matter how hard I tried. I didn't seem to be able to bridge the gap.\n\"But as you get older you become a little more realistic and you know you've just got to give 100% and hopefully you'll get your chance. This year it's a shame AP isn't still riding because it would be great to beat him but it doesn't take the shine off it for me, for me this is always what I've wanted to do.\"\nThere is a new trophy for this year's champion jockey. The trophy was fashioned by Asprey's jewellers but the design was selected by McCoy. Furthermore, the man who placed it in Johnson's hands was none other than McCoy himself.\n\"I couldn't be happier about who I'm presenting it to,\" said the retired champion.\n\"He is someone who made me achieve what I achieved for so long and I think it's thoroughly deserved for his great work and his hard work and dedication for the last 20 odd years. I think it shows perseverance can always come good in the end.\"\nThe experience of competing for so long against McCoy has shaped Johnson's approach to the sport. He feels the presence of his great rival even though he's retired.\n\"We were both probably greedy and wanted as many winners as each other and I think we probably pushed each other to do the best we could,\" added Johnson.\n\"I think even though he's retired, in my mind I'm still convinced I've got to give it everything every day of the week to make sure you get what you're looking for.\"\nEven though jump racing is split into seasons it is basically never-ending. The new campaign starts the week after the old one ends and there's the Punchestown Festival in Ireland between.\nJohnson anticipates a grand total of two days off. But there is, he claims, no prospect of his enthusiasm wavering. Just the opposite in fact.\n\"I'm lucky in the fact that I'm probably a little bit smaller than AP was, I don't struggle quite as much with my weight so that's definitely a bonus for me and I'm a few years younger. I'm loving doing what I'm doing,\" he said.\n\"This is where I've always wanted to be so I'm not going to suddenly decide to give up now. The support I've had obviously off Philip Hobbs and his owners has been fantastic.

This was my mission,\" she says.\nFast forward seven years, and Ms Dhingra, now 28, is the owner of three busy macaron shops in Mumbai. Another three stores will open in the city this year, and she has plans to expand her business, Le 15 Patisserie, across the country.\nYet as a young businesswoman in India, she says it hasn't always been plain sailing.\nMs Dhingra should have been a lawyer. But while studying law at university in Mumbai, she decided that she wanted to quit to do something more creative.\nRemembering helping her mother in the kitchen during her childhood, she decided to work with food instead of legal cases.\nSo she convinced her parents to let her go to Switzerland to study hospitality and management.\nAfter three years at a Swiss catering college, Ms Dhingra did one year at the well-known Le Cordon Bleu school in Paris.\nReturning to Mumbai upon graduation, she set to work in her parents' kitchen on developing her own macaron recipe.\nYet with the weather in Mumbai being substantially hotter and more humid than Paris, she struggled for half a year, as the heat and humidity makes it difficult to make the delicate cakes.\n\"When I started making macarons, first at my home kitchen, it was a complete disaster,\" she says.\n\"It took me around six months of research and 60 failed recipes to finally get something right.\"\nWhen she finally had a recipe she was proud of, her businessman father agreed to invest the initial funds she required to set up the business.\nYet being both young and female meant she faced additional challenges.\n\"The biggest problem was to get people to take you seriously,\" she says. \"For example, if I had to sign a lease for a place, or buy machinery, I would have to ask my father to make these calls for me.\"\nMs Dhingra also found it difficult to deal with Indian red tape.\n\"My education in Switzerland, and working in hotels there, gave me a good idea of what working in hospitality would be like, but dealing with the bureaucracy is extremely difficult when starting a business in India.\"\nThe Boss is a series profiling entrepreneurs from around the world.\nHowever, she eventually secured the premises for a small commercial kitchen in 2010, and began hiring and training staff. The first shop soon followed.\nShe named the business Le 15 Patisserie after the 15th arrondissement or area of Paris, where she lived during her time in the French capital.\nTo start to build up sales in a city where very few people knew what a macaron was, let alone have tried one, Ms Dhingra concentrated on giving away free samples.\nThe cakes were immediately popular, and sales soon took off thanks to positive word of mouth.\nMs Dhingra also started running classes on how to make macarons and other cakes, which gave the business a further promotional boost.\nShe has also since released a cookery book, which has been a best-seller in India.\nOne newspaper article called her \"the macaron queen of India\".\nAs she plans the expansion of her business, Ms Dhingra is keen to stress that she has had no additional money from her parents since her father's initial investment.\nThe world is getting wealthier - but with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, who are the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015?\nA Richer World 2015\nListen to the reports and documentaries\nInstead, she says she has grown the business by reinvesting profits, and taking out bank loans. The shops now sell both macarons and other types of cakes, and the business employs 40 people in total.\nAfter seeing her success, a number of other people have now set up rival macaron shops in Mumbai, but Ms Dhingra says she doesn't mind the competition.\n\"People can only copy what you have done, no-one can copy your ideas and vision. So I like it [the competition], it keeps me on my feet, and we always push our boundaries so that we can always stay a step ahead.\"\nShe urges other young women, both in India and overseas, to also start their own companies.\n\"Once you are passionate about what you want to do you will achieve it,\" she says. \"The hours will be long and challenges will appear, but if you are passionate enough you will succeed.\"","summary":"When Pooja Dhingra tasted her first macaron she immediately knew what she wanted to do with her life."}

The 80bn euro-a-month quantitative easing scheme had been due to end in March, but was expected to be extended.\nThe stimulus programme was an effort to increase the supply of money in the economic bloc to keep interest rates low, and encourage borrowing and spending.\nThe European Central Bank's key job is to maintain \"price stability\" in the Eurozone, which it interprets as inflation of below but close to 2%.\nFor the last few years it has been wrestling with inflation that its governing council considers too low, at times even below zero - a situation of deflation or falling prices.\nThat has led the bank to choose very unusual policies intended to stimulate prices rises - ultra-low interest rates (one of its rates is negative) and quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly created money.\nSo with inflation now at 1.8%, pretty much in line with the target, is that job done? Time to turn the policy taps off?\nNot necessarily. The rise in inflation is down to higher food and especially energy prices. The impact of those factors is likely to fade and other price rises are still relatively slow.\nThere are different views in the ECB's governing council but the majority are not likely to be in a hurry to get policy back to normal.\nThe eurozone's unemployment rate of 9.6% in December was down from 9.7% in November and  compares with a rate of 10.5% a year earlier.\nThe countries with the lowest unemployment rates in December were the Czech Republic (3.5%) and Germany (3.9%), while countries with the highest levels of unemployment were Greece (23.0% in October 2016) and Spain (18.4%).\nDespite the pick-up in economic growth during the final quarter of 2016, across the year as a whole eurozone GDP rose by 1.7%, which was down from 2% in 2015.\nAnalysts also questioned whether the recent improvement could be sustained.\n\"While recent economic news points to improved growth, we suspect the eurozone may find it difficult to sustain this momentum amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight.\n\"Consequently, we suspect that eurozone GDP growth in 2017 will be no more than 1.6%. We also see growth at 1.6% in 2018.\"","summary":"The eurozone's economy is showing signs of recovery after the latest data pointed to a fall in unemployment while growth and inflation picked up."}

He told a press conference it could take a year to come up with a new plan, and that Switzerland risked losing foreign investment as a result.\nCurrently Switzerland grants special status to foreign firms which allows cantons, or districts, to offer them lower rates of tax than domestic firms, making Switzerland an attractive destination for foreign investors.\nBut international organisations such as the OECD have deemed the system unacceptable and Switzerland has made a commitment to reform it by 2019.\nTo avoid raising taxes for multinational companies too sharply the government had agreed to abolish the special status for multinationals but instead offer new tax breaks for research and development and other activities.\nAs part of the proposal, Switzerland's cantons planned to lower their tax rates for businesses across the board, including domestic business, helping to avoid steep rises in tax bills when foreign firms' status was brought into line.\nSome of the resulting budget shortfall in the cantons would have been plugged by federal funds.\nBut the plan was opposed by Social Democrats, Greens, trade unions and churches who argued that the reduced tax revenue would still lead to cuts in public services or higher personal taxes.\n\"The conservative parties wanted to push through tax reform with arrogance and haughtiness against the interests of the people.

{"id":"39519844","document":"How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why.\nIt used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier.\nThis is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows.\nThen we had the financial crisis of 2008.\nThe upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them.\nFor example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of \u00a327,000 at the age of 28, compared with \u00a328,000 for those born in the 1970s.\nThe figure was \u00a321,000 for those born in the 1960s and \u00a315,000 for those born in the 1950s.\nDespite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age.\nBy their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about \u00a327,000 each, on average.\nBy the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - \u00a353,000 each.\nA large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither.\nAt the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s.\nHome ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30.\nSimilarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago.\nThe lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices.\nIn their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs.\nAt the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing.\nFor today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage.\nLower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income.\nOf course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices.\nThe vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues.\nThis is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire.\nThe schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous.\nIn their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme.\nThis compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s.\nIn 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes.\nWith stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially.\nBut those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future.\nOf those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance.\nOur data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued.\nWithin each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off.\nAmong the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%.\nData is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s.\nSo, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations.\nBut most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation.\nIt looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.\nAbout this piece\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\nAndrew Hood is a senior research economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), specialising in income, work and welfare.\nThe IFS describes itself as an independent research institute which aims to inform public debate on economics.

We've all got a bit of egg on our face.\"\nBookmakers have been cheering Leicester's success, whilst simultaneously putting their hands in their collective pockets.\nWilliam Hill has paid out more than \u00a320,000 to 39-year-old carpenter, Leigh Herbert.\nHe was one of the canny few to take up the now-famous odds of 5,000-1 for his team to win.\nAlthough he has been a supporter since he was 10,  he doesn't usually put his money where his heart is.\nBut, mulling over their prospects on a camping holiday he found he was encouraged by the team's performance at the end of last season, and, taking a shine to the appointment of Claudio Ranieri as manager, he decided to put down the \u00a35 bet for his team to win.\n\"I thought, they're going to do something special this season,\" he says.\n\"I really enjoyed the first half of the season, the second half just got harder and harder.\n\"I would feel sick watching them play.\"\nEventually, he cashed out \u00a32 of his \u00a35 bet, making \u00a35,600, but left the \u00a33 remainder in place, which eventually won him \u00a315,000. A big party is in order this weekend - as well as house hunting with his new deposit.\nBookmakers, like Coral, estimate the industry as a whole will have paid out around \u00a320m over the title win. Coral themselves lost \u00a32m.\nBut bookmakers won't have lost out overall, admits Ladbrokes' Alex Donohue.\nAlthough Ladbrokes are losing \u00a33m on Leicester this week, throughout the season a lot of bets were placed on the favourites, such as Chelsea and Manchester City, which will have more than cushioned the blow.\n\"\u00a33m is a record net payout for a title winner, but we did well out of Leicester upsetting the odds to get there. No complaints at all,\" he tweeted.\nLadbrokes are \"by no means crying out in pain\" over the season in general, says Mr Donohue.\nBookmakers do best when a second or third favourite team wins the title, he says.\nTitle win an amazing feeling - Ranieri\nLeicester 'can make \u00a3150m from PL title'\nThe greatest sporting story of all time?\nThe wearable tech giving sports teams winning ways\nMore importantly for bookmakers Leicester's win is a great story.\nThe bookmakers were much slower than the punters to believe that Leicester could win the title. The problem was not so much the long odds at the start of the season, but the fact that they were so slow to respond to Leicester's success.\nAt Christmas, when the Foxes were unbeaten for 10 games in a row, the odds were still quite high, in Coral's case they were still at 33-1 in December.\nIt wasn't until Leicester beat Manchester City 3-1 in February that they became favourites to win.\n\"The bookies were just ignoring their form. The punters started to believe but not the bookies,\" said Mr Clare.\n\"We've never lost money like this - it's the biggest hit we've ever taken. In a way it's a beautiful wake up call. It's an amazing moment.\"\nAnd there's a sound reason they are not downcast at their losses.  Next year they're expecting a great flood of new bets as fans from Burnley to Bournemouth hope that their team will \"do a Leicester\".\nThe odds on a Watford or a West Brom win are slight of course. Leicester's success was  a \"perfect storm of the right manager, right players, few injuries, no playing in Europe and the big teams underperforming\" says Dale Tempest from online betting firm Skybet.\nSkybet, which sponsors the three divisions below the Premier League, has a particularly large base of Leicester supporters and is therefore one of the companies that stands to lose the most - in the region of \u00a35m.\nInterestingly, the bookmakers seem to think that the chances of Leicester being relegated are greater than them winning again.\nMr Tempest says that's because the stakes have been raised - there will be tempting offers for the top players, the big teams are looking to change managers and they'll have to play in Europe.\nSo has it made the industry more cautious?\nLadbrokes says no more 5,000-1 odds for the Premier League, Coral says it will be much more cautious.\nBut Skybet have got 5,000-1 odds for Burnley to win the Premier League, who have just won the Championship and will be promoted next season. Already, 888 people have placed their bets - meaning that if they win Skybet stand to lose \u00a37m.\nHowever, Mr Tempest says the company will be quicker to slash the odds should the team start performing, a sentiment echoed by all the companies.\nBut William Hill's Graham Sharpe says this is a numbers game. The chances of Leicester winning were that slim and they would probably do the same again - and the next 4,999 times they'll be right.\nHe likens it to the jockey Frankie Dettori riding the winning horse in all seven races at Ascot in 1996 - an unheard of feat. He remembers the stunned haze surrounding the bookies and their \u00a340m loss.\nBut he says, it was so unlikely, that they all agreed they'd probably do the same again.\n\"This time we hold our hands up and say well done. But Ranieri, don't do it again,\" he says.\nAnd as for Leigh Herbert - will he be doing it again?\n\"This is it for me. I mean... it's not going to happen again, so why carry on?\"\nI wonder if he will stick to that.","summary":"The betting industry is licking its financial wounds."}

{"id":"39512639","document":"Off the court, where she makes the bulk of her earnings, the question is - can she be as big a sponsor draw as she was before her enforced absence?\nThe 29-year-old will return to action on Wednesday, 26 April, in Stuttgart after being handed a wildcard.\nAlthough some fellow players have expressed misgivings, she has the support of the WTA tour, and her fans.\nAnd, with biggest commercial rival Serena Williams announcing she is pregnant and facing time away from the game, the Russian's return is certainly timely.\nIn the year from June 2015, Forbes estimates the five-time Grand Slam winner made $1.9m (\u00c2\u00a31.5m) in prize money from playing, but a whopping $20m from endorsements, a sum matched only by Williams.\nAnd it is this primary source of earnings that Sharapova will be looking to reinvigorate.\n\"During her time out there will have been some continued relationship with her sponsors,\" says Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford.\n\"But I am sure there will have been some sort of penalty clause in her sponsor contracts for incurring a suspension.\"\nFollowing Sharapova's admission in March 2016 that she had tested positive for a banned drug at that year's Australian Open, she was initially banned by the International Tennis Federation for two years, later reduced on appeal.\nBut unlike golfer Tiger Woods, who haemorrhaged sponsors very quickly after his extra-marital affairs came to light, Sharapova's backers waited to see how things played out.\n\"That was because they had invested so much money and effort into their deals,\" says Prof Chadwick.\n\"Also, to terminate deals could have been dangerous as she might come back successfully, and if you as a sponsor have decided to cancel her contract then the door has been left wide open for a rival.\"\nAs it was the sponsor reaction was mixed - Head and Evian were immediately supportive, Nike and Porsche put their relationships on hold but later came back on board, while Tag Heuer and Avon chose not to extend deals that had ended.\nGiven the large amounts of money and time invested - Nike's relationship with the player dates back to when she was 11 years old - it is not surprising the major brands wanted to think hard before reaching their decisions.\n\"In terms of brands and reputation, what all this has highlighted is that first of all Sharapova is a major brand in her own right,\" says Karen Earl, chairman of the European Sponsorship Association.\n\"She commands a lot of media attention, as the furore about her comeback demonstrates. It also highlights that she is a huge star, and that women's tennis feels it needs her.\n\"That is one of the reasons why brands want to continue to associate with her. Those that stuck with her value the association of her brand with their brands.\"\nMrs Earl says the fact that Sharapova immediately put her hand up and admitted the drugs breach helped mitigate the damage to her brand, and those of her partners.\n\"Sharapova admitted she had done a wrong thing.\n\"She has gone out of her way to recognise what she has done and has handled that situation in a credible way. She has been contrite and said it will not happen again,\" says Mrs Earl.\n\"The fact there hasn't been a public outcry against her return will have reassured brands to stick with her.\n\"If there had been protests from tennis fans, then that might have influenced her sponsors' decisions.\"\nProf Chadwick says Sharapova's management and advisers, those who look after her profile, grabbed hold of a difficult situation very quickly.\nHe believes the Russian is now pushing at an open door with regards to her return to the sport, with WTA boss Steve Simon quoted as saying: \"I believe that the game, the fans, the tour... everybody is going to welcome Maria back.\"\nEven before Serena Williams' pregnancy announcement, Prof Chadwick says that the sport was struggling to find an heir apparent at the top of the women's game.\n\"There is not a great deal of highest-quality talent following on behind,\" he says.\n\"Nobody seems to be able to string together a consistent run of results. Women's tennis needs all the help it can get in terms of heroes, big names, elite talent to attract fans to the sport.\n\"As a constellation of female tennis player brands, the sport has been somewhat diminished by Sharapova's absence.\"\nMrs Earl points out that while many players have not taken too kindly to Sharapova's return, for her sponsors the important thing is the welcome she will receive from her fans, who are potential purchasers of their products.\n\"The sponsors are not endorsing her because she has been the most successful player, it is because of what she brings off the court,\" she says.\n\"Her persona and brand are what is most important. She knows how to market herself. She is commercially astute.\n\"To her credit, even after her time away, she is still probably the most marketable female tennis player.\"","summary":"Maria Sharapova faces the biggest challenge of her tennis career - namely her return to the sport after a 15-month drugs ban -  and it is not just her continued sporting success that is in the spotlight."}

{"id":"12066494","document":"It puts new, lower limits on the size of each country's nuclear arsenal, and updates the verification mechanism.\nThere are limits on warheads and on launchers, which must be implemented within seven years of the treaty's entry into force.\nWarheads: Under the New Start treaty each side is allowed a maximum of 1,550 warheads. This is about 30% lower than the figure of 2,200 that each side was meant to reach by 2012 under the Start treaty (as revised in the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty).\nLaunchers: Each country is allowed, in total, no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear arms. Another 100 are allowed if they are not operationally deployed - for example, missiles removed from a sub undergoing a long-term overhaul.\nThe new limit on delivery systems is less than half the ceiling of 1,600 specified in the original Start treaty.\nNot as dramatic as they might appear. The rules for counting warheads contain a big loophole. While each warhead on a ballistic missile is counted as one warhead, a heavy bomber is counted as carrying \"one warhead\" even though it may carry (in the case of a US B-52) up to 20 of them.\nAccording to the Arms Control Association, a pro-disarmament pressure group, the US could theoretically meet the new limits by cutting just 100 warheads, while Russia would only need to cut 190.\nIn addition, the agreed ceilings refer to deployed warheads, not to warheads in storage. A warhead could, in theory, be put into storage, and then redeployed when needed.\nThe cuts in launchers are also, in practice, not all that challenging. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimates that Russia currently has 566 - well under the permitted ceiling of 700. It estimates that the US has 798, necessitating a cut of about 12%.\nSupporters of the deal say that while it does not make big cuts, it is a useful confidence-building measure, which could pave the way for further nuclear deals with Russia.\nThey say it also signals to the rest of the world that the US and Russia are not ignoring their commitment under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to progressively disarm.\nThe important difference, according to the Arms Control Association, is that each side will now be able to carry out on-site inspections to verify how many warheads a missile is carrying. Together with satellite imagery, this should give an accurate picture of the other country's nuclear strength. Some other forms of verification will cease.\nYes, it says that both sides can engage in \"limited\" missile defence. Russia has warned that it will withdraw from the treaty if a future US missile defence shield weakens its nuclear deterrent.\nThe US Senate ratified it on 22 December, after much delay, so now all it needs is Russia's final approval.

And a decade on from these events we are still no closer to finding out exactly what happened.\nThe government has settled similar claims from former Guantanamo Bay inmates at a cost of millions of pounds - but a planned judge-led inquiry into these issues was scrapped.\nThat judge, Sir Peter Gibson, said there needs to be further investigation into complicity in rendition and torture - and the task was handed to Parliamentarians on the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC).\nCritics believe the ISC isn't equipped to get the answers - an accusation the committee would deny - but that's another reason why the Belhaj case is so important.\nHowever, addressing the Court of Appeal, Mr Hermer, representing Mr Belhaj, said the court was \"constitutionally competent\" to deal with the case.\n\"This court is the only forum in which remedies could possibly be obtained for those acts and omissions of the UK executive and its officials.\n\"If it can't be heard before this court, it will not be heard anywhere else as the principle of state immunity means it is highly unlikely that proceedings could be brought against UK officials in any other jurisdiction,\" he said\nMr Hermer said the case had \"profound and far-reaching\" implications for the rule of law in a world in which counter-terrorism was being fought by international co-operation. The effect of the High Court decision was that the state was to be placed above the law, he said.\nThe contested hearing is expected to last three days.\nMr Belhaj is now the leader of Libyan Islamist party Al-Watan.","summary":"Lawyers for a man who says he was tortured after his rendition to Libya have said the Court of Appeal should overturn a block on him suing the UK."}

{"id":"34812397","document":"The Kurdish Peshmerga had held 20% of the town since December 2014, and although there had been daily fighting since then, the two sides had been at a stalemate.\nSince Thursday, though, the Kurdish forces - backed by US air strikes - have made important ground, cutting early on the Highway 47 which passes Sinjar, the main supply line between IS' self-styled capital of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in northern Iraq.\nCapturing Sinjar will not only secure the highway, but the road south of Sinjar, towards the IS-held town of Baaj, is also reported to be under control of the Peshmerga forces.\nThis is supposed to provide a buffer zone large enough to keep Sinjar safe in the near future.\nHowever, it is by no means preventing IS from using scores of small countryside roads south of Sinjar that are still available until the winter weather makes them unusable.\nThe next step has to be against the IS-held town of Tal Afar, and then Mosul.\nIf not, Sinjar will always face attacks from those points. Yet, if Sinjar is de facto Kurdish territory, Tal Afar and Mosul are not.\nProfile: Who are the Peshmerga?\nWho are the Yazidis?\nTal Afar is populated with Arabs and Turkmen: this means that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) will not have any strategic interest in liberating and holding an area to which it has no claim.\nThe same goes for Mosul and Baaj. While KRG President Massoud Barzani has repeatedly hinted that his government would contribute to the retaking of Mosul, recapturing an Arab city could be perceived as an act of Kurdish aggression against Arabs, raising tensions with the Baghdad government and potentially harming the Kurdish minority that has continued to live in Mosul since IS took it.\nTactically, the town of Baaj, situated on higher grounds than Sinjar, will remain a perfect spot to target Sinjar.\nSince the Peshmerga do not possess long-range missiles, how will they be able to create a strong enough buffer zone for the 3,000 Yazidis trapped on the mountain for more than a year to be able to safely return and live in their homes?\nMoreover, as the IS frontline has been dissolved in Sinjar, IS is likely to return to its next best tactic: sending armoured vehicles packed with explosives to Peshmerga positions.\nOnce again, the Peshmerga are underequipped to face this daily threat.\nThe impending attack on Sinjar was an open secret.\nTwo weeks ago, I witnessed long military convoys that were already on their way to retake the town, only to be derailed by a claim by Peshmerga rivals - Turkey's Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels based in northern Iraq that it had already been recaptured from IS.\nThe claim did not just halt Peshmerga operations: it gave ample time for IS fighters to prepare and tactically retreat from Sinjar, just as they did in Tikrit last spring, only to take Ramadi a few weeks later.\nThe PKK is not the only local force that might get in the way of the Peshmerga as they seek to sustain their war effort.\nLocal Arab populations fear that retributions might take place against them from the Yazidi militias that have been randomly formed since the occupation of Sinjar Mountain in August 2014.\nWhen the Mosul Dam and the Zummar areas were recaptured from IS in late 2014, Yazidi militias kidnapped Arab women, drove villagers away and looted properties. There have been reports of more revenge attacks this year.\nWhile KRG security forces have been trying to maintain civil peace in the area, those events have eroded social cohesion, which could sow the seeds of future ethnic conflicts.\nIraq: The minorities of Nineveh\nDr Victoria Fontan is also Director of the Center for Peace and Human Security at the American University of Kurdistan.

{"id":"27654454","document":"The prisoner swap came after secret talks between the US government and the Taliban, brokered by Qatar.\nBergdahl was serving with an Alaska-based infantry regiment in Paktika province near the Pakistani border and went missing on 30 June 2009, five months after being deployed to Afghanistan.\nThe circumstances of his capture remain murky, with speculation he may have walked away from his base out of disillusionment with the US campaign.  In March 2015, he was charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy.\nThe US believes he was across the frontier in Pakistan for most of his captivity, reportedly held by the Haqqani network, which operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and is allied to the Afghan Taliban.\nProfile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl\nThe circumstances of Sgt Bergdahl's capture in 2009 remain unclear, although a Pentagon investigation a year later concluded he left his post in Paktika Province without authorisation, according to a Pentagon official speaking to Associated Press news agency.\nSeveral commentators and soldiers have branded him a deserter and called for him to be punished.\nThe New York Times said on his disappearance in 2009 had noted he had left military areas before, during a training programme in California and an Afghan outpost, but returned each time.\nUS officials told the newspaper the report did not conclude whether Sgt Bergdahl had intended to permanently desert the military.\nThe US military's top-ranking officer, Gen Martin Dempsey, has that the Army would not ignore misconduct but that the 28-year-old was innocent until proven guilty. \"When he is able to provide the facts, we'll learn what happened.\"\nThe defence department opened up an investigation into his disappearance and capture, appointing a two-star general with combat experience in Afghanistan to lead the inquiry.\nTaliban officials say the 28-year-old was handed over near Khost, close to the the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the evening of 31 May. A several-dozen strong US special forces team flew in by helicopter and briefly met some 18 Taliban on the ground.\nThe exchange, captured on video, shows Sgt Bergdahl sitting in a pick-up truck before being walked to the helicopter.\nOnce the helicopter was in the air, Bergdahl wrote the letters \"SF?\" on a paper plate - an abbreviation for special forces - and reportedly broke down when the men responded: \"Yes, we've been looking for you for a long time.\"\nTaliban release video of handover\nSgt Bergdahl was the only US soldier being held by the enemy in the Afghan conflict, and Washington had long been seeking his release, spurred on by the \"Standing with Bowe\" campaign led by his parents in Hailey, Idaho.\nNegotiations for the US-Taliban prisoner swap began three years ago with US and Taliban officials meeting face-to-face in Qatar.\nBut the talks did not move forward because the US were pushing for a wider peace process, while the Taliban wanted to limit the talks to a prisoner swap, Taliban sources told the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul.\nDirect negotiations broke down a year ago when the Afghan government opposed the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar, although secret talks continued, mediated by Qatar.\nThe issue was given more impetus as plans solidified to pull nearly all American forces out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016. US sources say the breakthrough came when hardline Taliban leaders dropped their opposition to a swap.\nOn Thursday, Mr Obama said Sgt Bergdahl's health was deteriorating and officials were \"deeply concerned about it\".\nBut the prisoner swap was apparently sped up after US officials determined the Taliban would likely kill Sgt Bergdahl if any word of the deal was leaked, according to congressional and White House sources who spoke to the Associated Press.\nDefence Secretary Chuck Hagel told the BBC's Katty Kay he and other military chiefs based their decision \"on the information that we had, that his life, his health, were in peril\".\nHis father Robert Bergdahl said Bowe was struggling to speak English after his long captivity. In an emotional White House lawn press conference with Barack Obama shortly after the release, Robert Bergdahl delivered his son a message in Pashto, the language of his captors.\nAfter immediate medical attention at a military hospital in Germany,  Sgt Bergdahl was flown to San Antonio, Texas, to continue treatment.\nOn Friday, Army officials said he was in a \"stable condition\".\nHe \"looked good\", was in uniform, and saluted, Maj Gen Joseph DiSalvo said.\n\"He appeared just like any sergeant would when they see a two-star general - a little bit nervous,\" Gen DiSalvo said. \"But he looked good, saluted, and had good deportment.\"\nCan you lose your language?\nThe exchanged prisoners are Mohammad Fazl, Khirullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Noori and Mohammad Nabi Omari.\nThey are thought to be the most senior Afghans still held at Guantanamo, having been captured during America's military campaign in 2001.\nFazl served as the Taliban's deputy defence minister and is accused of possible war crimes, including the murder of thousands of Shia Muslims.\nKhairkhwa served as interior minister and governor of Herat, Afghanistan's third largest city. He is alleged to have had direct links to Osama bin Laden.\nUS President Barack Obama says Qatar has given assurances \"that it will put in place measures to protect our national security\".\nUnder the deal, the five freed Taliban detainees will be banned from leaving Qatar for at least a year, meaning they cannot return to Afghanistan until after a majority of US forces have left.\nThe Associated Press' Kathy Gannon, who was shot in Afghanistan while covering the recent elections, says the five men are important but not likely to change the balance of the war - and having been away from Afghanistan for more than a decade, they would not find Taliban foot soldiers very loyal.\nSome argue there is US precedent for this type of transfer, with Ronald Reagan's administration in 1985-86 reportedly winning the freedom of US hostages in Beirut in exchange for arms destined for Iran.\nBut Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called it a fundamental shift in policy that would act as an incentive for further abductions of US personnel.\nSome US lawmakers have complained the swap breaches a law that Congress should be given 30 days' notification before Guantanamo Bay detainees are released. The White House says it took the chance to free Sgt Bergdahl in \"unique and exigent circumstances\".\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, normally a White House ally, was enraged that the president had not notified her or the intelligence committee she leads, of the pending swap, although a White House official did call her on Monday to apologise for the delay.\nThe US has a long-standing policy not to negotiate with those it deems terrorists and the prisoner swap has drawn criticism - especially from conservatives.\nRepublican Senator John McCain told the BBC the swaps \"threatened\" US security, as the detainees released were too dangerous to be walking free, and would put other US military lives at risk. Other lawmakers have called for a inquiry into the administration and military's decision making process.\nBut Mr Obama is publically unapologetic for the swap.\n\"We saw an opportunity and we seized it,\" he said, adding \"as commander-in-chief I am responsible for those kids\".\nNo Obama apology for Bergdahl deal\nCorrespondents say it is unclear what impact the release will have on a wider peace process.\nThe Afghan High Peace Council want talks with the Taliban to happen inside Afghanistan, and does not want to involve the Americans.\nBowe Bergdahl returned to the US on 13 June 2014, arriving at a medical centre in Texas where he finished the last phase of his reintegration process.\nIn his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, a rally scheduled months ahead was quickly turned into a homecoming event that was cancelled.\nCity officials cited safety concerns, because of a large increase in the number of expected attendees, and local officials have received messages blasting the town for honouring Sgt Bergdahl's return.\nSgt Bergdahl returned to active duty in July, working at a desk job at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston.\nIn March 2015, he was charged with desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty and misbehaviour before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command unit or place.\nA preliminary hearing will be heard in front of a judge at Fort Sam Houston.

{"id":"40654915","document":"It is an astonishing mass of material that has essentially been created only in the last 65 years or so.\nThe 8.3 billion tonnes is as heavy as 25,000 Empire State Buildings in New York, or a billion elephants.\nThe great issue is that plastic items, like packaging, tend to be used for very short periods before being discarded.\nMore than 70% of the total production is now in waste streams, sent largely to landfill - although too much of it just litters the wider environment, including the oceans.\n\"We are rapidly heading towards 'Planet Plastic', and if we don't want to live on that kind of world then we may have to rethink how we use some materials, in particular plastic,\" Dr Roland Geyer told BBC News.\nA paper authored by the industrial ecologist from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and colleagues appears in the journal Science Advances. It is described as the first truly global assessment of how much plastic has been manufactured, how the material in all its forms is used, and where it ends up. Here are some of its key numbers.\nThere is no question that plastics are a wonder material. Their adaptability and durability have seen their production and use accelerate past most other manmade materials apart from steel, cement and brick.\nFrom the start of mass-manufacturing in the 1950s, the polymers are now all around us - incorporated into everything from food wrapping and clothing, to aeroplane parts and flame retardants. But it is precisely plastics' amazing qualities that now present a burgeoning problem.\nNone of the commonly used plastics are biodegradable. The only way to permanently dispose of their waste is to destructively heat it - through a decomposition process known as pyrolysis or through simple incineration; although the latter is complicated by health and emissions concerns.\nIn the meantime, the waste mounts up. There is enough plastic debris out there right now, Geyer and colleagues say, to cover an entire country the size of Argentina. The team's hope is that their new analysis will give added impetus to the conversation about how best to deal with the plastics issue.\n\"Our mantra is you can't manage what you don't measure,\" Dr Geyer said. \"So, our idea was to put the numbers out there without us telling the world what the world should be doing, but really just to start a real, concerted discussion.\"\nRecycling rates are increasing and novel chemistry has some biodegradable alternatives, but manufacturing new plastic is so cheap the virgin product is hard to dislodge.\nThe same team - which includes Jenna Jambeck from the University of Georgia and Kara Lavender Law from the Sea Education Association at Woods Hole - produced the seminal report in 2015 that quantified the total amount of plastic waste escaping to the oceans each year: eight million tonnes.\nThis particular waste flow is probably the one that has generated most concern of late because of the clear evidence now that some of this discarded material is getting into the food chain as fish and other marine creatures ingest small polymer fragments.\nDr Erik van Sebille from Utrecht University in the Netherlands is an oceanographer who tracks plastics in our seas. Of the new report, he said: \"We're facing a tsunami of plastic waste, and we need to deal with that.\n\"The global waste industry needs to get its act together and make sure that the ever-increasing amounts of plastic waste generated don't end up in the environment.\n\"We need a radical shift in how we deal with plastic waste. On current trends, it will take until 2060 before more plastic gets recycled than landfilled and lost to the environment. That clearly is too slow; we can't wait that long,\" he told BBC News.\nAnd Richard Thompson, professor of marine biology at Plymouth University, UK, commented: \"If plastic products are designed with recyclability in mind they can be recycled many times over. Some would say a bottle could be recycled 20 times. That's a substantial reduction in waste. At the moment poor design limits us.\"\nTo illustrate that point, Dr Geyer said: \"The holy grail of recycling is to keep material in use and in the loop for ever if you can. But it turns out in our study that actually 90% of that material that did get recycled - which I think we calculated was 600 million tonnes - only got recycled once.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos","summary":"US scientists have calculated the total amount of plastic ever made and put the number at 8.3 billion tonnes."}

{"id":"34729150","document":"This is on a par with US President Barack Obama meeting with Cuba's Raul Castro except, unlike Washington and Havana, the two sides still haven't normalised relations. In fact they haven't even signed a peace treaty and in 66 years they have taken very different paths.\nNo agreements will be signed, no joint statements made, but China's Xi Jinping and Taiwan's Ma Ying-jeou will have an hour-long meeting and a casual dinner afterwards. It could get awkward and here are some of the questions that could crop up.\nChina has hundreds of missiles targeted at Taiwan to warn the island against declaring formal independence. Beijing still considers Taiwan a province to be reunified with the mainland one day and has not renounced the use of force to take it back. In fact, one of the main reasons for its military build-up is to counter possible US assistance to Taiwan if Beijing were to try to take back militarily.\nMr. Ma would argue: \"If you want to be friends, you must remove these missiles.\"\n\"Not that simple,\" Mr Xi might answer. Doing so could embolden pro-independence groups in Taiwan who want the island to be recognised as a completely separate country from China.\nThe meeting will take place less than three months before Taiwan holds presidential and legislative races, but truly democratic elections like these are not in China's vocabulary. Taiwan, on the other hand, has developed into a vibrant democracy and is proud of its system.\nOver dinner, Mr Ma could share his low approval rating headaches with Mr Xi and even make jokes about how hard it is to finish a speech when protesters are trying to throw shoes at him. Mr Xi might just politely smile and think to himself: \"And you wonder why we run things like we do?\"\nMr Xi will be eager to push relations forward. During Mr Ma's seven years in office, the two sides have signed many agreements - from those that have allowed first-ever direct flights to ones that bring millions of Chinese tourists to Taiwan each year, not to mention tariff-cutting trade deals.\nChina is eager to link Taiwan's economy and society even closer to the mainland's, and begin talking about unification.\nBut Mr Ma will have to explain that public opinion does not support more deals and such talks at the moment. Many people are worried too many deals signed too quickly and without enough public oversight may make the island over-dependent on China and vulnerable to unification pressures.\nMr Ma might explain to Mr Xi: \"In Taiwan, unlike mainland China, public opinion matters a lot. That is how I got my job in the first place.\"\nLike many Chinese people who consider Taiwan the long-lost sibling they must see at least once in their lifetime, Mr Xi would want to eventually travel to \"our treasured island\" which is what many Chinese people call Taiwan.\nBut Mr Ma will not be able to extend the invitation. That would be asking for trouble. Given China's motive for developing stronger ties, Taiwanese not in favour of this would simply use it as a chance to protest, and perhaps throw shoes at Mr Xi.\nMr Ma says the past seven years have brought about the most stable and peaceful period in cross-strait relations in 66 years. One of his hopes before his presidency ends next May is to use these talks to institutionalise meetings between leaders of the two sides so that relations will stay on the right track, and the two sides can have dialogue at the highest level, regardless of which political party comes into power in Taiwan.\nBut Mr Xi would probably say: \"That all depends on whether the next leader agrees to our condition.\" And the condition is to accept that Taiwan and mainland China are part of one China. So far, the candidate tipped to win, Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence opposition party, has refused to do that.\nIt's almost sacrilegious in the shared Chinese culture of Taiwan and China to split the bill in a formal banquet, but at the Singapore dinner, the two sides will have to deal with the awkward moment when the bill comes.\nThey've decided to split it because not doing so would give the impression that one is a host and the other a guest, and that they are not meeting on an equal level. And that would cause trouble for Mr Ma, because he's facing domestic pressure not to give any suggestion that Taiwan is a lesser, weaker party in the talks.\nBut while some think Mr Ma shouldn't meet Mr Xi, others believe two former enemies agreeing to talk can only be a good thing. They hope the talks can raise mutual understanding and trust - and perhaps that will happen over a few glasses of Singapore Sling.","summary":"On Saturday, for the first time since their bitter split at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, the leaders of China and Taiwan will meet."}

It became apparent earlier in the year that sales of the iPhone - surely the most profitable product in history - had plateaued and they continued to disappoint this quarter. It was hard to spot any product or market delivering outstanding results - the fact that Apple still hasn't released any figures for its Watch tells its own story - and the 30% fall in China sales looked particularly worrying.\nBut somehow Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook still managed to paint a rosy picture. He pointed to the 24% rise in income from services like Apple Music and Apple Pay. He told us that he was thrilled with the response of customers to the iPhone 7 - and that round the world, including in China, demand was outstripping supply.\nAnd crucially he looked forward to a return to growth in the next quarter, with Apple forecasting a record-breaking holiday season. Investors have been looking for reasons to buy back into Apple and that prediction may help continue the recent upward path of the shares.\nBut the technology crowd is still waiting for some radical new innovation, to prove the company founded by Steve Jobs hasn't lost its creative spark. Tim Cook wouldn't be drawn when quizzed about moves into TV or building a car or a connected speaker like the Amazon Echo. He did say \"we have the strongest product pipeline we've ever had\". But that is a line we have been hearing for some time.\nApple executives said demand for the new iPhone 7 was strong, despite fiscal fourth-quarter revenue falls in China and the Americas, its two most important markets.\nRevenue from Greater China, once seen as Apple's next growth hope, fell 30% in the quarter, after dropping 33% in the previous quarter.\nIn the same period last year, revenue from Greater China doubled.\nApple's shares were down 3% at about $114.80 in after-hours trading.\n\"Apple didn't have a great [fourth quarter] as iPhones, Macs, China, the US and what appears to be Watch were down,\" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\nNet income fell to $9.01bn in the fourth quarter, down from $11bn in the same quarter last year.\nFor the year, net income fell to $45.7bn from $53.4bn.\nChief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said it was \"impossible to know\" if there was any effect yet from rival Samsung halting production of Galaxy Note 7 phones earlier this month.","summary":"Apple has reported its third quarter in a row of falling iPhone sales and revenue, but sales beat analyst expectations."}

Government sources say the main figure arrested is Saleh Makki, a hitherto relatively unknown member of the political opposition with no association with rebels in the past.\nSome are speculating that there may be a connection to Chad's recent military interventions abroad and President Deby recently accused Libya of supporting militias against him. Recent threats from the former Chadian rebel group UFR do not carry much weight as they are a spent force.\nWhat is known is that it is very difficult for the opposition to win an election - weak and divided they boycotted the 2011 presidential vote which Mr Deby won with 83%.\nMr Deby changed the constitution to abolish presidential term limits in 2005.\nPolice sources told the AFP news agency a shoot-out took place on the outskirts of N'Djamena, with three members of the security forces being among the dead.\n\"A small group of ill-intentioned individuals attempted to carry out a destabilisation plot against the institutions of the republic,\" a government statement said.\nIt said that the country's security forces \"neutralised\" them, without specifying how many people were involved in the alleged action.\nProsecutor Mahamat Saleh Youssouf named the generals who had been arrested as Weiddig Assi Assoue and Ngomine Beadmadji David.\nRuling coalition MP Mahamat Malloum and opposition MP Saleh Makki had also been arrested, he said.\nMr Makki's coalition Co-ordination of Political Parties for the Defence of the Constitution (CPDC), told the BBC it was confused by his arrest.\nMr Makki was arrested by police between 21:00 and 22:00 local time on Wednesday evening, his wife told the CPDC.\nOur reporter says it is not clear what charges they will face.\nSince its independence from France in 1960, Chad's history has been marked by instability and violence stemming mostly from tension between the mainly Arab-Muslim north and the predominantly Christian and animist south.\nMr Deby has survived two attacks on the capital - in 2006 and 2008 - from rebels in eastern Chad.\nThese rebels were supported by Sudan's government, which was unhappy that Darfuri rebels were using eastern Chad as a base. But a rapprochement between Chad and Sudan in 2010 has helped bring peace to that region.\nEarlier this year, Chad deployed some 2,000 troops to help French forces oust Islamists who had seized large swathes of territory in Mali.\nFrance said it had noted the latest events in Chad \"with concern\" and called on the government and opposition to engage in  \"calm and constructive dialogue\", AFP reports.","summary":"At least four people were killed in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, as government forces foiled a \"destabilisation plot\" against President Idriss Deby, officials said."}

They refused and the bus drove off.\nThe situation then rapidly escalated and reports indicate at least one person died and three others were injured after police fired shots.\nThe exact details of the incident are hard to verify, but what is clear is that days of protest followed, including armed local militia clashing with federal police, leaving seven policemen dead, the government says.\nOromia at a glance:\nWhy Ethiopia is making a historic \u2018master plan\u2019 U-turn\nSince last November, Ethiopia has seen a third phase of the recent unrest in the Oromia region which has been unprecedented in its longevity and geographical spread.\nThe region is the largest in Ethiopia and the Oromos, who make up a third of the population, are the biggest of the country's more than 80 ethnic groups.\nInitially the protests were in reaction to a plan to expand the administrative border of the capital, Addis Ababa, which is encircled by Oromia.\nBut even after the region's governing party, the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation, which is part of Ethiopia's governing coalition, shelved the plan in January, protests have continued.\n\"There is a strong sense of victimhood, extending back 150 years,\" says Daniel Berhane, a prominent Addis Ababa-based political blogger, covering Ethiopia for the website Horn Affairs.\n\"People remember the history. The scars are still alive, such as how the Oromo language was suppressed until 20 years ago.\"\nDespite there being an ethnic basis to these protests, observers say that the deeper issues behind them, frustrations over land ownership, corruption, political and economic marginalisation, are familiar to many disenchanted Ethiopians.\nThe numbers killed since November following clashes between protesters and security forces given by international rights organisations, activists and observers range from 80 to 250.\nThe government has dismissed various death tolls as exaggerations, and said that a recent report on the situation by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) was an \"absolute lie\".\nEthiopian citizens had a right to question the plan to expand Addis Ababa, but the protests were hijacked by people looking to incite violence, according to government spokesman Getachew Reda.\nHe says the security forces have faced \"organised armed gangs burning down buildings belonging to private citizens, along with government installations\".\nA security analyst who closely watches Ethiopia says \"there could be radical elements and factions taking advantage, but you cannot define a movement by isolated events\".\nDespite violent incidents, the protests have been described as \"largely peaceful\" by HRW and observers in Ethiopia.\n\"There is a perception of lack of competence in governance on the ground,\" Mr Daniel says.\n\"There were easy remedies to appease initial protests, it was not hard science, but the right actions were not taken.\"\nIn its defence, the government says it heeded the call of the people when it came to concerns over the Addis Ababa plan, and observers say the government deserves credit for withdrawing it.\nBut the same political observers add that the government must allow Ethiopians to exercise their constitutional right to protest, and handle events in a way that does not escalate violence.\nThe government has said that the protests and information about them have been manipulated by foreign-based opposition groups who are using social media to exaggerate what is going on for their own ends.\n\"The diaspora magnifies news of what is happening, yes, but no matter how much it agitates, it cannot direct [what's happening] at village level in Ethiopia,\" says Jawar Mohammed, executive director of one of those accused of fomenting conflict, US-based broadcaster Oromia Media Network (OMN).\n\"This is about dissatisfaction.\"\nMr Jawar says the imprisonment of leaders of the Oromo Federalist Congress party, Oromia's largest legally registered opposition political party, along with thousands of other Oromo political prisoners, makes it difficult to negotiate a lasting solution.\n\"Also what is the UK and US doing? As major donors to Ethiopia they should be taking the lead to get the government to work out an agreement.\"\nThis is a long way from the heady days of Ethiopia's new federal constitution after the overthrow of the military dictatorship in 1991.\nThat introduced a decentralised system of ethnic federalism, but this jars with the dominance of the governing Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which, along with its allies, holds every seat in parliament.\n\"The ruling government is a victim of its own success,\" the security analyst says.\n\"The constitution it developed made promises and people trusted the EPRDF. Now people are demanding those rights and the government is responding with bullets and violence.\"\nHe adds that the government has expanded basic services and infrastructure, and appears to respect different cultural and ethnic identities, but it cannot reconcile this with its more authoritarian decision-making process.\nThe government's hitherto successful job of holding together this particularly heterogeneous federation is not about to crumble, according to observers here.\nBut things may get worse before they get better, unless underlying sources of friction and frustration are addressed.","summary":"As protests in Ethiopia over the rights of the country's Oromo people continue, Addis Ababa-based journalist James Jeffrey considers if they are threatening the country's unity."}

Britain is walking tall again.\n\"Five years ago, our economy had suffered a collapse greater than almost any country.\n\"Today, I can confirm: in the last year we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world.\"\nHe said he would use a boost in the public finances caused by lower inflation and welfare payments to pay off some of the national debt and end the squeeze on public spending a year earlier than planned.\nIn 2019\/20 spending will grow in line with the growth of the economy - bringing state spending as a share of national income to the same level as in 2000, the chancellor told MPs.\nThe BBC's Robert Peston said this was a move aimed at neutralising Labour's claim that the Conservatives would cut spending to 1930s levels.\nBut Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the Treasury's own figures showed spending at the \"lowest level since 1938\" in 2018\/19 while the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, in its analysis, said Mr Osborne's plans implied a \"rollercoaster profile\" for expenditure over the next five years.\nMr Osborne insisted that deficit reduction remained his top priority but also unveiled measures aimed at increasing the amount people can earn before paying tax to \u00a310,800 next year and an above inflation rise to \u00a343,300 by 2017 for the amount people can earn before having to pay the 40p tax rate.\nSome of the plans in Mr Osborne's statement are likely to depend on a Conservative victory on 7 May. Whoever wins the election is likely to set out another Budget later this year.\nIf you think getting the debt down is the big priority, the last five years have seen a good deal of austerity for very delayed gain.\nIt is taking precisely twice as long as George Osborne hoped to get the debt down to 70% of GDP.\nAnd to achieve that deferred gain, the Office for Budget Responsibility says the acuteness of austerity will get worse, before it gets a lot better.\nRead Robert's full analysis here.\nLabour leader Ed Miliband claimed the Conservatives had a \"secret plan\" to cut the NHS because they would not be able to deliver their planned \"colossal cuts\" to other areas of public spending and they would also be forced to increase VAT.\nHe said Labour would reverse the tax cuts for millionaires and introduce a mansion tax to fund the NHS.\nHe also pledged to abolish the \"vindictive and unfair\" housing benefit changes he calls the \"bedroom tax\".\nThe SNP said Mr Osborne had \"blown his last chance\" to deliver for Scotland.\nSNP deputy leader and Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie said: \"Today George Osborne could have delivered a Budget focused on delivering economic growth by tackling inequality.\n\"He has not - he has decided to continue with his utterly failed austerity agenda.\"\nThe chancellor sprayed largesse far and wide - on drinkers and drivers, orchestras and air ambulances, churches and charities.\nSo yes no massive giveaway, no massive rabbit, as some Tory MPs had wanted, but a glimpse of better things to come and the road - as Mr Osborne put it - from austerity to prosperity. But the essential political argument hasn't changed.\nRead James's full analysis here.\nUKIP Leader Nigel Farage said: \"Mr Osborne talks about a long-term economic plan, today he pushed all his targets back and created a long grass economic plan.\"\nGreen Party leader Natalie Bennett said the chancellor's \"triumphalist tone\" would \"leave a bad taste in the mouth\" of people on zero hours contracts or struggling to put food on the table.\nPlaid Cymru Treasury spokesman Jonathan Edwards said: \"This was a 'jam tomorrow' Budget from a chancellor who is busy sharpening the axe ready for the next Parliament.\"\nMr Osborne's sixth Budget statement came against a backdrop of a strengthening economic recovery, a fresh fall in unemployment and a rosier picture expected as a result of falling oil prices dragging down inflation.\nIn was, in parts, an openly electioneering Budget, with Mr Osborne saying: \"The critical choice facing the country now is this: do we return to the chaos of the past? Or do we say to the British people, let's work through the plan that is delivering for you?\"\nThe Budget was largely welcomed by business leaders with CBI Director General John Cridland saying it would provide the \"stability and consistency\" needed to boost growth.\nThe trade unions were less impressed, with the TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady saying: \"He did not spell out where, if re-elected, he will make the huge spending cuts he plans for the next Parliament, nor did he tell Britain's low paid workers which of their benefits he will cut.\"","summary":"George Osborne has announced tax cuts for first-time buyers, workers and savers in his final Budget before May's general election."}

Overall it does little to bring down the level of overall crime.\"\nOf those which responded, 39 forces in England and Wales provided annual breakdowns, which suggested payments had fallen from \u00a34.1m in 2011\/12 to just over \u00a33.1m last year.\nNorth Wales Police paid out the smallest amount, handing over just under \u00a340,000 over five years.\nSouth Yorkshire Police and Cleveland Police did not provide figures.\nPolice forces are audited on their use of informants and are inspected annually by the Office of Surveillance Commissioners to ensure they are not breaking the law.\nA Home Office spokesman said decisions on the operational deployment of resources \"are matters for chief constables\", adding: \"There is no question that the police still have the resources to do their important work.\n\"We have provided a fair provisional funding deal for 2017\/18.\n\"It provides stable funding for the police and enables essential policing reform and transformation to go further and faster so that we help the vulnerable, cut crime and support our communities.\"","summary":"Police forces across the UK paid out at least \u00a322m to informants over the last five years, according to figures obtained by BBC Radio 5 live."}

We're aiming to achieve a substantial majority if we can.\"\nHe added: \"We tend to take the attitude that there isn't so much as a 'No' voter in Scotland, there are only deferred 'Yeses', and that's been one of the successes of our campaign.\"\nAsked if he would seek another referendum if there was a \"No\" vote on Thursday, the SNP leader said: \"If you remember that previous constitutional referendum in Scotland - there was one in 1979 and then the next one was 1997.\n\"That's what I mean by a political generation.\n\"In my opinion, and it is just my opinion, this is a once in a generation opportunity for Scotland.\"\nMr Darling commented: \"I said a year ago that this race would narrow as we got towards the wire and that is precisely what has happened.\n\"It's not surprising. It's the biggest single decision we will ever take.\n\"If we vote to leave the UK on Thursday then there's no going back.

Excluding undecided voters it found \"Yes\" to be on 54% and \"No\" on 46%.\nThe poll was carried out between 10 and 12 September and had a sample size of 705 - smaller than many of the other polls.\nA referendum on whether Scotland should become independent is to take place\nMeanwhile, a leading economist has said there is \"little basis\" for \"fear-mongering\" over the economy of an independent Scotland.\nJoseph Stiglitz countered the view of fellow Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, who recently warned that Scotland would face \"huge risks\" going it alone and told Scots to \"be very afraid\".\nMr Stiglitz said that while there would be risks in the event of a Yes vote, the risks of Scotland remaining in the union and UK leaving the EU would be \"significantly greater\".\nIn an article published in the Sunday Herald and the Scotsman, he urged Scots to focus on \"vision and values\" in the last few days before the crucial vote.\nHe said: \"Krugman, for instance, suggests that there are significant economies of scale: a small economy is likely, he seems to suggest, not to do well.\n\"But an independent Scotland will still be part of Europe, and the great success of the EU is the creation of a large economic zone.\n\"By an order of magnitude, far more important than size is the pursuit of the right policies.\"","summary":"Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said the independence referendum was \"a once in a generation opportunity\" and he was aiming for \"a substantial majority\"."}

Everything seemed to be going as planned.\nShortly afterwards, the captain told the co-pilot he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications. The cockpit door is heard opening and closing on the recording.\nSeconds later, shortly before 09:31, the selected altitude was changed from 38,000 ft to 100 ft and the plane began its descent.\nAt 09:33, the plane's speed increased. Air traffic control contacted the co-pilot - and continued to do so over the coming minutes - but received no answer.\nA buzzer requesting access to the cockpit sounded at 09:34. Knocking and muffled voices asking for the door to be opened  can be heard until the end of the recording.\nAt 09:39, \"noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions\" over the course of a minute. The flight crew of another plane also tried to make contact with the cockpit by radio around this time.\nIn the next minute - 93 seconds before impact - \"low amplitude inputs\" on the co-pilot's flight controls were recorded. But the level of movement was too low to disengage the autopilot, so the input made no change to the flight path.\nThe \"Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull up\" warning was triggered at 09:40: 41 and it continues until the end of the recording at 09:41:06.\nFrench prosecutor Brice Robin gave details of events on board the Airbus when he briefed journalists after the cockpit voice recorder was analysed in the days after the crash.\nDuring the first 20 minutes of the flight, he said, the co-pilot's responses were courteous but he became \"curt\" when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing.\nIt was shortly after this that the captain left the cockpit, probably to go to the toilet, and within seconds Lubitz had altered the flight monitoring system to send the aircraft into descent.\n\"This action on the altitude controls can only be deliberate,\" said Mr Robin.\nIn the 10 minutes it took for the plane to plummet through the sky, Lubitz did not say a word and his breathing remained normal - despite repeated attempts by crew members and air traffic control to get him to respond.\nThe Airbus descended at a rate of about 3-4,000ft per minute. The last radar contact was at 09.40:47 GMT at 6,175ft.\nDuring the very last moment of the recording passengers can be heard screaming.

It will be interesting to see if the pitch benefits the Falcons and their much talked about change of playing style - or enable the opposition to move further away.\n\"Ambitions at Kingston Park will again be survival.\"\nIan Smith's Premiership prediction: 11th\nHow have Saints fared in the transfer market?\nBBC Radio Northampton's Ian Hunter: \"Fly-half Joel Hodgson is one of champions Saints' two signings this summer - the other being back-row Jon Fisher - and director of rugby Jim Mallinder is looking at the former for the nine spot, but I cannot see that improving on Kahn Fotuali'i and Lee Dickson.\n\"Last year was great for young player development. Saints were able to bring players through players including Tom Stephenson, Tom Collins, Will Hooley, James Craig, Mike Haywood, Alex and Ethan Waller and I expect a number of them to push for regular places this season.\n\"Where could they add strength? A world-class right-winger wouldn't go amiss - power, searing pace or both is always difficult to defend against. Jamie Elliot and Ken Pisi are quality players and I'm nit-picking for the best. A concern I do have is an understudy to fly-half Steven Myler. We saw how much Saints missed him last year when he was out.\"\nWhat are their hopes and ambitions for the new season? \"They came into last season as the nearly men but they managed to shake that title. Mallinder will not want that to be a one-off. That is why this year is even more important to the future of the club and this group of players.\n\"Another successful season will project Northampton from a good club to a great one, or at least going in that direction. With success comes the ease of retaining and attracting talent on the pitch, and off it the commercial upshot of more lucrative sponsorship deals.\n\"Mallinder will definitely have one eye on the European Rugby Champions Cup. The Saints have a very good draw and a great shot of throwing their hat in the ring for the final rounds. League and European glory? That might be a bridge too far but Mallinder will be disappointed if he doesn't get one of them. That's his ambition - and mine.\"\nIan Hunter's Premiership prediction: First\nHow have Sale fared in the transfer market?\nBBC Radio Manchester's Nathan Middleton: \"After losing some of their young English talent over the summer, Steve Diamond has replaced them with proven internationals, with Nathan Hines, Luke McLean and Alberto de Marchi joining. Elsewhere, Chris Cusiter is a more than able replacement for the departing Dwayne Peel at scrum-half and Magnus Lund could be one of the Premiership's most inspired signings.\"\nWhat are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?\n\"Sale will be looking to push on from their top-half finish last season and have ambitions of getting into the top four, which they had a sniff at in the closing months of the last campaign.\n\"The Sharks will ultimately be looking to finish sixth or better again but have targeted beating more of the top sides, as well as being competitive in their difficult European Rugby Champions Cup group.\"\nNathan Middleton's Premiership prediction: Sixth\nHow have Sarries fared in the transfer market?\nBBC London 94.9's Andrew Rowley: \"It has been a quieter summer by the standards of recent years at Saracens.

The injury to Mako Vunipola is a blow but they have the cover.\"\nWhat are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?\n\"Saracens enter every tournament with the ambition to win it, as demonstrated by their final appearances in both the Premiership and Heineken Cup last season. It would be a huge shock if they are not in the mix for both competitions again come May next year.\n\"It will rankle with the leaders at the club that for all the impressive progress on and off the field in the last few years, the 2011-12 Premiership title is still the only trophy to show for all their hard work and investment.\n\"Last season they recorded a record points total in the regular Premiership season and I can see them finishing top of the pile again.

While the loss of Tom Palmer (Gloucester) and Charlie Hayter (England Sevens) will be felt, there's plenty of incoming talent.\n\"The arrival of Sale's James Gaskell could see a formidable second-row partnership built with Joe Launchbury. Keep an eye out for Scotland's Ruaridh Jackson pushing Andy Goode at fly-half, along with Hurricanes Super 15 import Alapati Leiua causing chaos across the backline.\"\nWhat are their hopes and ambitions for the new season?\n\"Wasps' potential has never quite been realised in recent seasons because of their ongoing medical bill.\n\"Seeing both Tom Varndell and Christian Wade as regulars on the team sheet should do wonders for the fans' nerves. If they pick up this season where they left off the last - doing the double over Stade Francais to secure the last European Rugby Champions Cup spot - this maturing team will cause problems for others in all competitions.\n\"Dai Young will have been hard pressed to ignore the number of points scored against them in their 2013-14 campaign and no doubt attention will have been paid to tighten up their defence. The announcement of 'The Brand' James Haskell as captain has been hugely popular with the Wasps fans, as the England flanker leads by example on the pitch. He'll be looking to impress for his club to hopefully force the issue of selection for his country, with the 2015 World Cup now in touching distance.\"\nSara Orchard's Premiership prediction: Sixth","summary":"It seems like only yesterday that television match official Graham Hughes was deliberating over whether to award the try that would win Northampton the Premiership title at Rugby HQ."}

If you like, that's the part of the program that learns the intuitive part of Go.\n\"It now plays different versions of itself millions and millions of times, and each time it gets incrementally better. It learns from its mistakes.\n\"The final step is known as the Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is really the planning stage.\n\"Now it has all the intuitive knowledge about which positions are good in Go, it can make long-range plans.\"\nTested against rival Go-playing AIs, Google's system won 499 out of 500 matches,\nAnd last October, DeepMind invited Fan Hui, Europe's top player, to its London office for a series of games, each of which the AI won.\n\"Many of the best programmers in the world were asked last year how long it would take for a program to beat a top professional, and most of them were predicting 10-plus years,\" Mr Hassabis said.\n\"The reasons it was quicker than people expected was the pace of the innovation going on with the underlying algorithms and also how much more potential you can get by combining different algorithms together.\"\nProf Zoubin Ghahramani, of the University of Cambridge, said: \"This is certainly a major breakthrough for AI, with wider implications.\n\"The technical idea that underlies it is the idea of reinforcement learning - getting computers to learn to improve their behaviour to achieve goals.\n\"That could be used for decision-making problems - to help doctors make treatment plans, for example, in businesses or anywhere where you'd like to have computers assist humans in decision making.\n\"It doesn't mean that Google is ahead of all other companies in AI - there are many artificial intelligences.\n\"But in terms of devoting resources to Go, Google has clearly done more.\n\"Facebook has achieved some pretty spectacular results in other areas of artificial intelligence, but I think Google has beaten them to this particularly important challenge.\"\nDeepMind now intends to pit AlphaGo against Lee Sedol - the world's top Go player - in Seoul in March.\nIn addition, it continues to develop AI systems that can play computer games without any help, following last year's success at getting its bots to teach themselves how to play several dozen classics.\n\"For us, Go is the pinnacle of board game challenges,\" said Mr Hassabis.\n\"Now, we are moving towards 3D games or simulations that are much more like the real world rather than the Atari games we tackled last year. \"","summary":"A Google artificial intelligence program has beaten the European champion of the board game Go."}
