## Mission

While there is a lot of talk about the need to train AI models that are safe, robust, and fair - few tools have been made available to data scientists to meet these goals. As a result, the front line of NLP models in production systems reflects a sorry state of affairs. 

We propose here an early stage open-source community project that aims to fill this gap, and would love for you to join us on this mission. We aim to build on the foundation laid by previous research such as [Ribeiro et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04118), [Song et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00053), [Parrish et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08193), [van Aken et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15512) and many others. 

[John Snow Labs](www.johnsnowlabs.com) has a full development team allocated to the project and is committed to improving the library for years, as we do with other open-source libraries. Expect frequent releases with new test types, tasks, languages, and platforms to be added regularly. We look forward to working together to make safe, reliable, and responsible NLP an everyday reality.
