## Contribution Process

1. ### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

2. ### Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://github.com/RakshitKhajuria/test/assets/71117423/b07c7d60-ab80-4b7f-b972-58fcd1f50741" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/langtest.git
```

where `username` is your GitHub username.

3. ### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd langtest
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout -b` command:

```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

4. **Set Up Environment**: Create a virtual environment for LangTest using your preferred method. For example, you can use `venv` or `conda`.

5. ### Install Poetry

Poetry is the package manager used for this project. If you don't have Poetry installed, run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

6. ### Install Dependencies

Use Poetry to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev
   ```
   
7. ### Make necessary changes and commit those changes 

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command with a meaningful message:

```
git commit -m "Add feature: feature-name" 
```

8. ### Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

9. ### Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

10. ### Create a pull request (PR)

Create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to the main LangTest repository.
- Clearly describe the changes you've made and the issue it addresses in the PR description.
- If the PR is related to an existing issue, mention it using the syntax "Fixes #issue_number."
