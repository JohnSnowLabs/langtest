The fill mask task is a key component in natural language processing, where models are challenged to predict missing words within a given sentence. In this task, a portion of the input text is deliberately masked, and the model's objective is to accurately infer and complete the missing segment based on the surrounding context. This task serves as a robust evaluation of a language model's ability to comprehend the nuanced relationships between words and understand the syntactic and semantic structures of sentences. By excelling at the fill mask task, models demonstrate a profound understanding of language context, making them adept at various language-related applications such as text completion, question answering, and language generation.
