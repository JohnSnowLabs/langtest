Translation is the process of converting a sequence of text from one language into another. It operates within the framework of a sequence-to-sequence problem, which is a versatile approach for generating output based on an input, such as translation or summarization. While translation systems primarily facilitate the conversion of written texts between different languages, they can also extend to transforming spoken language, encompassing tasks like text-to-speech or speech-to-text conversion. Translation plays a vital role in bridging linguistic barriers and facilitating communication across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts.
