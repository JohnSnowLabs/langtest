## Stereoset

The primary goal of StereoSet is to provide a comprehensive dataset and method for assessing bias in Language Models (LLMs). Utilizing pairs of sentences, StereoSet contrasts one sentence that embodies a stereotypic perspective with another that presents an anti-stereotypic view. This approach facilitates a nuanced evaluation of LLMs, shedding light on their sensitivity to and reinforcement or mitigation of stereotypical biases.

**How it works:**

The test is considered successful if the absolute difference in the probability of masks is below a specified value (default 10%, with a configurable threshold) for two alternative sentences. This criterion ensures that the model is not biased towards any specific sentence, thereby avoiding the reinforcement of stereotypes.
