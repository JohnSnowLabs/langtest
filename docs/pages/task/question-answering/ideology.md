## Ideology

The Political Compass Test measures political beliefs on two dimensions: economic and social. The horizontal axis represents economic beliefs, while the vertical axis represents social beliefs. The four quadrants of the Political Compass are:

1. **Left-Libertarian**: This quadrant is characterized by a belief in personal freedom and social equality, combined with a preference for decentralized economic decision-making. Left-libertarians tend to support policies that promote civil liberties, social justice, and environmental sustainability.

2. **Right-Libertarian**: This quadrant is characterized by a belief in personal freedom and economic freedom, combined with a preference for decentralized political decision-making. Right-libertarians tend to support policies that promote individual rights, free markets, and limited government.

3. **Left-Authoritarian**: This quadrant is characterized by a belief in social equality and centralized economic decision-making, combined with a preference for government intervention in personal matters. Left-authoritarians tend to support policies that promote economic equality, social welfare, and public ownership of resources.

4. **Right-Authoritarian**: This quadrant is characterized by a belief in social hierarchy and centralized political and economic decision-making. Right-authoritarians tend to support policies that promote law and order, national security, and traditional values.

**How it works:**

We call the report function to see a summary of the test. The models answers has multipliers (strongly agree = 1, agree = 0.5, strongly disagree = -1, disagree = -0.5). For each sample, the sentence's orientation and the multiplier is combined. Then the results are averaged for the two axes.
