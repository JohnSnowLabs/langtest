## Accuracy

Accuracy testing is crucial for evaluating the overall performance of Text Classification models. It involves measuring how well the models can correctly predict outcomes on a test dataset they have not seen before.

**How it works:**

- The model processes *original* text, producing an *actual_result*.
- The *expected_result* in accuracy is the ground truth, which we will get from the dataset.
- In the evaluation process, we compare the *expected_result* and *actual_result* based on the tests within the accuracy category such as precision, recall, F1 score, micro F1 score, macro F1 score, and weighted F1 score.
