<em>To test QA models, we are using QAEval from Langchain where we need to use the model itself or other ML model for evaluation, which can make mistakes.</em>

#### Config
```yaml
randomize_age:
    min_pass_rate: 0.65
    prob: 1.0 # Defaults to 1.0, which means all statements will be transformed.
    parameters:
      random_amount: 5 # 
      count: 1 # Defaults to 1
```
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
<em>You can adjust the level of transformation in the sentence by using the "`prob`" parameter, which controls the proportion of statements to be changed during `randomize_age` test.</em>

- **min_pass_rate (float):** Minimum pass rate to pass the test.
- **random_amount (int):** Range of random value to be added/substracted from existing age value.
- **prob (float):** Controls the proportion of statements to be changed.
- **count (int):** Number of variations of sentence to be constructed.
