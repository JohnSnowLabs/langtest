## Lowercase

This test checks if the NLP model can handle input text that is in all lowercase. Like the uppercase test, this is important to ensure that your NLP model can handle input text in any case.

**alias_name:** `lowercase`

<em>To test QA models, we are using QAEval from Langchain where we need to use the model itself or other ML model for evaluation, which can make mistakes.</em>

#### Config
```yaml
lowercase:
    min_pass_rate: 0.8
    prob: 0.5 # Defaults to 1.0, which means all words will be transformed.
```
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
<em>You can adjust the level of transformation in the sentence by using the "`prob`" parameter, which controls the proportion of words to be changed during `lowercase` test.</em>

- **min_pass_rate (float):** Minimum pass rate to pass the test.
- **prob (float):** Controls the proportion of words to be changed.
