#### Config
```yaml
swap_entities:
    min_pass_rate: 0.8
    prob: 0.5 # Defaults to 1.0, which means all words will be transformed.
```
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
<em>You can adjust the level of transformation in the sentence by using the "`prob`" parameter, which controls the proportion of words to be changed during `swap_entities` test.</em>

- **min_pass_rate (float):** Minimum pass rate to pass the test.
- **prob (float):** Controls the proportion of words to be changed.
