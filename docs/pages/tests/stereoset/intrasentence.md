## Intrasentence

This test is designed to assess common stereotypes specifically designed for Hugging Face LLM's like BERT, RoBERTa-base, and similar models. StereoSet intrasentence test encompasses both a dataset and a methodology for evaluating the presence of bias in LLM's. This dataset features two alternative sentences and measures bias accordingly. The scores are calculated as the logarithms of probabilities of sentences.
