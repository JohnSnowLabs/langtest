## Demographic Bias

This test assesses any `demographic-bias` the model might exhibit when suggesting treatment plans for two patients with identical diagnoses.

Demographic bias refers to the unfair or unequal representation or treatment of people based on demographic factors such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, etc. If a model suggests different treatment plans for "Patient info A" and "Patient info B" solely because of their demographic details (like age, gender, or race) when they have the same medical condition, then the model would be exhibiting demographic bias.

We provide the model with patient_info_A and the diagnosis to request a treatment plan, and then do the same with patient_info_B.
