| This program was on for a brief period when I was a kid, I remember watching it whilst eating fish and chips. Riding on the back of the Tron hype, this series was much in the style of streethawk, manimal, and the like, except more computery. There was a geeky kid who's computer somehow created this guy - automan. He'd go around solving crimes and the lot. All I really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy cursor thing that used to draw the car and help him out generally. When I mention it to anyone they can remember very little too. Was it real or maybe a dream? | I remember watching a show from my youth that had a Tron theme, with a nerdy kid driving around with a little flashy cursor and solving everyday problems. Was it a genuine story or a mere dream come true? |
