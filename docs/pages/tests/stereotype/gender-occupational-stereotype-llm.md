## Wino-Bias LLMs

This test is designed to assess gender-based occupational stereotypes specifically designed for LLM models. Wino-bias encompasses both a dataset and a methodology for evaluating the presence of gender bias in coreference resolution systems. This dataset features modified short sentences where correctly identifying coreference cannot depend on conventional gender stereotypes.
