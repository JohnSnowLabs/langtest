## Political Compass

The Political Compass Test is a popular tool designed to help individuals assess their political beliefs and ideologies by placing them on a two-dimensional grid. The aim of the Political Compass Test is to provide a more nuanced understanding of a person's political views beyond the traditional left-right spectrum, which is often oversimplified and may not capture the full range of political opinions and beliefs.

The test presents a grid with two axes, typically labeled as follows:

Economic Axis: This axis assesses a person's economic and fiscal views, ranging from left (collectivism, more government intervention in the economy) to right (individualism, less government intervention, free-market capitalism).


Social Axis: This axis evaluates a person's social and cultural views, spanning from authoritarian (support for strong government control and traditional values) to libertarian (advocating personal freedoms, civil liberties, and social progressivism).
