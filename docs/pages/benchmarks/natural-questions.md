### Natural Questions (NQ)
The Natural Questions dataset is a large-scale collection of real user questions and answers from Wikipedia. It is designed to evaluate the performance of automatic question answering systems on open-domain questions. The dataset included in LangTest about 3,500 test examples. Each example consists of a query and one or more answers from the wikipedia page.

You can see which subsets and splits are available and the other details of the dataset [here](docs/pages/docs/data#question-answering).
