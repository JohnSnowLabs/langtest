LangTest supports many benchmark datasets for testing your models. These are generally for LLM's and focus on different
abilities of LLM's such as question answering and summarization. There are also benchmarks to test a model's performance on
metrics like factuality and toxicity.

### BoolQ
The BoolQ dataset is a collection of yes/no questions that are naturally occurring and generated in unprompted and unconstrained settings. The dataset contains about 16k examples, each consisting of a question, a passage, and an answer. The questions are about various topics and require reading comprehension and reasoning skills to answer. The dataset is intended to explore the surprising difficulty of natural yes/no questions and to benchmark natural language understanding systems.

### NarrativeQA
The NarrativeQA dataset is a collection of stories and questions designed to test reading comprehension, especially on long documents. The dataset contains many stories from various genres, such as books, movie scripts, and news articles. For each story, there are multiple questions and answers that require understanding the plot, characters, and events of the story. The dataset is challenging because the questions are not answerable by simple keyword matching or extraction, but require inference and reasoning based on the whole story.

The CommonsenseQA dataset is a multiple-choice question answering dataset that aims to test the ability of natural language processing models to answer questions that require commonsense knowledge. The dataset consists of questions with five choices each. The questions were generated by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, who were asked to create questions based on a given source concept and three target concepts related to it. The questions require different types of commonsense knowledge to predict the correct answers. The dataset covers various topics such as science, history, and everyday life.
