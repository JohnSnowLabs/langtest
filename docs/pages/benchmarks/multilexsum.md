Source: [Multi-LexSum: Real-World Summaries of Civil Rights Lawsuits at Multiple Granularities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10883)

The Multi-LexSum dataset is a collection of summaries of civil rights litigation lawsuits with summaries of three granularities. The dataset is designed to evaluate the performance of abstractive multi-document summarization systems. The dataset was created by multilexsum and is available on GitHub. The dataset is distinct from other datasets in its multiple target summaries, each at a different granularity (ranging from one-sentence “extreme” summaries to multi-paragraph narrations of over five hundred words).



You can see which subsets and splits are available below.
