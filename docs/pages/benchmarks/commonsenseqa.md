Source: [CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting Commonsense Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00937)

The CommonsenseQA dataset is a multiple-choice question answering dataset that aims to test the ability of natural language processing models to answer questions that require commonsense knowledge. The dataset consists of questions with five choices each. The questions were generated by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, who were asked to create questions based on a given source concept and three target concepts related to it. The questions require different types of commonsense knowledge to predict the correct answers. The dataset covers various topics such as science, history, and everyday life.
You can see which subsets and splits are available below.
