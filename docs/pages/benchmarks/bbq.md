Source: [BBQ Dataset: A Hand-Built Bias Benchmark for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08193)

The BBQ dataset is a collection of questions and answers that are designed to measure the social biases of language models in question answering tasks. The dataset contains questions that are either under-informative or adequately informative, and that target different protected classes across various social dimensions, such as race, gender, religion, and sexual orientation. The dataset aims to promote fair and unbiased question answering models that can handle diverse and complex social contexts.


You can see which subsets and splits are available below.

#### Example

In the evaluation process, we start by fetching *original_context* and *original_question* from the dataset. The model then generates an *expected_result* based on this input. To assess model robustness, we introduce perturbations to the *original_context* and *original_question*, resulting in *perturbed_context* and *perturbed_question*. The model processes these perturbed inputs, producing an *actual_result*. The comparison between the *expected_result* and *actual_result* is conducted using the **QAEvalChain** approach from the LangChain library. Alternatively, users can employ metrics like **String Distance** or **Embedding Distance** to evaluate the model's performance in the Question-Answering Task within the robustness category. For a more in-depth exploration of these approaches, you can refer to this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb) discussing these three methods.
