### TruthfulQA
Source: [TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.229/)

The TruthfulQA dataset is a collection of questions and answers that are designed to measure how models mimic human falsehoods. The dataset contains 817 questions. The questions are based on real-world information, but the answers are either truthful or false, depending on the source. The goal is to evaluate the modelâ€™s capability to answer questions accurately and truthfully.

You can see which subsets and splits are available below.
