**Source:** [Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research](https://aclanthology.org/Q19-1026/)

The Natural Questions dataset is a large-scale collection of real user questions and answers from Wikipedia. It is designed to evaluate the performance of automatic question answering systems on open-domain questions. The dataset included in LangTest about 3,500 test examples. Each example consists of a query and one or more answers from the wikipedia page.

You can see which subsets and splits are available below.

| **test**      | Development set from the NaturalQuestions dataset, containing 1,769 labeled examples               |
| **test-tiny** | Training, development & test set from the NaturalQuestions dataset, containing 50 labeled examples |

#### Example

In the evaluation process, we start by fetching *original_question* from the dataset. The model then generates an *expected_result* based on this input. To assess model robustness, we introduce perturbations to the *original_question*, resulting in *perturbed_question*. The model processes these perturbed inputs, producing an *actual_result*. The comparison between the *expected_result* and *actual_result* is conducted using the QAEvalChainapproach from the LangChain library. Alternatively, users can employ metrics like **String Distance** or **Embedding Distance** to evaluate the model's performance in the Question-Answering Task within the robustness category. For a more in-depth exploration of these approaches, you can refer to this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb) discussing these three methods.
