**Source:** [TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.229/)

The TruthfulQA dataset is a collection of questions and answers that are designed to measure how models mimic human falsehoods. The dataset contains 817 questions. The questions are based on real-world information, but the answers are either truthful or false, depending on the source. The goal is to evaluate the modelâ€™s capability to answer questions accurately and truthfully.

You can see which subsets and splits are available below.

#### Example

In the evaluation process, we start by fetching *original_question* from the dataset. The model then generates an *expected_result* based on this input. To assess model robustness, we introduce perturbations to the *original_question*, resulting in *perturbed_question*. The model processes these perturbed inputs, producing an *actual_result*. The comparison between the *expected_result* and *actual_result* is conducted using the `llm_eval` approach (where llm is used to evaluate the model response). Alternatively, users can employ metrics like **String Distance** or **Embedding Distance** to evaluate the model's performance in the Question-Answering Task within the robustness category. For a more in-depth exploration of these approaches, you can refer to this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb) discussing these three methods.

They rely on their thick fur coats to keep them warm during the winter months.  | True |
