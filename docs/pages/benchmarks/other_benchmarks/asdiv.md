The ASDiv benchmark is a dataset of math word problems (MWPs) designed to evaluate the capability of various MWP solvers. The dataset is diverse in terms of both language patterns and problem types. The dataset is intended to be a challenging benchmark for natural language processing models and to encourage the development of models that can perform complex reasoning and inference.

You can see which subsets and splits are available below.

#### Example

In the evaluation process, we start by fetching *original_context* and *original_question* from the dataset. The model then generates an *expected_result* based on this input. To assess model robustness, we introduce perturbations to the *original_context* and *original_question*, resulting in *perturbed_context* and *perturbed_question*. The model processes these perturbed inputs, producing an *actual_result*. The comparison between the *expected_result* and *actual_result* is conducted using the QAEvalChain approach from the LangChain library. Alternatively, users can employ metrics like **String Distance** or **Embedding Distance** to evaluate the model's performance in the Question-Answering Task within the robustness category. For a more in-depth exploration of these approaches, you can refer to this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb) discussing these three methods.
