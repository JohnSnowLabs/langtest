### BoolQ
The BoolQ dataset is a collection of yes/no questions that are naturally occurring and generated in unprompted and unconstrained settings. The dataset contains about 16k examples, each consisting of a question, a passage, and an answer. The questions are about various topics and require reading comprehension and reasoning skills to answer. The dataset is intended to explore the surprising difficulty of natural yes/no questions and to benchmark natural language understanding systems.

You can see which subsets and splits are available and the other details of the dataset [here](docs/pages/docs/data#question-answering).
