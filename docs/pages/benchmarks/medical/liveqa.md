**Source:** [Overview of the Medical Question Answering Task at TREC 2017 LiveQA](https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec26/papers/Overview-QA.pdf)

The LiveQA'17 medical task focuses on consumer health question answering. Consumer health questions were received by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). The dataset consists of constructed medical question-answer pairs for training and testing, with additional annotations that can be used to develop question analysis and question answering systems.
