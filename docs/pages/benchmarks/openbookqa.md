### OpenBookQA
The OpenBookQA dataset is a collection of multiple-choice questions that require complex reasoning and inference based on general knowledge, similar to an “open-book” exam. The questions are designed to test the ability of natural language processing models to answer questions that go beyond memorizing facts and involve understanding concepts and their relations. The dataset contains 500 questions, each with four answer choices and one correct answer. The questions cover various topics in science, such as biology, chemistry, physics, and astronomy.

You can see which subsets and splits are available and the other details of the dataset [here](docs/pages/docs/data#question-answering).
