### BigBench
BigBench is a large-scale benchmark for measuring the performance of language models across a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks. It consists of many subtasks, each with its own evaluation metrics and scoring system. The subtasks included in LangTest are:
- Abstract Narrative Understanding
- DisambiguationQA
- DisflQA
- Causal Judgement

You can see which subsets and splits are available and the other details of the dataset [here](docs/pages/docs/data#question-answering).
