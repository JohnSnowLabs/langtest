**Source:** [HellaSwag: Can a Machine Really Finish Your Sentence?](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1472/)

HellaSWAG is a dataset for studying grounded commonsense inference. The samples start with one ore two sentence and the last sentence is left incomplete, there are some possible senseful completions in the dataset and model's completion is compared to them.

You can see which subsets and splits are available below.

#### Example

In the evaluation process, we start by fetching *original_question* from the dataset. The model then generates an *expected_result* based on this input. To assess model robustness, we introduce perturbations to the *original_question*, resulting in *perturbed_question*. The model processes these perturbed inputs, producing an *actual_result*. The comparison between the *expected_result* and *actual_result* is conducted using the QAEvalChainapproach from the LangChain library. Alternatively, users can employ metrics like **String Distance** or **Embedding Distance** to evaluate the model's performance in the Question-Answering Task within the robustness category. For a more in-depth exploration of these approaches, you can refer to this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb) discussing these three methods.
