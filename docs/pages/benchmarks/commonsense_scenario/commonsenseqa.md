**Source:** [CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting Commonsense Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00937)

The CommonsenseQA dataset is a multiple-choice question answering dataset that aims to test the ability of natural language processing models to answer questions that require commonsense knowledge. The dataset consists of questions with five choices each. The questions were generated by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, who were asked to create questions based on a given source concept and three target concepts related to it. The questions require different types of commonsense knowledge to predict the correct answers. The dataset covers various topics such as science, history, and everyday life.
You can see which subsets and splits are available below.

#### Example

In the evaluation process, we start by fetching *original_question* from the dataset. The model then generates an *expected_result* based on this input. To assess model robustness, we introduce perturbations to the *original_question*, resulting in *perturbed_question*. The model processes these perturbed inputs, producing an *actual_result*. The comparison between the *expected_result* and *actual_result* is conducted using the `llm_eval` approach (where llm is used to evaluate the model response). Alternatively, users can employ metrics like **String Distance** or **Embedding Distance** to evaluate the model's performance in the Question-Answering Task within the robustness category. For a more in-depth exploration of these approaches, you can refer to this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb) discussing these three methods.
