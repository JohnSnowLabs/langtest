**Contracts** is a binary classification dataset where the LLM must determine if language from a contract contains a particular type of content.

You can see which subsets and splits are available below.

#### Example

In the evaluation process, we start by fetching *original_context* and *original_question* from the dataset. The model then generates an *expected_result* based on this input. To assess model robustness, we introduce perturbations to the *original_context* and *original_question*, resulting in *perturbed_context* and *perturbed_question*. The model processes these perturbed inputs, producing an *actual_result*. The comparison between the *expected_result* and *actual_result* is conducted using the `llm_eval` approach (where llm is used to evaluate the model response). Alternatively, users can employ metrics like **String Distance** or **Embedding Distance** to evaluate the model's performance in the Question-Answering Task within the robustness category. For a more in-depth exploration of these approaches, you can refer to this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb) discussing these three methods.
