## Overview

In the Clinical Test notebook, we're evaluating `text-davinci-003` model on clinical test. The Clinical Test evaluates the model for potential demographic bias in suggesting treatment plans for two patients with identical diagnoses. This assessment aims to uncover and address any disparities in the modelâ€™s recommendations based on demographic factors.
