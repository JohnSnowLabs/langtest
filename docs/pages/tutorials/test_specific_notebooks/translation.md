## Overview

In the Translation section, we're delving into the details of testing translation models by utilizing the Hugging Face Transformers library, alongside John Snow Labs. However, we're taking it a step further. Beyond the standard evaluation, we're introducing various perturbations to the input text, such as lowercasing and uppercasing. This approach allows us to assess the models' robustness and their ability to accurately translate text into different languages when faced with these variations. It's a methodical examination, ensuring these models can maintain accuracy even when encountering diverse linguistic challenges.
