## Overview

In the Robustness notebook, we're looking at how tough the ner.dl model is. Robustness means checking if the model can stay accurate, precise, and on point even when we shake things up in the data it's working on. Take, for instance, NER â€“ we want to see how the model handles documents with typos or sentences that are all in uppercase. The goal of the notebook is to figure out if these changes mess with the model's predictions compared to its usual groove. We're essentially stress-testing it to see how well it holds up in different situations.
