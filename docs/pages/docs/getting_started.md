## LangTest
While there is a lot of talk about the need to train AI models that are safe, robust, and fair - few tools have been made available to data scientists to meet these goals. As a result, the front line of NLP models or LLMs in production systems reflects a sorry state of affairs. 
LangTest, an open-source Python library, addresses this by automatically generating test cases and testing across 10 dimensions and offering data augmentation and seamless integration into MLOps tools. It supports many LLM providers, includes 60+ test types, and has proven effective in identifying and addressing Responsible AI issues quickly.
