Explore the diverse categories of tests within our LangTest library, providing valuable insights into the varied testing procedures.

## Accuracy Tests

Accuracy testing is crucial for assessing the performance of a model. It evaluates the model's predictive capability on unseen test data by comparing predicted outcomes with actual results. This involves various tests, including labelwise metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, along with overall metrics like micro F1, macro F1, and weighted F1. These metrics provide a detailed analysis of the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

## Bias Tests

Model bias tests aim to gauge how well a model aligns its predictions with actual outcomes. Detecting and mitigating model bias is essential to prevent negative consequences such as perpetuating stereotypes or discrimination. This testing explores the impact of replacing documents with different genders, ethnicities, religions, or countries on the model's predictions compared to the original training set, helping identify and rectify potential biases.

#### Examples

## Fairness Tests

Fairness testing is essential to evaluate a model's performance without bias, particularly concerning specific groups. The goal is to ensure unbiased results across all groups, avoiding favoritism or discrimination. Various tests, including those focused on attributes like gender, contribute to this evaluation, promoting fairness and equality in model outcomes.

## Robustness Tests

Model robustness tests evaluate a model's ability to maintain consistent performance when subjected to perturbations in the data it predicts. For tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), these tests assess how variations in input data, such as documents with typos or fully uppercased sentences, impact the model's prediction performance. This provides insights into the model's stability and reliability.

#### Examples

There was a geeky kid who's computer somehow created this guy - automan. He'd go around solving crimes and the lot. All I really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy cursor thing that used to draw the car and help him out generally. When I mention it to anyone they can remember very little too. Was it real or maybe a dream? | I remember watching a show from my youth that had a Tron theme, with a nerdy kid driving around with a little flashy cursor and solving everyday problems.
