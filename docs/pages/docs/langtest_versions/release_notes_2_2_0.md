[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/benchmarks/Benchmarking_with_Harness.ipynb)
The new Model Ranking & Leaderboard system offers a comprehensive way to evaluate and compare model performance based on various metrics across different datasets. This feature allows users to rank models, retain historical rankings, and analyze performance trends.

**Key Features:**
- **Comprehensive Ranking**: Rank models based on various performance metrics across multiple datasets.
- **Historical Comparison**: Retain and compare previous rankings for consistent performance tracking.
- **Dataset-Specific Insights**: Evaluate model performance on different datasets to gain deeper insights.

**How It Works:**

The following are steps to do model ranking and visualize the leaderboard for `google/flan-t5-base` and `google/flan-t5-large` models.
**1.** Setup and configuration of the Harness are as follows:

```yaml
# config.yaml
model_parameters:
  max_tokens: 64
  device: 0
  task: text2text-generation
tests:
  defaults:
    min_pass_rate: 0.65
  robustness:
    add_typo:
      min_pass_rate: 0.7
    lowercase:
      min_pass_rate: 0.7
```
```python
from langtest import Harness

harness = Harness(
    task="question-answering",
    model={
        "model": "google/flan-t5-base",
        "hub": "huggingface"
    },
    data=[
        {
            "data_source": "MedMCQA"
        },
        {
            "data_source": "PubMedQA"
        },
        {
            "data_source": "MMLU"
        },
        {
            "data_source": "MedQA"
        }
    ],
    config="config.yml",
    benchmarking={
        "save_dir":"~/.langtest/leaderboard/" # required for benchmarking 
    }
)
```

**2**. generate the test cases, run on the model, and get the report as follows:
```python
harness.generate().run().report()
```

**3**. Similarly, do the same steps for the `google/flan-t5-large` model with the same `save_dir` path for benchmarking and the same `config.yaml`

**4**. Finally, the leaderboard can show the model rank by calling the below code.
```python
harness.get_leaderboard()
```
![image](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/assets/23481244/ff741d8e-4fc0-4f94-bcc3-9c67653aaba8)

**Conclusion:**
The Model Ranking & Leaderboard system provides a robust and structured method for evaluating and comparing models across multiple datasets, enabling users to make data-driven decisions and continuously improve model performance.


### **🔍 Efficient Few-Shot Model Evaluation**
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/llm_notebooks/Fewshot_QA_Notebook.ipynb)
Few-Shot Model Evaluation optimizes and evaluates model performance using minimal data. This feature provides rapid insights into model capabilities, enabling efficient assessment and optimization with limited examples.

**Key Features:**
- **Few-Shot Techniques**: Evaluate models with minimal data to gauge performance quickly.
- **Optimized Performance**: Improve model outputs using targeted few-shot prompts.
- **Efficient Evaluation**: Streamlined process for rapid and effective model assessment.

**How It Works:**
**1.** Set up few-shot prompts tailored to specific evaluation needs.
```yaml
# config.yaml
prompt_config:
  "BoolQ":
    instructions: >
      You are an intelligent bot and it is your responsibility to make sure 
      to give a concise answer. Answer should be `true` or `false`.
    prompt_type: "instruct" # instruct for completion and chat for conversation(chat models)
    examples:
      - user:
          context: >
            The Good Fight -- A second 13-episode season premiered on March 4, 2018. 
            On May 2, 2018, the series was renewed for a third season.
          question: "is there a third series of the good fight?"
        ai:
          answer: "True"
      - user:
          context: >
            Lost in Space -- The fate of the castaways is never resolved, 
            as the series was unexpectedly canceled at the end of season 3.
          question: "did the robinsons ever get back to earth"
        ai:
          answer: "True"
  "NQ-open":
    instructions: >
      You are an intelligent bot and it is your responsibility to make sure 
      to give a short concise answer.
    prompt_type: "instruct" # completion
    examples:
      - user:
          question: "where does the electron come from in beta decay?"
        ai:
          answer: "an atomic nucleus"
      - user:
          question: "who wrote you're a grand ol flag?"
        ai:
          answer: "George M. Cohan"

tests:
  defaults:
    min_pass_rate: 0.8
  robustness:
    uppercase:
      min_pass_rate: 0.8
    add_typo:
      min_pass_rate: 0.8
```
**2.** Initialize the Harness with `config.yaml` file as below code
```python
harness = Harness(
                  task="question-answering", 
                  model={"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct","hub":"openai"}, 
                  data=[{"data_source" :"BoolQ",
                        "split":"test-tiny"},
                        {"data_source" :"NQ-open",
                         "split":"test-tiny"}],
                  config="config.yaml"
                  )
```
**3.** Generate the test cases, run them on the model, and then generate the report.

```python
harness.generate().run().report()
```

**How It Works:**
The following are steps to import the `DataAugmenter` class from LangTest.
**1.** Create a config.yaml for the data augmentation.
```yaml
# config.yaml
parameters:
    type: proportion
    style: new
tests:
    robustness:
        uppercase:
            max_proportion: 0.2
        lowercase:
            max_proportion: 0.2

```
**2.** Initialize the `DataAugmenter` class and apply various tests for augmentation to your datasets.
```python
from langtest.augmentation import DataAugmenter
from langtest.tasks.task import TaskManager

data_augmenter = DataAugmenter(
    task=TaskManager("ner"), # use the ner, text-classification, question-answering...
