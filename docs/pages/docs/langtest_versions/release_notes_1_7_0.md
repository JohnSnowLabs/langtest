## 🔥 New Features

### Enhanced Question-Answering Evaluation

Enhanced the QA evaluation capabilities of the LangTest library by introducing two categories of distance metrics: Embedding Distance Metrics and String Distance Metrics. These additions significantly broaden the toolkit for comparing embeddings and strings, empowering users to conduct more comprehensive QA evaluations. Users can now experiment with different evaluation strategies tailored to their specific use cases.

| Cosine similarity | Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. |
| Euclidean distance | Calculates the straight-line distance between two points in space. |
| Manhattan distance | Computes the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of two vectors. |
| Chebyshev distance | Determines the maximum absolute difference between elements in two vectors. |
| Hamming distance  | Measure the difference between two equal-length sequences of symbols and is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. |

| levenshtein       | Calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to transform one string into another. |
| damerau_levenshtein | Similar to Levenshtein distance but allows transpositions as a valid edit operation. |
| Indel             | Focuses on the number of insertions and deletions required to match two strings. |

### Wino-Bias on LLMs

In this update, we address gender bias assessment in LLMs using a revamped evaluation method. The initial testing of this dataset was conducted using the HuggingFace masked model. However, in this release, we address this testing process using LLMs (Large Language Models ) by transforming it into a Question-Answer (Q/A) format and requiring the models to complete the sentences by selecting gender-specific pronouns from multiple-choice questions (MCQs)

The blue highlighting effect draws attention to the relative success in handling the "gender-occupational-stereotype" test case. It's worth noting that concerns have been raised about the AI21 model's potential bias towards one gender, which might have contributed to its poor performance in this specific test case.

### StereoSet Integration
With the addition of StereoSet as a new task and dataset within the LangTest library, designed to evaluate models by assessing the probabilities of alternative sentences, specifically stereotypic and anti-stereotypic variants, enhances the library's capabilities in addressing linguistic biases and stereotypes. This integration provides users with a valuable tool for model assessment and bias mitigation.
