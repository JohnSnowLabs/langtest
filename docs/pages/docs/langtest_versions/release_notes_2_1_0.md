[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/llm_notebooks/Generic_API-Based_Model_Testing_Demo.ipynb)

This feature empowers you to seamlessly integrate virtually any language model hosted on an external API platform. Whether you prefer OpenAI, Hugging Face, or even custom vLLM solutions, LangTest now adapts to your workflow. `input_processor` and `output_parser` functions are not required for openai api compatible server.

#### Key Features:

- **Effortless API Integration:** Connect to any API system by specifying the API URL, parameters, and a custom function for parsing the returned results. This intuitive approach allows you to leverage your preferred language models with minimal configuration.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Define the URL, parameters specific to your chosen API, and a parsing function tailored to extract the desired output. This level of control ensures compatibility with diverse API structures.

- **Unparalleled Flexibility:** Generic API Support removes platform limitations. Now, you can seamlessly integrate language models from various sources, including OpenAI, Hugging Face, and even custom vLLM solutions hosted on private platforms.

#### How it Works:

**Parameters:**
Define the `input_processer` function for creating a payload and the `output_parser` function is used to extract the output from the response.

```python
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "<YOUR API KEY>"
model_url = f"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key={GOOGLE_API_KEY}"

# headers
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}

# function to create a payload
def input_processor(content):
    return {"contents": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "parts": [
                {
                    "text": content
                }
            ]
        }
    ]}

# function to extract output from model response
def output_parser(response):
    try:
        return response['candidates'][0]['content']['parts'][0]['text']
    except:
        return ""
```

To take advantage of this feature, users can utilize the following setup code:

```python
from langtest import Harness

# Initialize Harness with API parameters
harness = Harness(
    task="question-answering",
    model={
        "model": {
            "url": url,
            "headers": headers,
            "input_processor": input_processor,
            "output_parser": output_parser,
        },
        "hub": "web",
    },
    data={
        "data_source": "OpenBookQA",
        "split": "test-tiny",
    }
)
# Generate, Run and get Report
harness.generate().run().report()
```

This comprehensive analysis strengthens your confidence in the model's real-world performance.

#### How it works:

Initiate the Harness class
```python
harness = Harness(
    task="question-answering",
    model={"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", "hub": "openai"},
    data=[
        {"data_source": "NQ-open", "split": "test-tiny",},
        {"data_source": "MedQA", "split": "test-tiny"},
        {"data_source": "LogiQA", "split": "test-tiny"},
    ],
)
```
Configure the accuracy tests in Harness class
```python
harness.configure(
    {
        "tests": {
            "defaults": {"min_pass_rate": 0.65},
           
            "accuracy": {
                "llm_eval": {"min_score": 0.60},
                "min_rouge1_score": {"min_score": 0.60},
                "min_rouge2_score": {"min_score": 0.60},
                "min_rougeL_score": {"min_score": 0.60},
                "min_rougeLsum_score": {"min_score": 0.60},
            },
        }
    }
)
```
harness.generate() generates testcases, .run() executes them, and .report() compiles results.
```python
harness.generate().run().report()

### How it works:

First, create the `parameter.json` or `parameter.yaml` in the working directory

**JSON Format**
```json
{
    "task": "question-answering",
    "model": {
        "model": "google/flan-t5-base",
        "hub": "huggingface"
    },
    "data": [
        {
            "data_source": "MedMCQA"
        },
        {
            "data_source": "PubMedQA"
        },
        {
            "data_source": "MMLU"
        },
        {
            "data_source": "MedQA"
        }
    ],
    "config": {
        "model_parameters": {
            "max_tokens": 64,
            "device": 0,
            "task": "text2text-generation"
        },
        "tests": {
            "defaults": {
                "min_pass_rate": 0.70
            },
            "robustness": {
                "add_typo": {
                    "min_pass_rate": 0.70
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Yaml Format**
```yaml
task: question-answering
model:
  model: google/flan-t5-base
  hub: huggingface
data:
- data_source: MedMCQA
- data_source: PubMedQA
- data_source: MMLU
- data_source: MedQA
config:
  model_parameters:
    max_tokens: 64
    device: 0
    task: text2text-generation
  tests:
    defaults:
      min_pass_rate: 0.70
    robustness:
      add_typo:
        min_pass_rate: 0.7

```
And open the terminal or cmd in your system 
```bash
langtest eval --model <your model name or endpoint> \
              --hub <model hub like hugging face, lm-studio, web ...> \
              -c < your configuration file like parameter.json or parameter.yaml>
```
Finally, we can know the leaderboard and rank of the model.
