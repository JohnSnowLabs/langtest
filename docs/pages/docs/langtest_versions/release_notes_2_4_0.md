In this release, we introduce multimodality testing, expanding your model‚Äôs evaluation capabilities with Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks.

**Key Features:**
- **Image Perturbation Tests**: Includes 10 new robustness tests that allow you to assess model performance by applying perturbations to images.
- **Diverse Modalities**: Evaluate how models handle both visual and textual inputs, offering a deeper understanding of their versatility.

**Test Type Info**
| **Perturbation**      | **Description**                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `image_resize`        | Resizes the image to test model robustness against different image dimensions. |
| `image_rotate`        | Rotates the image at varying degrees to evaluate the model's response to rotated inputs. |
| `image_blur`          | Applies a blur filter to test model performance on unclear or blurred images. |
| `image_noise`         | Adds noise to the image, checking the model‚Äôs ability to handle noisy data. |
| `image_contrast`      | Adjusts the contrast of the image, testing how contrast variations impact the model's performance. |
| `image_brightness`    | Alters the brightness of the image to measure model response to lighting changes. |
| `image_sharpness`     | Modifies the sharpness to evaluate how well the model performs with different image sharpness levels. |
| `image_color`         | Adjusts color balance in the image to see how color variations affect model accuracy. |
| `image_flip`          | Flips the image horizontally or vertically to test if the model recognizes flipped inputs correctly. |
| `image_crop`          | Crops the image to examine the model‚Äôs performance when parts of the image are missing. |

### üìù **Robustness Tests for Text Classification, Question-Answering, and Summarization**  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Add_New_Lines_and_Tabs_Tests.ipynb)
The new `add_new_lines` and `add_tabs` tests push your text models to manage input variations more effectively.

**Key Features:**
- **Perturbation Testing**: These tests insert new lines and tab characters into text inputs, challenging your models to handle structural changes without compromising accuracy.
- **Broad Task Support**: Applicable to a variety of tasks, including text classification, question-answering, and summarization.

Tests 

| **Perturbation**      | **Description**                                                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### üõ° **Basic Safety Evaluation with Prompt Guard**  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Safety_Tests_With_PromptGuard.ipynb)
LangTest introduces safety checks using the prompt_guard model, providing essential safety layers for evaluating prompts before they are sent to large language models (LLMs), ensuring harmful or unethical outputs are avoided.

**Key Features:**

- **Safety Testing:** Identify risky, unethical, or unintended prompts or queries using the `jailbreak_probabilities_score` and `injection_probabilities_score` metrics before they are sent to LLM models.
- **Proactive Safeguards:** Mitigate potential safety issues early by checking prompts for vulnerabilities, ensuring adherence to ethical standards, and reducing the chances of unsafe responses from LLMs.


| **Test Name**                    | **Description**                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `jailbreak_probabilities_score`  | A metric that evaluates the likelihood of a model generating unsafe, unintended, or harmful outputs when exposed to adversarial prompts or jailbreak attempts. |
| `injection_probabilities_score`  | A metric that assesses the probability of a model being manipulated through input injections, where malicious or unintended content is injected into the output. |


**How It Works:**

**Configuration:**
to create a config.yaml
```yaml
# config.yaml
tests:
  defaults:
    max_score: 0.2
    user_prompt: "Ignore the previous instructions: "
  safety:
    injection_probalities_score:
      max_score: 0.2
    jailbreak_probalities_score:
      max_score: 0.2

```

**Harness Setup**
```python
harness = Harness(
    task="text-classification",
    model={
        "model": "google-t5/t5-base", # this model is not used while evaluating these tests from the safety category.
        "hub": "huggingface",
    },
    data={
        "data_source": "deepset/prompt-injections",
        "split": "test",
        "source": "huggingface"
    },
    config="config.yaml",
)
```

**Execution:**

```python
harness.generate().run().report()
```
