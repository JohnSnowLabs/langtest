## 2.3.1
------------------
## Description

In this patch version, we've resolved several critical issues to enhance the functionality and bugs in the **LangTest** developed by JohnSnowLabs. Key fixes include correcting the NER task evaluation process to ensure that cases with empty expected results and non-empty predictions are appropriately flagged as failures. We've also addressed issues related to exceeding training dataset limits during test augmentation and uneven allocation of augmentation data across test cases. Enhancements include improved template generation using the OpenAI API, with added validation in the Pydantic model to ensure consistent and accurate outputs. Additionally, the integration of Azure OpenAI service for template-based augmentation has been initiated, and the issue with the Sphinx API documentation has been fixed to display the latest version correctly.

## üêõ Fixes
- **NER Task Evaluation Fixes:**
  - Fixed an issue where NER evaluations passed incorrectly when expected results were empty, but actual results contained predictions. This should have failed. [#1076]
  - Fixed an issue where NER predictions had differing lengths between expected and actual results. [#1076]
 - **API Documentation Link Broken**: 
   - Fixed an issue where Sphinx API documentation wasn't showing the latest version docs. [#1077]
- **Training Dataset Limit Issue:**
  - Fixed the issue where the maximum limit set on the training dataset was exceeded during test augmentation allocation. [#1085]
- **Augmentation Data Allocation:**
  - Fixed the uneven allocation of augmentation data, which resulted in some test cases not undergoing any transformations. [#1085]
- **DataAugmenter Class Issues:**
  - Fixed issues where export types were not functioning as expected after data augmentation. [#1085]
- **Template Generation with OpenAI API:**
  - Resolved issues with OpenAI API when generating different templates from user-provided ones, which led to invalid outputs like paragraphs or incorrect JSON. Implemented structured outputs to resolve this. [#1085]

## ‚ö° Enhancements
- **Pydantic Model Enhancements:**
  - Added validation steps in the Pydantic model to ensure templates are generated as required. [#1085]
- **Azure OpenAI Service Integration:**
  - Implemented the template-based augmentation using Azure OpenAI service. [#1090]
- **Text Classification Support:**
  - Support for multi-label classification in text classification tasks is added. [#1096]
 - **Data Augmentation**:
   - Add JSON Output for NER Sample to Support Generative AI Lab [#1099][#1100]
