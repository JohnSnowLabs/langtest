## 1.9.0

## 📢 Highlights

**LangTest 1.9.0 Release by John Snow Labs 🚀**

We're excited to announce the latest release of LangTest, featuring significant enhancements that bolster its versatility and user-friendliness. This update introduces the seamless integration of Hugging Face Callback, empowering users to effortlessly utilize this renowned platform. Another addition is our Enhanced Templatic Augmentation with Automated Sample Generation. We also expanded LangTest's utility in language testing by conducting comprehensive benchmarks across various models and datasets, offering deep insights into performance metrics. Moreover, the inclusion of additional Clinical Datasets like MedQA, PubMedQA, and MedMCQ broadens our scope to cater to diverse testing needs. Coupled with insightful blog posts and numerous bug fixes, this release further cements LangTest as a robust and comprehensive tool for language testing and evaluation.

-  Integration of Hugging Face's callback class in LangTest facilitates seamless incorporation of an automatic testing callback into transformers' training loop for flexible and customizable model training experiences.

- Enhanced Templatic Augmentation with Automated Sample Generation: A key addition in this release is our innovative feature that auto-generates sample templates for templatic augmentation. By setting generate_templates to True, users can effortlessly create structured templates, which can then be reviewed and customized with the show_templates option. 

- In our Model Benchmarking initiative, we conducted extensive tests on various models across diverse datasets (MMLU-Clinical, OpenBookQA, MedMCQA, MedQA), revealing insights into their performance and limitations, enhancing our understanding of the landscape for robustness testing.

- Enhancement: Implemented functionality to save model responses (actual and expected results) for original and perturbed questions from the language model (llm) in a pickle file. This enables efficient reuse of model outputs on the same dataset, allowing for subsequent evaluation without the need to rerun the model each time.

- Optimized API Efficiency with Bug Fixes in Model Calls.

##  🔥 Key Enhancements:

### 🤗 Hugging Face Callback Integration
 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/HF_Callback_NER.ipynb)     
We introduced the callback class for utilization in transformers model training. Callbacks in transformers are entities that can tailor the training loop's behavior within the PyTorch or Keras Trainer. These callbacks have the ability to examine the training loop state, make decisions (such as early stopping), or execute actions (including logging, saving, or evaluation). LangTest effectively leverages this capability by incorporating an automatic testing callback. This class is both flexible and adaptable, seamlessly integrating with any transformers model for a customized experience.

Create a callback instance with one line and then use it in the callbacks of trainer:
```python
my_callback = LangTestCallback(...)
trainer = Trainer(..., callbacks=[my_callback])
```

| Parameter             | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| **task**              | Task for which the model is to be evaluated (text-classification or ner) |
| **data**              | The data to be used for evaluation. A dictionary providing flexibility and options for data sources. It should include the following keys: <br>• data_source (mandatory): The source of the data.<br>• subset (optional): The subset of the data.<br>• feature_column (optional): The column containing the features.<br>• target_column (optional): The column containing the target labels.<br>• split (optional): The data split to be used.<br>• source (optional): Set to 'huggingface' when loading Hugging Face dataset. |
| **config**            | Configuration for the tests to be performed, specified in the form of a YAML file. |
| **print_reports**     | A bool value that specifies if the reports should be printed. |
| **save_reports**      | A bool value that specifies if the reports should be saved. |
| **run_each_epoch**    | A bool value that specifies if the tests should be run after each epoch or the at the end of training |

Users can now enable the automatic generation of sample templates by setting generate_templates to True. This feature utilizes the advanced capabilities of LLMs to create structured templates that can be used for templatic augmentation.To ensure quality and relevance, users can review the generated templates by setting show_templates to True.

###  🚀 Benchmarking Different Models

In our Model Benchmarking initiative, we conducted comprehensive tests on a range of models across diverse datasets. This rigorous evaluation provided valuable insights into the performance of these models, pinpointing areas where even large language models exhibit limitations. By scrutinizing their strengths and weaknesses, we gained a deeper understanding of the landscape

#### MMLU-Clinical

We focused on extracting clinical subsets from the MMLU dataset, creating a specialized MMLU-clinical dataset. This curated dataset specifically targets clinical domains, offering a more focused evaluation of language understanding models. It includes questions and answers related to clinical topics, enhancing the assessment of models' abilities in medical contexts. Each sample presents a question with four choices, one of which is the correct answer. This curated dataset is valuable for evaluating models' reasoning, fact recall, and knowledge application in clinical scenarios.
