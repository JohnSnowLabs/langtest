## 1.10.0

## 📢 Highlights

🌟 **LangTest 1.10.0 Release by John Snow Labs**

We're thrilled to announce the latest release of LangTest, introducing remarkable features that elevate its capabilities and user-friendliness. This update brings a host of enhancements:

- **Evaluating RAG with LlamaIndex and Langtest**: LangTest seamlessly integrates LlamaIndex for constructing a RAG and employs LangtestRetrieverEvaluator, measuring retriever precision (Hit Rate) and accuracy (MRR) with both standard and perturbed queries, ensuring robust real-world performance assessment.

- **Grammar Testing for NLP Model Evaluation:** This approach entails creating test cases through the paraphrasing of original sentences. The purpose is to evaluate a language model's proficiency in understanding and interpreting the nuanced meaning of the text, enhancing our understanding of its contextual comprehension capabilities.


- **Saving and Loading the Checkpoints:** LangTest now supports the seamless saving and loading of checkpoints, providing users with the ability to manage task progress, recover from interruptions, and ensure data integrity.

- **Extended Support for Medical Datasets:** LangTest adds support for additional medical datasets, including LiveQA, MedicationQA, and HealthSearchQA. These datasets enable a comprehensive evaluation of language models in diverse medical scenarios, covering consumer health, medication-related queries, and closed-domain question-answering tasks.


- **Direct Integration with Hugging Face Models:**  Users can effortlessly pass any Hugging Face model object into the LangTest harness and run a variety of tasks. This feature streamlines the process of evaluating and comparing different models, making it easier for users to leverage LangTest's comprehensive suite of tools with the wide array of models available on Hugging Face.

##  🔥 Key Enhancements:

### 🚀Implementing and Evaluating RAG with LlamaIndex and Langtest
 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/RAG/RAG_OpenAI.ipynb)   

LangTest seamlessly integrates LlamaIndex, focusing on two main aspects: constructing the RAG with LlamaIndex and evaluating its performance. The integration involves utilizing LlamaIndex's generate_question_context_pairs module to create relevant question and context pairs, forming the foundation for retrieval and response evaluation in the RAG system.

To assess the retriever's effectiveness, LangTest introduces LangtestRetrieverEvaluator, employing key metrics such as Hit Rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Hit Rate gauges the precision by assessing the percentage of queries with the correct answer in the top-k retrieved documents. MRR evaluates the accuracy by considering the rank of the highest-placed relevant document across all queries. This comprehensive evaluation, using both standard and perturbed queries generated through LangTest, ensures a thorough understanding of the retriever's robustness and adaptability under various conditions, reflecting its real-world performance.

```
from langtest.evaluation import LangtestRetrieverEvaluator

retriever_evaluator = LangtestRetrieverEvaluator.from_metric_names(
    ["mrr", "hit_rate"], retriever=retriever
)
     
retriever_evaluator.setPerturbations("add_typo","dyslexia_word_swap", "add_ocr_typo") 

# Evaluate
eval_results = await retriever_evaluator.aevaluate_dataset(qa_dataset)

retriever_evaluator.display_results()

```

### 📚Grammar Testing in Evaluating and Enhancing NLP Models
 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/test-specific-notebooks/Grammar_Demo.ipynb)   

Grammar Testing is a key feature in LangTest's suite of evaluation strategies, emphasizing the assessment of a language model's proficiency in contextual understanding and nuance interpretation. By creating test cases that paraphrase original sentences, the goal is to gauge the model's ability to comprehend and interpret text, thereby enriching insights into its contextual mastery.

### 🔥 Saving and Loading the Checkpoints
 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/misc/Saving_Checkpoints.ipynb)     
Introducing a robust checkpointing system in LangTest! The `run` method in the `Harness` class now supports checkpointing, allowing users to save intermediate results, manage batch processing, and specify a directory for storing checkpoints and results. This feature ensures data integrity, providing a mechanism for recovering progress in case of interruptions or task failures.
```
harness.run(checkpoint=True, batch_size=20,save_checkpoints_dir="imdb-checkpoint")
```
The `load_checkpoints` method facilitates the direct loading of saved checkpoints and data, providing a convenient mechanism to resume testing tasks from the point where they were previously interrupted, even in the event of runtime failures or errors.
```
harness = Harness.load_checkpoints(save_checkpoints_dir="imdb-checkpoint",
                                   task="text-classification",
                                   model = {"model": "lvwerra/distilbert-imdb" , "hub":"huggingface"}, )
```
