###  🖼 Enhanced Image Robustness Testing  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/JohnSnowLabs/langtest/blob/main/demo/tutorials/llm_notebooks/Visual_QA_II.ipynb)

We've added new test types for Image Robustness to evaluate your vision models rigorously. Could you challenge your models with diverse image perturbations and assess their ability to adapt?  

#### Key Features  
- **Diverse Perturbations**: Evaluate performance with new image robustness tests.  
- **Vision Model Assessment**: Test adaptability under varied visual conditions.  


Perturbation | Description
-- | --
`image_translate` | Shifts the image horizontally or vertically to evaluate model robustness against translations.
`image_shear` | Applies a shearing transformation to test how the model handles distortions in perspective.
`image_black_spots` | Introduces random black spots to simulate damaged or obscured image regions.
`image_layered_mask` | Adds layers of masking to obscure parts of the image, testing recognition under occlusion.
`image_text_overlay` | Places text on the image to evaluate the model's resilience to textual interference.
`image_watermark` | Adds a watermark to test how the model performs with watermarked images.
`image_random_text_overlay` | Randomly places text at varying positions and sizes, testing model robustness to overlays.
`image_random_line_overlay` | Draws random lines over the image to check the model's tolerance for line obstructions.
`image_random_polygon_overlay` | Adds random polygons to the image, simulating graphical interference or shapes.


#### How it Works:

```python
from langtest.types import HarnessConfig
from langtest import Harness
```

```python
test_config = HarnessConfig(
{
    "evaluation": {
        "metric": "llm_eval",
