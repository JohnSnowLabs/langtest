The Harness is able to load the saved test cases, test configuration and test data. 

```python
# Load saved test cases, test configuration, test data  
harness = Harness.load("path/to/saved_test_folder", model="ner_dl_bert", task='ner', hub="johnsnowlabs")
```

Once the harness is loaded, the test cases can then be run with any new model by calling `harness.run()`.
